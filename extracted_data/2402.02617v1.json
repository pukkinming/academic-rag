In this study, we delve into Acoustic Word Embeddings (AWEs), a fixed-length feature derived from continuous representations, to explore their advantages in specific tasks. AWEs have previously shown utility in capturing acoustic discriminability. In light of this, we propose measuring layer-wise similarity between AWEs and word embeddings, aiming to further investigate the inherent context within AWEs. Moreover, we evaluate the contribution of AWEs, in comparison to other types of speech features, in the context of Speech Emotion Recognition (SER). Through a comparative experiment and a layer-wise accuracy analysis on two distinct corpora, IEMOCAP and ESD, we explore differences between AWEs and raw self-supervised representations, as well as the proper utilization of AWEs alone and in combination with word embeddings. Our findings underscore the acoustic context conveyed by AWEs and showcase the highly competitive SER accuracies by appropriately employing AWEs.",

      "text": "Unlike discrete embeddings of word tokens, speech representations are presented in a continuous form with variable lengths, which can impede their utility in certain scenarios such as query-by-example, voice search, keyword spotting, and word discovery  [1, 2, 3] . Therefore, fixed-dimensional speech representations, specifically Acoustic Word Embeddings (AWEs), have been employed to capture acoustic information in variable-length speech segments  [4] . This process condenses the information in a manner that guarantees segments containing the same words are mapped to similar embeddings. Previous studies have demonstrated that the use of AWEs allows for the application of simple calculations, such as cosine similarity, to measure the distance between different speech segments, as opposed to using computationally expensive methods like dynamic time warping  [5] .\n\nMoreover, owing to the contextualized nature of selfsupervised representations, a simple mean-pooling approach is sufficient to construct AWEs that capture acoustic discriminability which implicitly contains word meanings and sequential information  [6] . To this end, we aim to investigate whether the self-supervised AWEs outperform their continuous form (i.e., the raw frame-level representations) and whether they present similar contextual meanings to their corresponding word embeddings. To achieve this goal, we use Speech Emotion Recognition (SER) as the downstream task for the following reasons:\n\n1) The variable length of frame-level speech representations has posed a longstanding challenge for SER. To standardize the input length, SER usually suffers from either noise introduced by padding or information loss caused by chopping  [7] . Thanks to the fixed length, we hypothesize that AWEs serve as an ideal solution to address this problem, especially when use in combination with word embeddings.\n\n2) SER usually requires both acoustic and lexical information for satisfactory performance. However, the inter-modal incongruity sometimes makes it challenging to combine the two input sources  [8] . As AWEs can discriminate words compared to continuous speech representations, we hypothesize that AWEs align better with word embeddings via proper fusion approaches (e.g., cross-attention) due to their discretized characteristics.\n\nTo validate our hypotheses, in this work, we first compute the layer-wise similarity between AWEs and word embeddings. Subsequently, we build an SER system utilizing AWEs from a self-supervised model HuBERT as input and compare its performance with the raw HuBERT representations, as well as with Mel spectrogram baselines. Additionally, we incorporate BERT embeddings through simple concatenation and cross-attention for comparison, aiming to further understand how AWEs differ from raw self-supervised representations.",

IEMOCAP comprises five dyadic sessions involving ten actors (five male and five female), each engaging in scripted and improvised multimodal interactions. The corpus contains approximately 12 hours of speech annotated by three annotators with ten emotion classes. Consistent with prior research  [13] , we merged Happy and Excited, and excluded utterances without transcripts. This process results in a total of 5,500 utterances utilized in this study, each assigned one label from the following four classes: Angry, Happy, Neutral, and Sad.\n\nESD consists of 17,500 utterances spoken by 10 native English actors, each labeled with one of five different emotions (Angry, Surprise, Sad, Happy, Neutral). A notable feature is the inclusion of parallel data: pairs of utterances with the same content and speaker but different emotions. This design enables control for linguistic content, facilitating the isolation of emotion-related acoustic information, thereby resulting in higher SER accuracies.",

      "text": "In previous research on the layer-wise analysis of selfsupervised speech models, Pasad et al.  [19, 20]  demonstrated that these models encode speech information, progressing from the frame-level to phonetic-level representations and then to word identity and meaning. Li et al.  [13] , Lin et al.  [21] , and Zhu et al.  [22]  applied the representations to prosody-related tasks, confirming the distinctive contributions of different layers. In this study, however, we compare HuBERT AWEs with BERT 2  embeddings, aiming to identify the layers of AWEs that are most sensitive to linguistic information and to explore the contextual distribution of AWEs.\n\nTo this end, we compute the Local Neighborhood Similarity (LNS)  [23]  of a word w between the lexical and acoustic embedding spaces. The underlying idea behind this practice is that if the feature vectors of a given word in two different embedding spaces encode similar contextual information, they will share common local neighbors. The LNS of a word w is determined by the similarity between the set of K nearest neighbors in the HuBERT AWEs (HBA) and BERT word embeddings (BERT ), respectively:\n\nwhere Jaccard distance (intersection over union) between two sets is defined as:\n\nAs an identical pattern is obtained on ESD, we present the results only on IEMOCAP for brevity, which are plotted in Fig.  1 . It is evident that the similarity between acoustic and lexical word embeddings is consistently low, typically ranging between 1% and 2.5%. Across all layers, there is a noticeable peak at layer 9, suggesting that layer 9 encodes acoustic word meanings that more align with the information encoded by the language model, which is consistent with  [20] . Even though, it is worth noting that the value remains low. Moreover, we extract the 5 closest acoustic and lexical neighbors for the words anyhow and after from layer 9 as examples to illustrate the dissimilarity between the two distributions. As seen in Table  1 , while there is one word in common between the two sets of neighbors, acoustic neighbors often share a common vowel sound with the target word, while lexical neighbors tend to be more syntactically related. Alongside the findings from Fig.  1 , it is noted that, despite AWEs being able to acoustically discriminate words  [6] , they demonstrate a distribution distinct from that of word embeddings in terms of context, which we refer to as acoustic context.",

We train a simple neural network classifier with two dense hidden layers (sizes 128 and 16), employing ReLU activation, as sophisticated networks are deemed unnecessary when utilizing powerful self-supervised representations for down-stream tasks  [13, 9] . As our objective is to self-contrast for novel findings rather than compare with the literature, we conduct an 80/20 train/test split instead of cross-validation.

      "section_name": "Comparative Study",
      "text": "We compare three types of acoustic features: Mel spectrograms, raw HuBERT representations, and HuBERT AWEs (referred to as Mel, HuBERT, and AWEs for brevity). For the latter two, we compute the accuracy from every layer and report the average score. Additionally, we explore their fusion with BERT embeddings through concatenation and cross-attention (audio and BERT features attend to each other and are then combined) using the best-performing layer. Note that the feature dimension of Mel differs from that of BERT. Although it is possible to encode Mel to the same dimension as that of BERT for cross-attention, the performance is significantly inferior to HuBERT and AWEs. Thus, for brevity, we only report concatenation for Mel. Each model is trained five times, and we report the average score.\n\nThe results are presented in Table  2  and 3 , and the following findings are observed. 1) Concatenating BERT embeddings significantly improves the performance of Mel. However, the contribution of such lexical information is less pronounced when integrated into HuBERT or AWEs. This observation highlights a previous finding that self-supervised speech features already convey implicit lexical information compared to raw speech features  [6, 19, 13] , rendering BERT embeddings somewhat redundant.\n\n2) On IEMOCAP: The performance using AWEs is slightly inferior to that of using HuBERT, which is reasonable due to information loss caused by mean-pooling during AWEs construction. While AWEs contain context, which may contribute as additional information, such an advantage does not manifest. On the contrary, although AWEs still exhibit lower performance than HuBERT when fused with BERT through cross-attention, the gap between them diminishes (only 0.04). This phenomenon can be attributed to discretized acoustic features (i.e., AWEs) being more easily aligned with word embeddings compared to continuous ones through cross-attention, a mechanism designed to capture relatedness between two representations. This alignment naturally leads to higher enhancement.\n\n3) On ESD: Concatenating BERT embeddings decreases performance compared to using acoustic features alone. On the other hand, cross-attention enhances performance for Hu-BERT, yet has the opposite effect for AWEs. These phenomena are attributed to the fact that sentences in ESD remain unchanged for every emotion, having no contribution to emotion discrimination. Concatenating BERT embeddings only brings redundancy, thereby decreasing performance. Nonetheless, cross-attention with BERT enhances performance as it models the relatedness between the source and target features. Un- like concatenation, which uses the two directly as input, the same BERT embeddings contribute differently to SER based on different acoustic features serving as the query in crossattention. Moreover, we observe that when using acoustic features alone, AWEs outperform HuBERT, contrary to the findings on IEMOCAP. Given that sentences in ESD remain consistent for every emotion, this setup facilitates the acoustic context (explained in Sec. 4.1) as an indicator for SER. In contrast, sentences in IEMOCAP vary, making the acoustic context less predictable and challenging to leverage.",

As similar layer-wise patterns have been found in both corpora, we omit IEMOCAP for brevity (the major differences have been described in the last section with Table  2 ). By comparing the two figures, we can observe several differences between HuBERT raw representations and AWEs: 1) Using AWEs alone consistently outperforms the two fusions, yet using HuBERT alone underperforms crossattention at most layers. 2) On the shallow layers, AWEs have significant advantages over raw HuBERT, and the optimal layer for using AWEs is around layer 3 instead of the middle layer. 3) When using raw HuBERT, the discrepancy among the three input types diminishes after the middle layer. This is because the deeper layers start encoding lexical information, which holds little value in ESD. In contrast, when using AWEs, the discrepancy persists, showcasing the advantage of  the acoustic context represented by AWEs in situations where lexical information has minimal impact. 4) When using AWEs, the last layer does not exhibit a drop that commonly observed in raw self-supervised representations  [19, 13, 20] . Instead, the performances rise, offering a solution for more effectively leveraging the last layer representations.",
