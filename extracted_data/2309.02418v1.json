In this paper, to achieve unsupervised personalized emotion recognition, we first pre-train an encoder with learnable speaker embeddings in a self-supervised manner to learn robust speech representations conditioned on speakers. Second, we propose an unsupervised method to compensate for the label distribution shifts by finding similar speakers and leveraging their label distributions from the training set.

      "text": "With the ubiquity of voice assistive technologies, speech emotion recognition (SER) is becoming increasingly important as it allows for a more natural and intuitive interaction between humans and machines. Although SER technology has made significant progress in recent years, accurately detecting emotions from speech remains a challenging task. This is partly due to the vast variability in how people express their feelings through speech, which can depend on culture  [1] , gender  [2] , or age  [3] , among others. Personalization is a promising solution to address the variability of emotional expression in speech. By tailoring emotion recognition systems to match individuals' unique expressive behaviors, the approach can lead to a more robust and inclusive model that is better equipped to accurately detect emotions for a wide range of users.\n\nExisting studies on personalized emotion recognition generally use hand-crafted features of speech on datasets with a small number of speakers (ten or fewer speakers)  [4, 5, 6, 7, 8] . Recently, SER systems achieve state-of-the-art results  [9, 10]  via fine-tuning large pre-trained speech encoders such as Hu-BERT  [11]  or wav2vec2.0  [12] . This raises three important questions:  (1)  What happens to the personalization gap as the number of speakers increases for fine-tuned encoders? (2) How do existing personalization methods behave when the input speech features are not fixed? (3) How can we incorporate personalization with pre-trained encoders to boost performance?\n\nIn this paper, we perform extensive experiments on the MSP-Podcast corpus  [13]  with more than 1,000 speakers to an-* Equal contribution swer these questions. We first show that as the number of speakers increases, the personalization gap (the performance difference between speaker-dependent and speaker-independent) of fine-tuned models decreases, which motivates the need for methods that adapts the pre-trained weights for personalization prior to fine-tuning. Hence, we propose to continue the pretraining process of the speech encoder jointly with speaker embeddings (see Figure  2 (a) ). We also introduce a simple yet effective unsupervised personalized calibration step to adjust label distribution per speaker for better accuracy (see Figure  2 (b) ). The proposed methods are unsupervised, requiring no prior knowledge of the test labels. Experimental results on arousal and valence estimation show that the proposed methods achieve state-of-the-art results for valence estimation while consistently outperforming the encoder fine-tuning baseline and a recent personalization method evaluated on the same dataset  [14] . The major contributions of this work are as follows.  (1)  We propose a method for personalized adaptive pre-training to adjust the existing speech encoders for a fixed set of speakers.\n\n(2) We propose an unsupervised personalized post-inference technique to adjust the label distributions. (3) We provide extensive experimental results along with an ablation study to demonstrate the effectiveness of the methods. (4) We further show that our methods can be extended to unseen speakers without the need to re-train any component, achieving superior performance compared to the baselines.",

      "text": "Adaptive Pre-training. Adaptive pre-training resumes the pretraining process for the pre-trained encoders on either domain data (domain adaptive pre-training) or task data (task adaptive pre-training) to improve the downstream task performance of a specific domain or dataset  [15] . The method has been shown to be highly effective for a wide range of natural language processing and computer vision applications such as machine translation  [16] , sentiment analysis  [17] , and image classification  [18] . In the field of speech emotion recognition, Chen et al.  [10]  propose a novel pseudo-label generation method in combination with task-adaptive pre-training for wav2vec2.0  [12]  to boost emotion recognition accuracy. However, there is no prior work exploring personalized adaptive pre-training. Personalized Speech Emotion Recognition. There have been a few methods  [5, 8, 4, 6, 14]  proposed for personalized SER. However, most of the existing work are validated on datasets with limited speakers. Most relevant to our work is the unsupervised personalized method proposed by Sridhar et al.  [14] , which is validated on the same dataset (MSP-Podcast) as in this paper. They propose to find speakers in the train set to form the adaptation set whose acoustic patterns closely resemble those of the speakers in the test set. Specifically, they apply Principal Component Analysis (PCA) on the feature set proposed for the computational paralinguistics challenge (ComParE)  [19]  and fit Gaussian Mixture Models to measure the speaker similarity based on the KL divergence metric. Samples of the selected speakers are given more weight during the training process. With a light architecture, i.e., the multi-layer perceptron, the method is shown to be highly effective for valence personalization. However, it requires extra training (model adaptation) during inference and thus can not be extended to new speakers.\n\nIn contrast to prior work, we explore personalization with fine-tuned encoders instead of pre-extracted features, which achieves superior performance compared to the best-performing models. For example, our weakest baseline (HuBERT-large fine-tuning) achieves a two times higher Concordance Correlation Coefficient (CCC) compared to the reported results from Sridhar et al.  [14]  for valence estimation. More importantly, our method is extensible and remains effective for unseen speakers without the need to re-train any components.",

      "text": "Problem Formulation. Unsupervised personalized speech emotion recognition: Given a speech dataset containing N utterances with emotion labels (arousal or valence) and speaker IDs D = {(ui, yi, si)} N i=1 . We assume access to all information except for the emotion labels of the test set during the training phase. Our goal is to produce a robust emotion recognition model that performs better than a model exposed to the same amount of data excluding speaker ID information. We further want our method to be extensible to new speakers outside of D. Dataset. We use the MSP-Podcast corpus  [13]  as our dataset D. MSP-Podcast is the largest corpus for speech emotion recognition in English, containing emotionally rich podcast segments retrieved from audio-sharing websites. Each utterance in the dataset is annotated using crowd-sourcing with continuous labels of arousal, valence, and dominance along with categorical emotions. In this paper, we focus on arousal and valence estimation. The labels range from 1 to 7. The dataset contains pre-defined train, validation, and test sets, namely Dtr, D val , Dte, which are subject independent. We use two versions of the dataset, namely v1.6 and v1.10, for the experiments. To be consistent with prior studies  [20, 14, 9] , most of our experiments are based on MSP-Podcast v1.6. We remove all the utterances marked with \"Unknown\" speakers in accordance with our problem formulation. Following Sridhar et al.  [14] , we split the test set into two subsets test-a and test-b that share the same set of speakers. Each speaker in test-a contains 200s of speech in total while test-b contains the rest of the recordings. test-a is used to train speaker-dependent models along with the train set. For experiments on the unseen speakers, we evaluate the models on the speakers who are in the v1.10 test set but not in the v1.6 test set, namely test-c. Table  1  provides the details and statistics of our splits for the MSP-Podcast dataset. Pre-trained Speech Encoder. In this work, we use HuBERT [11] as our pre-trained encoder E due to its superior performance  [9, 21] . HuBERT consists of two main components, namely a 1D CNN and a Transformer encoder  [22] . The 1D CNN takes raw waveforms as inputs and returns low-level feature representations of speech. Then, the features are passed into the Transformer encoder to generate high-level feature representations via the self-attention mechanism. During the pretraining process, HuBERT first generates pseudo-labels by performing K-means clustering on the pre-extracted features, e.g., MFCCs. Then, the model learns in a self-supervised manner through the task of predicting pseudo-labels for randomly masked frames. Therefore, the pre-training loss Lpt for Hu-BERT can be defined as the sum of the cross-entropy loss computed over the masked frames. Personalization Gap. To motivate our proposed methodology, we investigate the potential gain from the personalization of fine-tuned HuBERT on valence regression (the dimension with the most potential gain from personalization as demonstrated by Sridhar et al.  [14] ). In particular, we first create subsets D k tr of Dtr with k speakers, where k ∈ {50, 100, 250, 500, 987}. Speaker-independent models with k speakers are trained on D k tr sets. To make the results stable, we ensure that D i tr ⊂ D j tr , ∀i < j. For speaker-dependent models with k speakers, we randomly remove 50 speakers (# speakers in test-a) from D k tr to get Dk tr , and fine-tune the models on Dk tr ∪ test-a. For all experiments, we fine-tune the HuBERT-base encoder on the generated sets and report the performance on test-b. Since test-a and test-b share the same set of speakers, we consider the performance of speaker-dependent models to loosely correlate with the performance of supervised personalization methods, and hence, the performance gap between speaker-dependent and speaker-independent models captures the potential gain from personalization. Figure  1  demonstrates the inverse relationship between k and the performance gap. The evaluation metric is the Concordance Correlation Coefficient (CCC ↑). It suggests that given sufficiently large and diverse training data, the pre-trained encoders become robust enough to learn both the general emotional patterns and the unique characteristics of different groups of speech expressions such that supervised training of the model on the test speakers leads to marginal gains. Hence, to enhance the performance of the pre-trained encoders for a target speaker, we can: (1) make the input data personalized (pre-processing); (2) modify the weights of the pre-trained encoder for the target speaker; or (3) adjust the label predictions to be more personalized (post-processing). Existing studies on personalized SER, e.g.,  [5, 8, 14] , focus on the first approach. In this work, we explore the other two alternatives. [21] find that there is a huge variance across the per-speaker performance. We investigate whether the performance variance is due to the feature shift or the label shift. Specifically, to measure the feature and label shift for each target speaker, we calculate the KL divergence between the feature and label distributions of the target speaker and those of the whole training set. Then we calculate the Pearson correlation coefficient (PCC) between the feature/label shift and the speaker performance. For arousal estimation, we find that the PCC between the feature shift and the regression performance is -0.714 while the PCC between the label shift and performance is -0.502. The results suggest that both feature and label shifts contribute to the performance variance. Moreover, the correlation between the feature shift and label shift is 0.285, which suggests the potential of using features to detect and remove label shifts.",

      "text": "Personalized Adaptive Pre-training (PAPT). Inspired by prior study in task-adaptive pre-training  [15]  and the problem of feature shift described above, we propose to perform adaptive pre-training on D = {(ui, si)} N i=1 along with trainable speaker embeddings in a self-supervised manner. Specifically, in addition to the original speech encoder E, we train a speaker embedding network S to extract the speaker embedding ei = S(si) ∈ R d , where d is the embedding size for the Transformer. Then, the speaker embedding ei is summed with the utterance feature fi = E(ui) to get a personalized feature representation f p i = fi + ei. For personalized pre-training, f p i is used to compute the pre-training loss (cross-entropy) on pseudo-label prediction for masked frames.\n\nwhere N b is the number of utterances in the batch, Mi is the number of masked frames for utterance ui, and lit denotes the pseudo-label for the t-th masked frame in utterance ui. For ER downstream tasks, we reduce the temporal dimension for f p i by mean-pooling and feed the output to a fully-connected layer to produce the label predictions. Personalized Label Distribution Calibration (PLDC). Motivated by the problem of label distribution shift described above, we further want to add a personalized post-inference technique to correct the predicted label distributions. Specifically, given the predictions for a target speaker, the main idea is to identify the most similar speakers from the train set based on the feature similarity and use their label distribution statistics (means and standard deviations) to calibrate the predicted label distributions of the target test speaker. In particular, for speaker s in both the train and test set, we extract the features for each utterance of s and average them to form the speaker vector\n\nwhere E p f t denotes the ER-fine-tuned model of E p (the personalized adapted version of E), Ēp f t (u k s ) denotes the mean-pooled vector representation for utterance u k s , and Ns is the number of utterances from speaker s.\n\nThen, for each speaker in the test set, we retrieve the top-k most similar speakers in the train set based on the cosine similarity between the speaker vectors. Next, we average the label distribution statistics from the retrieved speakers to get an estimation of the mean μ and standard deviation σ. Finally, each predicted label y for the target speaker would be shifted as\n\nwhere µ and σ are the mean and standard deviation for the predicted label distribution. Optionally, if we want to only shift the mean or standard deviation, we can replace μ as µ or σ as σ in the above equation, respectively.",

      "text": "Implementation and Training Details. We perform adaptive pre-training for ten epochs using the Adam optimizer with a linear learning rate scheduler (5% warm-up and a maximum learning rate of 1e -5 ) on a single NVIDIA Quadro RTX8000 GPU. The models are adaptively pre-trained on the combination of the official train, validation, and test-b sets and validated on test-a. All other settings are identical to HuBERT's pre-training configurations. For downstream fine-tuning experiments, we add a light interpreter on top of the HuBERT encoder to process the mean-pooled extracted representations. The interpreter consists of two fully-connected layers of size {128, 32} with ReLU activation, 1D BatchNorm, and a dropout ratio of 0.1 inbetween the layers. The downstream models are fine-tuned for at most ten epochs using Adam optimizer (5e -5 learning rate) with early stopping. Following prior work  [14] , the models are optimized with a CCC loss LCCC = 1 -CCC for arousal and valence estimation. All of our experiments are performed with the HuBERT-large architecture, except for the personalization   2  shows the comparison between our proposed methods and the baselines on MSP-Podcast. Compared to the best-performing baselines, our methods achieve superior performance on both arousal and valence estimation, with a gain of 0.023 and 0.009 on arousal and valence A-CCC respectively. Notably, we achieve state-of-the-art results for the task of valence estimation, in which our Overall-CCC score achieves 0.665 (on the whole test set of MSP-Podcast v1.6) compared to 0.627 as reported by Sriniva et al.  [9] . When using PLDC, we can observe a significant increase in A-CCC, which suggests performance improvement for individual speakers. However, we can also see that as A-CCC improves with PLDC, O-CCC generally decreases. We attribute this to the high variance in the number of utterances of each speaker in the test set. Furthermore, Table  2  also demonstrates that PLDC consistently achieves the best performance when we only perform σ shifting, while µ shifting often reduces both A-CCC and O-CCC. We hypothesize that it is more difficult to estimate the mean than the (high) variance for a speaker with a wide range of arousal/valence labels.\n\nEvaluations on Unseen Speakers. We further validate the robustness of our method on unseen speakers (test-c). We directly make inference with E p f t on test-c without re-training any components. Specifically, for each utterance from an unseen speaker, we provide E p f t with a training speaker embedding as a proxy for the unseen speaker. We apply the same strategy used in our PLDC module, in which we compute a vector representation for the current unseen speaker and each speaker in the train set as in Equation  2 . However, we use the original pre-trained encoder E instead of E p f t as the model cannot extract feature representation for the current (unseen) speaker without a proxy speaker. We then use the (seen) speaker in the train set with the highest similarity score as a proxy for the current speaker. The retrieved proxy speakers can later be used for the PLDC module to further boost prediction performance, as demonstrated in   4  shows the experimental results for arousal estimation on test-b of fine-tuned encoders (without PLDC) adaptively pre-trained with different fusion positions of the speaker embeddings. In particular, Last refers to our proposed setting in which the speaker embeddings are added to the output of the Transformer encoder; First refers to speaker embeddings being added to the inputs of the first layer of the Transformer encoder, and Prefix refers to the setting in which the speaker embeddings are concatenated as prefixes to the inputs of the Transformer encoder. None refers to the vanilla Hu-BERT encoder. We also provide L val pt , the best pre-train loss on the validation set, i.e., test-a, during the PAPT phase. We find that Last provides the best results.",
