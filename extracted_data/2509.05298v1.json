This paper introduces Livia, an emotionaware augmented reality (AR) companion app designed to provide personalized emotional support by combining modular artificial intelligence (AI) agents, multimodal affective computing, progressive memory compression, and AR-driven embodied interaction. Livia employs a modular AI architecture with specialized agents responsible for emotion analysis, dialogue generation, memory management, and behavioral orchestration, ensuring robust and adaptive interactions. Two novel algorithms-Temporal Binary Compression (TBC) and Dynamic Importance Memory Filter (DIMF)-effectively manage and prioritize long-term memory, significantly reducing storage requirements while retaining critical context. Our multimodal emotion detection approach achieves high accuracy, enhancing proactive and empathetic engagement. User evaluations demonstrated increased emotional bonds, improved satisfaction, and statistically significant reductions in loneliness. Users particularly valued Livia's adaptive personality evolution and realistic AR embodiment. Future research directions include expanding gesture and tactile interactions, supporting multi-user experiences, and exploring customized hardware implementations.",

      "text": "Loneliness has reached epidemic levels globally, with nearly half of all adults in the United States reporting significant loneliness in recent years  [1] . Chronic loneliness and social isolation pose severe health risks, including heightened depression and increased mortality rates comparable to smoking 15 cigarettes per day  [1] . In response, researchers and practitioners have increasingly turned to technological interventions, notably AI-driven companion apps or virtual agents, as accessible tools to provide emotional support, conversation, and companionship. AI companions such as Replika have grown popular among individuals coping with loneliness, frequently serving as friends or informal mental health supporters  [2] . A recent study involving 1,006 young adults using Replika showed that while these users experienced significantly higher levels of loneliness compared to average peers, they still perceived substantial social support from their AI companion  [3] . Remarkably, 3% of users reported that interaction with the AI companion prevented suicidal ideation  [3] . These findings underline the potential for thoughtfully designed AI companions to meaningfully impact emotional and mental well-being.\n\nHowever, despite these promising outcomes, current virtual companions exhibit considerable limitations. Most commercial chatbots remain emotionally superficial, relying heavily on scripted responses or simple pattern matching, thus lacking genuine empathy or deep personalization  [2, 3] . These companions typically possess limited or no capability for long-term memory, resulting in repetitive and contextually insensitive interactions. Additionally, emotional state detection is often restricted to basic textual sentiment analysis, neglecting important multimodal cues such as voice tone. Further, most AI companions present a fixed or slowly evolving personality, limiting their ability to resonate deeply and adaptively with individual users. Over time, such superficial interactions may fail to establish sustained, meaningful relationships, ultimately undermining the companions' effectiveness.\n\nTo address these critical challenges, we introduce Livia, an emotion-aware augmented reality (AR) companion integrating advanced affective computing, modular multi-agent architectures, efficient long-term memory management, and interactive AR experiences. Our system aims to deliver personalized emotional support-perceiving emotions, recalling personal context, and dynamically adapting interactions with empathy.\n\nOur key contributions include:\n\n• Novel Modular Architecture: A robust, extensible multi-agent AI framework designed specifically for emotional and conversational interactions.",

Users ranged from 18 to 34 years old (74% female, 26% male), all English speakers from North America. Each chat excerpt was labeled for emotion (happiness, sadness, anxiety, anger, neutral) by two independent human raters (inter-rater agreement: 0.82, Cohen's kappa). Livia's model achieved an overall accuracy of 88%, outperforming a basic text-only version of Livia (75% accuracy). For high-intensity emotions-especially anxiety-adding voice tone improved precision to 92% (vs. 71% with text only). • User Engagement: User engagement was tracked over four weeks with 38 participants. On average, users had 7.9 conversations per day, each lasting about 4.8 minutes. Compared to a standard text-only version of Livia, users interacting with the full multimodal version had 31% higher engagement. • Memory Compression: We tested memory compression algorithms across all user logs (11,504 conversation turns in total). On average, per-user memory storage was reduced from 50KB to 15KB over the evaluation period, without a loss in key recall performance. To measure recall, we defined \"important events\" as moments users referenced again in later chats. Livia accurately recalled these important events 92% of the time, and less significant details (referenced only once or not brought up again) 65% of the time.\n\n• AR Rendering and Qualitative Feedback: All participants used Livia with AR rendering enabled. In structured surveys and follow-up interviews with 24 users, common themes included Livia's perceived empathy, realistic AR visuals, and a strong preference for Livia over text-only chatbots. Several users highlighted the value of Livia's lifelike presence and emotional responsiveness. For example, one user commented, \"Livia felt like a real friend who actually remembers what I said yesterday.\" • Limitations: The main limitations were sample size, demographic homogeneity (all participants were from North America and relatively young), and English-only data. Additionally, emotion labels were assigned by human raters rather than directly by users, which could introduce some subjective bias. Participants reported strong emotional bonds with Livia and high overall satisfaction. Many described Livia as a comforting presence, highlighting empathy-driven interactions and appealing AR visuals.",

      "text": "The proliferation of AI companionship raises critical ethical considerations, particularly around emotional reliance. Researchers have expressed concern that prolonged dependence on AI companions could lead to diminished human interaction and emotional deskilling, undermining users' capacities to maintain healthy relationships and manage emotional complexity  [10] . Livia directly addresses these concerns by explicitly focusing on a form of companionship analogous to a friend, magical diary, or trusted confidant, deliberately avoiding romantic or erotic dimensions that are often linked to more profound emotional risks. This design philosophy aims to build trustworthy, supportive interactions without inadvertently promoting unhealthy emotional dependencies or substituting critical human relationships  [11] . However, even with these safeguards, there remains a risk that users could become overly reliant on Livia, potentially leading to decreased engagement with human social networks. To mitigate this, Livia proactively encourages users to sustain and enhance their existing human relationships, intentionally positioning itself as a supportive resource rather than a replacement for genuine human interaction  [12] .\n\nMoreover, AI companion applications like Livia inherently offer significant benefits related to inclusivity and diversity. By carefully designing interaction models, developers can overcome biases commonly present in broader AI systems, such as underrepresentation of marginalized groups or insensitivity towards different genders, sexual orientations, ages, or disabilities  [13] . Livia prioritizes diverse user needs and contexts, thus fostering an inclusive environment that respects and validates the identities of typically marginalized or overlooked communities. Such intentional inclusivity not only broadens the accessibility of emotional support but also reinforces fundamental human rights by creating spaces that are safe, affirming, and welcoming for all users  [14] .\n\nUltimately, the ethical challenge lies in designing AI companions during a time when the long-term effects of human-AI emotional interaction remain uncertain. Although creating AI companions with human-like qualities can amplify both risks and benefits, emphasizing their supportive role in strengthening rather than replacing human relationships can significantly mitigate the risk of social displacement  [12] . As with human relationships, when a companion actively encourages nurturing existing social connections, the likelihood of detrimental replacement effects can be substantially reduced  [12] .",

Continuous AR rendering presents technical challenges, notably battery drain, overheating, and high computational demands. To address these, efficient rendering algorithms, adaptive frame rates, and optimized resource allocation are essential. Leveraging edge computing and on-device processing can further improve battery life and responsiveness.\n\nPrivacy is critically important given the extensive collection of sensitive multimodal user data-including text inputs, voice recordings, facial expressions, and potentially physiological signals. Studies in affective computing emphasize the heightened sensi-tivity and potential risks associated with emotional and psychological data if inadequately protected  [15] . To address these concerns, robust data encryption, secure storage protocols, transparent privacy policies, and explicit user consent mechanisms are indispensable. Advanced privacy-preserving technologies can further mitigate data misuse risks, enhance user trust, and support long-term adoption.\n\nThe variability in an individual's emotional expression across different moods poses challenges for reliable emotion recognition and adaptive responsiveness. Users exhibit diverse behaviors depending on their emotional context, complicating accurate interpretation by AI systems. Adaptive algorithms capable of continuous personalization and learning from nuanced emotional changes are therefore essential to ensure contextually appropriate and individually tailored interactions.\n\nAddressing these real-world deployment challenges is vital for ensuring the practical feasibility, ethical soundness, and long-term effectiveness of emotionally-aware AR companions like Livia.",
