      "text": "The fusion of multimodal sensory information forms the cornerstone of human perception and cognition  [12] . However, the realms of multimodal fusion and Modality Missingness pose significant challenges within the field of affective computing. Modality Missingness refers to the unavailability of multimodal information in real-world affective computing tasks, where only certain specific modalities can be utilized. In affective computing, Modality Missingness poses significant challenges to methods based on text  [18, 32, 46] , audio  [6, 33] , video  [34] , and the like. Even for multimodal approaches  [1, 26] , performance can significantly deteriorate in environments where modalities are absent. The unpredictable nature of Modality Missingness can drastically diminish the accuracy and robustness of computational models designed to interpret human emotions. This issue becomes even more pronounced in dynamic and unstructured environments, where the availability of multimodal data may be inconsistent.\n\nRecent advancements in neuroscience have underscored the phenomenon of cross-modal plasticity  [4, 7, 9] , wherein the lack of input from one sensory modality leads to compensatory enhancements in the processing capabilities of others  [10, 13, 15] ,. For instance, in the case of individuals with vision loss, certain neurons in the primary visual cortex, which would typically process visual stimuli, can be recruited by other sensory modalities to enhance their processing capabilities  [16, 35, 38] . This observation aligns with the everyday experience of heightened auditory and tactile sensitivities in individuals who are blind. Such insights reflect the brain's remarkable ability to reorganize and optimize sensory processing under constrained conditions  [39] . In the field of emotional understanding, Albert Mehrabian proposed the 7%-38%-55% rule  [31] , which suggests that 7% of emotional information is conveyed through verbal expression, 38% through tone of voice, and 55% through facial expressions, highlighting the predominant role of visual information.\n\nDynamic Facial Expression Recognition (DFER) represents a pivotal downstream task within the realm of affective computing, placing a greater emphasis on the understanding of visual emotions. This is consistent with Albert's theory. Additionally, a distinct advantage within the DFER domain is that the datasets inherently provide raw visual information, as DFER necessitates original facial data for the recognition of emotions. In contrast, other visual-based affective computing tasks often process their data into features, significantly constraining us to test our methods in scenarios that more closely resemble real-world conditions. Based on this, we explore the avenues of Modality Missingness and multimodal fusion within the context of multimodal DFER tasks.\n\nInspired by these insights, as well as the use of multiple prompts in continuous learning tasks, we propose a Unified Modality Brainlike Emotional net for affective computing, named UMBEnet, marking a paradigm shift in the challenge of unified modal emotional understanding. UMBEnet's design draws inspiration from the brain's ability to reconfigure and augment its processing capabilities in response to sensory deprivation, integrating a Dual-Stream (DS) structure and a Sparse Feature Fusion (SFF) module. We have designed a Prompt Pool (First Stream) that employs trainable multiple prompts and a mechanism that simulates neural impulse transmission, capable of fully harnessing multimodal information, and blending it with inherent prompts (Second Stream) that store emotional information to form a Dual-Stream mechanism. Prompts are considered analogous to neurons in the brain, capable of storing a certain amount of information. The design of the Prompt Pool aims to emulate the brain's ability to select and interpret information in varying contexts, particularly in environments where modalities are absent. The design of inherent prompts seeks to emulate the activation of the amygdala, the emotional center of the brain, integrating multimodal information for judgment. SFF introduces a mechanism akin to actual neural impulse transmission. Considering that most features carry low-value information for transmission, sparse matrix fusion mimics the sparsity of neural impulse transmission in the brain  [2] , sparsely blending the prompts from the dual-stream mechanism. Inspired by the 7%-38%-55% rule, we designed an imbalanced multimodal encoder within UMBEnet. This encoder allocates a larger proportion of parameters to visual processing, reflecting the leading role of visual information in emotion recognition, while reducing the parameters for textual and auditory processing.\n\nUMBEnet introduces several innovations to affective computing, with three main contributions:\n\n• We innovatively combined inherent prompts with a Prompt Pool to design and introduce a Dual-Stream (DS) structure. This dual-stream approach ensures a comprehensive understanding of human emotions by leveraging the strengths of different sensory modalities.\n\n• Our framework includes a Sparse Feature Fusion (SFF) module, optimizing the use of available sensory data. By sparsely integrating modality fusion prompts with inherent prompts, this module allows for the efficient fusion of multimodal information, significantly enhancing the robustness and accuracy of emotion recognition across diverse scenarios.\n\n• Drawing inspiration from the neural anatomical structure of the human brain, UMBEnet employs a Brain-like Emotional Processing Framework (BEPF). This biomimetic design closely mimics the human brain's emotional center, not only offering a more natural and effective way of understanding emotions but also improving system performance in emotion recognition tasks.\n\nThese contributions collectively enable UMBEnet to consistently outperform existing SOTA methods in DFER domain, particularly in scenarios involving multimodality and modal absence.",

      "text": "In Dynamic Facial Expression Recognition (DFER), the trend has shifted from static to dynamic analysis, emphasizing temporal dynamics in expressions  [44] . This shift is propelled by deep learning advancements, with 3D Convolutional Neural Networks (C3D) capturing both spatial and temporal data dimensions  [42] , and Transformers like Visual Transformers (ViT) excelling in feature extraction and sequence processing  [11] . These innovations offer refined emotion recognition, addressing the complexities of video data and long-term dependencies in facial expressions. Furthermore, contrastive learning methods, exemplified by CLIP  [37]  and its enhancement, CLIPER  [24] , have forged synergies between visual and textual modalities, elevating recognition precision across diverse scenarios. Our approach diverges from the aforementioned methodologies by adopting a novel brain-inspired architecture, deviating from the conventional design philosophies of DFER methods. Our approach, particularly the prompt pool design and activation mechanism, innovatively addresses the challenge of missing modalities, merging inherent prompts within our SSF framework. This fusion not only aids in managing multimodal data but also enriches the interpretability of DFER systems.",

Let the original inputs for visual, textual, and audio modalities be 𝑋 𝑣 , 𝑋 𝑡 , 𝑋 𝑎 respectively. The corresponding modal encoders 𝐸 𝑣 , 𝐸 𝑡 , 𝐸 𝑎 transform these inputs into high-dimensional feature vectors, such that 𝐹 𝑣 , 𝐹 𝑡 , 𝐹 𝑎 ∈ R 𝐵×𝐹 . :\n\nwhere 𝐸 𝑚𝑜𝑑𝑎𝑙 represent the encoder functions for visual, textual, and audio inputs, respectively. Next, these feature vectors are fed into an adaptive self-attention module for information fusion. In the adaptive self-attention module, features from each modality are weighted and combined to generate a comprehensive multimodal embedding 𝐹 𝑓 𝑢𝑠𝑖𝑜𝑛 :\n\nIn the adaptive self-attention mechanism AdaptiveFusion, we utilize the Query (Q), Key (K), and Value (V) mechanisms of the Transformer for information processing and the module requires an additional modal mask matrix:\n\nwhere 𝑄, 𝐾, and 𝑉 represent the Query, Key, and Value matrices, respectively, and 𝑑 𝑘 is the dimensionality factor for appropriate scaling. 𝑀 represents the modal mask matrix that is added to the scaled dot products of the queries and keys. Through self-attention mechanism and the modal mask matrix, our model can generate specialized attention weights for each modal feature, thereby optimizing the fusion process and ensuring that meaningful final outputs 𝐹 𝑓 𝑢𝑠𝑖𝑜𝑛 can still be produced even when some modal information is missing. After fusion by the adaptive self-attention module, the synthesized embedding 𝐹 𝑓 𝑢𝑠𝑖𝑜𝑛 is sent into a predefined Prompt Pool with the purpose of finding a set of prompts that best match the current situation. Let the Prompt Pool be 𝑃 = {𝑝 1 , 𝑝 2 , ..., 𝑝 𝑛 }, the selection of the most matching set of prompts can be represented as:\n\nIn the Prompt Pool, the process involves searching for the embedding most similar to the current multimodal input information, and then using that embedding as the Key to find the corresponding prompt as the Value. This process ensures that the selected prompt can be decoupled from the current multimodal input information and can also learn information missing from the modalities.\n\nFinally, the prompts selected from the Prompt Pool are concatenated with original learnable prompts to form the final prompt representation 𝑃 𝑓 𝑖𝑛𝑎𝑙 . Thereafter, 𝑃 𝑓 𝑖𝑛𝑎𝑙 together with 𝐹 𝑓 𝑢𝑠𝑖𝑜𝑛 are used to compute the contrastive loss to identify the closest emotion category:\n\nWhere 𝑗 traverses all possible category prompts. By minimizing the contrastive loss L 𝑐𝑜𝑛𝑡𝑟𝑎𝑠𝑡 , UMBEnet learns to accurately map multimodal inputs to their corresponding emotional categories.",

      "text": "The Prompt Pool 𝑃 contains a series of predefined textual prompts, each aimed at representing a specific emotional state or scenario. We define the Prompt Pool as 𝑃 = {𝑝 1 , 𝑝 2 , ..., 𝑝 𝑛 }, where 𝑛 is the size of the Prompt Pool, and each 𝑝 𝑗 ∈ 𝑃 represents a specific emotional scenario or state. Each 𝑝 𝑗 can be further represented as a set of Key-Value pairs, i.e., (𝑘 𝑗 , 𝑣 𝑗 ), where 𝑘 𝑗 and 𝑣 𝑗 respectively represent the key and value. In our framework, the value 𝑣 𝑗 corresponds to a piece of prompt, while the key 𝑘 𝑗 is used to associate the prompt with a specific state.\n\nIn Figure  3 , within the Prompt Pool, unimodal features correspond to unimodal prompts, while multimodal fused features correspond to multimodal prompts. This mechanism enables our model to fully capitalize on multimodal information, effectively addressing the challenges posed by missing modalities.\n\nThe value part 𝑣 𝑗 of each prompt 𝑝 𝑗 is a sequence of tokens of length 𝐿 𝑝 , embedded into the same embedding space 𝐷 as the multimodal features 𝐹 𝑓 𝑢𝑠𝑖𝑜𝑛 , expressed as:\n\nHere, 𝑣 𝑗𝑖 represents the embedding vector of the 𝑖-th token in 𝑣 𝑗 .\n\nIn UMBEnet, the function of the Prompt Pool is not merely to provide a fixed set of textual collections for the model to choose from. By adopting a learnable key-value pair structure, we allow the model to dynamically select the most matching prompt while dealing with a specific multimodal input. This matching process can be realized by calculating the similarity between the input features 𝐹 𝑓 𝑢𝑠𝑖𝑜𝑛 and each key 𝑘 𝑗 , then selecting the prompt with the highest similarity for subsequent processing.\n\nWhere cos denotes the cosine similarity function, 𝑗 * is the index of the prompt most matching with the fused feature 𝐹 𝑓 𝑢𝑠𝑖𝑜𝑛 , and 𝑝 * is the value of the selected prompt. Figure  4  illustrates how key-value pairs simulate the mechanism of neural impulse transmission: Neurotransmitters are released by one neuron, bind to receptors, and transmit neural impulses, where the content of transmission is not the neurotransmitter itself but transforms into electrical signals. Inspired by this, both our key and value are set to be trainable. The key is trained to align with the query's latent space, while the value is trained to learn modal information. Similarity between query and key is computed through different mapping functions, and the corresponding value is outputted.\n\nThrough this mechanism, the key-value pairs in the Prompt Pool make the connection coupled, not only enhancing the interpretability of the model but also improving its adaptability to different states. This design allows UMBEnet to respond more flexibly and accurately when facing complex multimodal emotion recognition tasks.\n\nThe design of the Prompt Pool (𝑃) and the concatenation with inherent prompts aim to mimic the brain's strategy of activating different neurons for varying tasks, particularly under Modality Missingness. For a set of prompts, the process of selecting and The operation of the activation mechanism modeled after neural impulse transmission is depicted on the left. In this process, neurotransmitters, once received by receptors during transmission, convert not into the neurotransmitters themselves but into electrical signals, analogous to a specialized key-value pair system where receptors and electrical signals correlate. The top right corner illustrates the query function, representing selectable mapping functions within this framework. This neural-inspired approach provides a biomimetic method for prompt activation, reflecting the intricacy and efficiency of neural communication in UM-BEnet's architecture.\n\nconcatenating prompts can be formalized as:\n\nwhere 𝑘 represents the number of prompt to be selected, and 𝑇𝑜𝑝 𝑘 denotes select the largest k indexes from the sequence of the cosine similarity between the fused features 𝐹 𝑓 𝑢𝑠𝑖𝑜𝑛 and 𝑘𝑒𝑦.

Suppose the set of 𝑡𝑜𝑘 𝑝 most matching prompts selected from the Prompt Pool forms 𝑃 * = {𝑝 * 1 , 𝑝 * 2 , . . . , 𝑝 * 𝑡𝑜𝑝 𝑘 }, where each 𝑝 * 𝑖 is a prompt value corresponding to a specific emotional state selected through the aforementioned process.\n\nNext, these selected prompts are sent into a sparse feature fusion process to capture their interactions and their relations with the original multimodal information:\n\nWhere 𝑃 ′ represents the set of prompts processed by the SSF mechanism.\n\nThe SSF is implemented through a series of linear layers and ReLU activations, finalized with L1 regularization for sparsity, followed by another linear layer and a sigmoid function to compute a sparse matrix. Specifically, for a given input 𝑋 , the sparse feature fusion can be expressed as:\n\nand 𝑊 1 , 𝑊 2 are weight matrices, 𝑏 1 , 𝑏 2 are bias terms, and 𝜎 is the sigmoid function ensuring the output is in the (0, 1) range, simulating the sparsity in neural activations.\n\nDuring the sparse feature fusion process, L1 regularization is applied to the weight matrix 𝑊 1 to promote sparsity. The new cost function incorporating L1 regularization for the weight matrix 𝑊 1 is given by:\n\nwhere 𝐿(𝑊 1 ) is the cost function after regularization, 𝐿(𝑜𝑟𝑖) is original loss, 𝜆 is the regularization parameter, and 𝑊 1,𝑖 represents the elements of the weight matrix 𝑊 1 . The regularization term encourages the sparsity in 𝑊 1 by penalizing the absolute values of the weights. Then, the obtained set of prompts 𝑃 ′ is concatenated with a set of inherent learnable prompts 𝑃 𝑖𝑛ℎ𝑒𝑟𝑒𝑛𝑡 , forming a comprehensive set of prompts 𝑃 𝑐𝑜𝑚𝑏𝑖𝑛𝑒𝑑 = 𝑃 ′ ⊕ 𝑃 𝑖𝑛ℎ𝑒𝑟𝑒𝑛𝑡 , where ⊕ denotes the concatenation operation. This process aims to combine dynamically selected prompts with fixed, task-related inherent prompts to enhance the model's expressiveness and adaptability.\n\nFinally, we use the contrastive loss to optimize the model, ensuring the selected set of prompts matches correctly with the multimodal input information. The model outputs the final emotional classification results by evaluating the match between 𝐹 𝑓 𝑢𝑠𝑖𝑜𝑛 and each category-corresponding comprehensive set of prompts 𝑃 𝑐𝑜𝑚𝑏𝑖𝑛𝑒𝑑 :\n\nIn this way, UMBEnet can use multimodal information and rich semantic prompts for accurate emotion recognition.",

Initially, the system inputs audio (A), visual (V), and textual (T) modalities separately to tailor prompts specific to each modality. This first phase of training ensures that the prompts are finely tuned to respond to the unique features of each input type.\n\nIn the subsequent phase, prompts that were activated in the first stage are transferred to a new Prompt Pool. Here, the system undergoes training with randomly missing modal information, simulating scenarios where certain modalities may be miss or incomplete. This two-tiered training approach allows the model to delve deeply into the nuances of modal information, effectively leveraging the partial knowledge obtained from each modality to compensate for any missing data. Through this strategy, UMBEnet enhances its capacity to interpret complex emotional prompts by becoming proficient at drawing inferences from incomplete or asymmetrically available data. The employment of this training regime not only promotes the robustness of the system in handling real-world scenarios where multimodal data might not always be complete but also aligns with the cognitive flexibility inherent in human emotional understanding, where inferences are often drawn from partial information.",

The initial learning rate was set to 0.002, and we adopted a mini-batch training approach with a batch size of 16. Furthermore, to prevent overfitting and improve the model's generalization ability, we designed a dynamic learning rate adjustment mechanism based on the performance on the validation set. Specifically, if there is no significant decrease in loss on the validation set for three consecutive training epochs, the learning rate will be reduced to 0.6 times its original value. When the learning rate drops below 1 × 10 -7 , we consider the model to have reached early convergence, at which point the training process will be terminated.

Notably, our approach holds its ground even against methods such as MAE that have been pretrained on extensive data-a comparison often deemed unfair due to the considerable advantages conferred by extensive pre-training. Moreover, our method substantially outperforms the CLIP-based methods that utilize the same backbone as ours, underscoring the efficacy of UMBEnet in processing emotional data.\n\nAmong the methods that do not rely on large pre-training models, our method surpasses the SOTA AEN method by 4.56% (WAR) and 7.89% (UAR) in scenarios with missing modalities in unimodal settings, and extends the lead to 5.56% (WAR) in multimodal settings. Against SOTA CLIP-based methods with the same backbone, our method outperforms DFER-CLIP by 4.94% (WAR). Remarkably, even against the self-supervised MAE-DFER method, which has been pre-trained on extensive datasets, our method exceeds performance by 1.14% (UAR on DFEW), 0.89% (UAR on FERV39K), 0.03% (WAR on FERV39K), and 0.73% (WAR on MAFW) across the three datasets of DFEW, FERV39K, and MAFW in unimodal scenarios. It's important to note that comparisons with self-supervised methods are often considered unfair due to their training on vast amounts of data. On multimodal datasets, our method comprehensively surpasses existing methods, with UMBEnet exceeding MAE-DFER by 6.41% (UAR on MAFW) and 13.72% (WAR on MAFW). Tables 2 and 3 display the superior performance of our approach in the domain of multimodal DFER. DFEW and MAFW represent the two largest datasets in the field of DFER, with DFEW comprising audio and video modalities, where our method achieves SOTA results. The MAFW dataset includes three modalities: audio, video, and text. However, the text modality lacks neutral label annotations. Introducing filler noise text information leads to an artificially high accuracy in neutral classification, suggesting that the model may be learning from noise. Given the novelty of the dataset, previous DFER methods have not highlighted this issue, and the absence of confusion matrices or open-source code from those studies precludes a fair comparison. Therefore, we recalculated WAR and UAR for a 10-class scheme, excluding neutral accuracy, as shown in Table  3 .\n\nOur approach significantly outperforms the existing SOTA methods in a multimodal 11-class setting, and even with the neutral class removed in a 10-class configuration, our method still substantially surpasses the SOTA with a 7.08% increase in UAR and a 9.33% increase in WAR. Comparisons in the 10-class setting, with missing modalities, reveal that the most effective modality is visual, followed by textual, with audio being the least effective. It is evident that our method significantly outperforms the existing SOTA methods, both for the 11-class and the reduced 10-class configurations.\n\nIn our experiments with missing modalities in Table  3 , we discovered that inferring with a full-modal model in the absence of certain modalities can achieve, or even surpass, the performance of training unimodal models from scratch. This is attributed to the two-stage training strategy employed within the full-modal model, suggesting that information from different modalities can often be cross-utilized to enhance performance. This finding underscores the efficacy of our approach in leveraging cross-modal information, thereby boosting the robustness and adaptability of the model in handling missing modal scenarios.",

      "text": "Cross-modal plasticity refers to the brain's ability to adjust and reorganize its functions to enhance the processing capabilities of other sensory modalities following the loss or absence of input from a particular sensory modality. This phenomenon primarily involves neural plasticity, which is the structural and functional changes in neurons and neural networks under the influence of experience or the environment. These changes include the formation, strengthening, or weakening of synapses, and the establishment of new neural pathways. In cases of sensory deprivation, such as blindness or deafness, the brain regions originally receiving input from the now-absent modality no longer do so. Instead, neural centers of other modalities may take over these areas, reallocating and optimizing their functions. For example, in experiments involving visual deprivation and auditory enhancement, the brain areas originally processing visual information, such as the visual cortex, begin to process auditory or tactile information. This reorganization can lead to increased auditory and tactile sensitivity, as observed in the extraordinary auditory localization abilities of blind individuals. Similarly, in experiments involving auditory deprivation and visual/tactile enhancement, individuals with hearing loss exhibit enhanced visual and tactile functions, such as improved visualspatial processing abilities and heightened tactile perception. The mechanisms underlying cross-modal plasticity involve a variety of molecular and cellular events, such as changes in neurotrophic factors, synaptic connectivity reorganization, and the rebalancing of inhibitory and excitatory neurotransmissions. The brain utilizes these mechanisms to optimize the remaining sensory inputs to compensate for the lost senses. This plasticity helps individuals adapt to sensory loss and enhances the functions of other senses, revealing the brain's remarkable adaptability to changes in sensory inputs.\n\nNeuroanatomy is the scientific field that studies the structure and function of the brain, including how the brain processes information through its complex network structures. Specifically, in the context of multimodal information processing, neuroanatomy demonstrates how the brain integrates information from our various sensory systems, including vision, hearing, touch, smell, and taste. The parietal lobe, located in the upper part of the brain, is a primary area for processing tactile, visual, and spatial information. The temporal lobe primarily handles auditory information and some visual memory. It contains several key multimodal areas, such as the superior temporal sulcus (STS), which is an important area for integrating visual and auditory information related to facial expressions and body movements, as well as associated sounds. Additionally, the temporal lobe is involved in language comprehension and emotional processing. The frontal lobe, located at the front of the brain, is central to decision-making, planning, and social behavior. The dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) within the frontal lobe is key for multimodal information processing, responsible for merging information from different sensory sources to support complex cognitive tasks such as problem-solving and decision-making. The insula, deep within the brain, acts as an integration center for information from multiple sensory systems, playing a critical role in regulating emotional responses, pain perception, taste, smell, and visceral sensations. Its role in multimodal information processing includes integrating internal and external sensory signals and assessing emotionally relevant stimuli. The amygdala, a critical area in the brain for processing emotional responses, especially in managing emotions like fear and happiness, receives and integrates various sensory information, such as visual and auditory signals that relate to emotional responses and social prompts. Multimodal information processing relies not only on the functions of individual brain regions but also on extensive neural networks.

      "text": "In the field of affective computing, leveraging information from various sensory channels is crucial for a nuanced understanding and interpretation of human emotions. Inspired by the theory of crosschannel plasticity, we propose a new unified channel paradigm for affective computing, named UMBEnet. UMBEnet seamlessly integrates multimodal information across visual, auditory, and textual domains to create a more proficient system that enhances the accuracy and resilience of emotion recognition efforts. Our approach is grounded in the complex neuroanatomical structures of the human brain, incorporating a brain-like emotional processing framework that utilizes inherent cues and dynamic cue pools, along with sparse feature fusion techniques. Rigorous experimental validation on the most scalable benchmarks in the DFER field-specifically, DFEW, FERV39k, and MAFW-has definitively confirmed that UMBEnet We believe that the BEPF framework, DS structure, and SFF module proposed in this paper offer significant guidance for addressing issues of fusion and modality absence within the multimodal domain. Our work provides the multimodal community with a novel and distinct model framework for multimodal fusion and addressing modality absence, differing from previous approaches. In the future, we aim to extend the BEPF framework to more multimodal domains, believing it to be a transferable multimodal framework that requires minimal modification for adaptation.",
