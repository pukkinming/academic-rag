      "text": "We present ACAD, an affective computational advertising framework expressly derived from perceptual metrics. Different from advertising methods which either ignore the emotional nature of (most) programs and ads, or are based on axiomatic rules, the ACAD formulation incorporates findings from a user study examining the effect of within-program ad placements on ad perception. A linear program formulation seeking to achieve (a) genuine ad assessments and (b) maximal ad recall is then proposed. Effectiveness of the ACAD framework is confirmed via a validational user study, where ACAD-induced ad placements are found to be optimal with respect to objectives (a) and (b) against competing approaches.",

      "text": "Video advertising has grown by leaps and bounds thanks to multimedia publishers like Vimeo and YouTube, and popular movie streaming services such as Netflix and Hulu. As humans are emotional, video advertisements (ads) are designed to evoke specific emotions in viewers employing a variety of narrative tools to effectively convey a message. Ad designers intend that these emotions become associated with the advertised product (message), and that they influence subsequent consumer behavior  1  .\n\nAds (commercials) are typically interspersed within longer, often-emotional programs to occasionally distract viewers as well as generate revenue for content publishers. Advertising in broadcast television involves presentation of relevant ads at fixed temporal locations in the program, but a manual mix-and-match strategy would not scale to online content where millions of program videos and ads exist. Algorithmic video-in-video advertising (VIVA) formulations  [1, 2]  attempt to jointly select appropriate ads from an inventory, plus their insertion locations within a program. VIVA as a computational problem needs to balance the conflicting goals of a) minimal viewing experience disruption, and b) maximal ad impact, so that viewers readily recall ads and associated messages over the long term.\n\nCAVVA or computational affective advertising  [1]  works by matching program scenes and ads with respect to valence (positive or negative emotional feeling) and arousal (extent of physiological activation)  [3] , so that viewing experience and ad recall are maximized. CAVVA rules model two axioms, namely, (1) the emotional inertia hypothesis  [4] , which Figure  1 : ACAD Overview: Given an emotional program video comprising multiple scenes (blue oval), and an ad inventory (green oval), ACAD employs linear integer programming to select and embed the requisite number of ads at optimal temporal locations to synthesize a video program sequence. ACAD is derived from a user-study examining placement-induced evaluation of affective ads. Ad selections (in red) and placements are determined as a function of (a) ad valence ratings, and (b) the degree of emotional dissimilarity-plus-content similarity between ads and program scenes. ACAD is evaluated via a validational user study.\n\nargues that program emotion lingers and influences evaluation of subsequent ads, and (2) the general tendency of humans to maintain a positive mood. These assumptions preclude CAVVA from inserting ads which strongly contrast with the program valence; for example, a horror movie trailer will rarely be inserted within a sitcom program via the CAVVA framework (see Section 5.2).\n\nDifferent from  [1]  which is based on advertising theories, we expressly examine affective ad evaluation from a user study involving strongly positive and negative programs and ads. The effects of inserting similar/opposite-valence ads within emotional programs are studied to formulate ad-insertion rules, which are realized via linear integer programming to derive the affective computational advertising (ACAD) strategy. ACAD effectiveness is validated via a second user study. Figure  1  summarizes our work, which makes the following research contributions:\n\n• In contrast to postulate-based advertising strategies  [1, 2] , the ACAD formulation is derived from a user-study examining the influence of affective ad placements within a positive/negative program. This user study reveals that (a) negative ads are better recalled and receive genuine ratings when embedded at the tail of the program video, and (b) ads incongruent to the program mood are better recalled overall.\n\n• Integer linear programming is employed to select the optimal inventory ads and their insertion locations based on the user-study findings. This formulation embeds ads within programs considering (1) valence ratings of the program scenes and ads, and (2) semantic scene-ad similarities. Therefore, low-level (semantic) and high-level (emotional) scene-ad relevance are modeled in the embedding process.\n\n• A validational user study is performed to evaluate ACAD against competing methods. This study reveals (1) ACAD efficacy towards eliciting genuine ad evaluations and better ad recall, and (2) a trade-off between ad recall and viewing experience, which should serve as a design guide for future affective advertising works.",

      "text": "Ads are inherently emotional, and emotions play a critical role in effectively conveying a message to viewers regarding lifestyle choices. Emotions can mediate consumer attitudes towards advertised brands  [5] [6] [7] , and an advertising strategy that achieves favorable brand (message) evaluation can benefit content publishers and advertisers alike  [1] . Adopting the circumplex model  [3]  where emotions are characterized via the valence and arousal attributes, an affective ad dataset is proposed in  [8]  and ad affect predicted by examining the content and users. An eye tracking study  [9]  concludes that ad emotions are primarily conveyed via a few central scene characters and the visual scene design. The positive impact of emotional cues towards ad and movie scene recall is confirmed in  [10]  and  [11] .",

      "text": "As ads are interspersed within programs, the impact of program mood on ad evaluation has been studied extensively.\n\nProgram context, characterized by audio-visual and emotional program-ad (dis)similarity, impacts ad evaluation. Kamins et al.  [12]  focused on how commercial liking, and consequently, user purchase intent is affected by program mood; they observed the emotional inertia effect, i.e., happy ads are perceived favorably within a happy program while sad ads are better liked in a sad context. Broach et al.  [4]  noted that both program arousal (asl) and valence (val) impact ad perception. Specifically, positive ads are evaluated favorably within a highly arousing positive program or a mildly arousing negative program. These findings strengthen the emotional inertia theory  [13]  as lingering emotion under high asl adversely impacts focus on opposite val ads; greater cognitive resources available under low asl result in ads being viewed as more positive/negative within a sad/happy program. Only positive ads are nevertheless studied in  [4] .\n\nVaried findings exist regarding user evaluation of ads (in)congruent to the program mood. A study involving only two programs and two ads  [14]  concludes that it may be optimal to show promotional ads within positive programs, and messaging campaigns within negative programs. Other studies nevertheless point to increased recall of incongruent ads; e.g.,  [15]  notes that when one watches an arousing program, emotionally inconsistent ads tend to stimulate internal processing and are therefore better recalled. Similarly,  [16]  notes that health and safety-related messages are better recalled within a sitcom program. The positive influence of program arousal on ad recall, where users are free to watch or skip ads, is noted in  [17] . Shapiro et al.  [18]  argue that program arousal and valence independently influence ad recall. Asl impacts information processing capacity (deeper processing under low asl, shallow processing under high asl), while val influences the nature of processing (logic-based but superficial under high val, and attention to detail under low val). As information processing is key to brand evaluation and attitude, this study has design implications for computational VIVA strategies.",

      "text": "To exploit the surge in Internet video and benefit both content publishers and advertisers, computational advertising strategies have been proposed. An appraisal of the computational advertising field  [19]  emphasizes the need to account for consumer behaviors during advertising design, execution and evaluation. However, VIVA approaches typically examine user behaviors only at the evaluation stage. VideoSense  [2]  inserts ads at temporal points of low involvement (e.g., shot discontinuities), and presents ads which are audio-visually similar to the preceding video scene. The twin objectives of optimal ad selection and placement are modeled via non-linear integer programming (NLIP). While subjective evaluations are presented to validate the approach, emotional program-ad relevance is ignored in VideoSense.\n\nThe CAVVA framework  [1]  improves over VideoSense by modeling emotional relevance for program-ad matching.\n\nMatching rules are derived from  [4] , and by postulating that the embedded ads should (a) minimally perturb user emotional state and help attain/maintain a positive mood, and (b) maximally engage viewers. Consistently, low-val ads are inserted after negative-val scenes, while high-val ads are embedded between positive-val scenes. Ad selections and placements are achieved via NLIP, and CAVVA achieves superior viewing experience and ad recall than VideoSense. Rules modeling emotional inertia preclude CAVVA from embedding ads incongruent to program mood.",

      "text": "We note from the literature that (a) while a few works have measured ad-induced user behaviors, user assessments have hardly been incorporated for VIVA design; (b) even as marketing studies have examined the effects of program mood on affective ad evaluation, very few VIVA works embed ads based on program-ad emotional relevance, and (c) VIVA methods either focus on content-based or mood-sustaining advertising. Embedding ads strongly incongruent to the program mood is therefore not possible.\n\nTo address these issues, we expressly perform an exploratory user study involving both positive and negative programs and ads to understand (a) the impact of program mood on ad evaluation and recall, and (b) whether certain temporal placements are desirable for positive and negative val ads. Findings convey that optimal commercial evaluation and recall are achieved when (1) low val ads are placed towards the program tail, and (2) inserted ads are emotion-wise dissimilar but content-wise similar to the (preceding) scenes.

      "text": "Programs: For this work, we utilized the affective ad dataset and two program videos (PVs) presented in  [8] . The first PV is a sequence from the movie In Pursuit of Happiness (IPOH of drama genre), while the other PV is episode 1 from the Friends Season 2 sitcom. Both PVs comprise eight scenes and are of roughly similar lengths (mean scene length of 110±44s for IPOH vs 119±69s for Friends). These two PVs were considered as they depicted self-contained episodes, and were fairly representative of online videos 2  . One can infer from  [8]  that both PVs are sufficiently arousing. While the Friends PV is happy mood-inducing, the IPOH PV detailing the travails of a father and son is sad mood-eliciting.\n\nAds: To examine how emotional ads are perceived within an emotional program, we used 14 ads-7 high asl-high val (HAHV) and 7 high asl-low val (HALV) ads from  [8] . The HAHV ads are promotional in nature, while the HALV ads are public messages conveying the ill effects of unhealthy and hazardous lifestyle choices such as overspeeding, smoking, drug and physical abuse.\n\nVideo program sequences: As both programs and the selected ads are deemed to be sufficiently arousing, we exclusively examined the effect of program and ad valence on commercial evaluation. For the user study, four (2 HAHV + 2 HALV) of the 14 ads were randomly chosen and inserted within each PV. Consistent with the VideoSense  [2]  and CAVVA  [1]  methods, we embedded ads uniformly across each PV. As both PVs had seven scene-change points where ads could be inserted, chosen ads were placed at change-point 1, 3, 5 and 7. Cumulatively, we examined four different ad placement configurations depicted in Fig.  2 , where HV (LV) ads are placed at the head (tail), tail (head), ends (middle) and middle (ends) of the PV. These four configurations summarize meaningful placements of the 2 HV + 2 LV ads given four insertion locations (totally 4 P 4 possibilities). The ads were 0.5-1 minute long (µ = 45s, σ = 14.5s). The ad-embedded programs or video program sequences (VPSs) were ≈ 18 minutes long (µ = 18.3, σ = 0.6 minutes).",

Fig.  4  presents mean asl,val scores received by the HV and LV ads within the positive and negative programs.

HV ads elicited mean val scores of 4±0.2 and 3.9±0.3 when shown within the sad and happy PVs, indicating that HV ads were perceived as more pleasant in a sad PV. Conversely, LV ads evoked a mean val score of 1.6±0.3 and 1.7±0.1 within the IPOH and Friends PVs, implying that LV ads were seen as less unpleasant in a happy program. However, perceived differences in ad val for the happy and sad programs were insignificant as per a one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) test (F (1, 188) = 0.06, n.s).\n\nIn terms of arousal impressions (Fig.  4  (right)), LV ads evoked higher asl vis-à-vis HV ads in general.

In terms of valence, HV ads elicited higher scores when shown within a sad program, while LV ads evoked higher val scores within a happy program. That ads are better remembered in the negative program context is also known; prior studies  [20, 21]  note that negative mood induces better recall, and greater attention to detail  [18] . Greater memorability for negative stimuli  [20, 21]  explains why LV ads are better recalled irrespective of program mood. That HV ads are better recalled in the sad PV context can be attributed to the contrastive effect noted in prior studies  [15, 16] . While these trends suggest that a promotional ad may have more impact when shown in an arousing sad program, we set out to examine if certain placements are more optimal for HV and LV ads given the program mood.",

Interestingly, trends common to both HV and LV ads are apparent irrespective of program mood such as: (a) HV ads being perceived as most pleasant when placed at the VPS tail or middle, and LV ads perceived as most unpleasant when placed at the VPS tail; (b) HV ads being recalled best at the VPS middle and tail, and LV ads achieving best recall at the VPS tail, and (c) HV ads evoking maximal asl when placed in the middle of the VPS.\n\nOverall, our study confirms that both program mood and ad placement impact ad evaluation and recall. Ad placement effects convey that it may be beneficial to present (especially LV) ads later in the VPS, as the middle and tail embeddings generally achieve genuine val ratings than at the ends or the head. As our study involves presentation of ads strongly (dis)similar to the program mood, our findings suggest that users are able to evaluate ads more genuinely upon sufficient program exposure. Programs are likely to maximally attract viewers at the beginning, as they begin to engage with the content; ads presented under such high asl conditions are not adequately processed by users as per findings in  [4] . With sufficient program exposure, users tend to transit to a moderately aroused state, where both positive and negative messages are well received as conveyed by minimal VX variations across placements.\n\nGiven that the success of an advertising/awareness campaign hinges on a positive message being viewed most favorably, and conversely, a negative message being viewed most unfavorably by consumers, we hypothesize that a computational VIVA framework should generate ad embeddings that achieve the most genuine valence evaluations. Secondly, the ads should also have maximum recall rates, so that they influence purchase intent  [1] . Consistently, the ACAD strategy should result in (a) genuine ad valence evaluations, and (b) maximal ad recall. This imposes (1) LV ads to be embedded at the VPS tail where they achieve the most genuine assessments and maximum recall; HV ads are also well received in the VPS middle where they evoke high asl and achieve good recall. (2) Ads incongruent to the program mood are well recalled (Fig.  5  (right)); LV ads achieve high recall irrespective of program mood, while HV ads are better recalled in the negative program context. (3) In line with the CAVVA  [1]  and VideoSense  [2]  strategies, we hypothesize that content-based ad-scene relevance will facilitate ad recall (e.g., a kitchen commercial may be better remembered after a dinner scene).

Let {A 1 , A 2 , . . . , A P } denote the P inventory commercials from which K ads are to be chosen, so as to embed an equal number of HV and LV ads in the program. We introduce selection-cum-insertion binary variables y ij ∈ R N ×P , where y ij = 1 if ad A j follows program scene S i and y ij = 0 otherwise. Let Y be a N × P matrix containing these binary variables. As our study involves arousing programs and ads, we only consider val scores in the program scene-ad matching process. Let val Si and val Aj denote the valence evoked by scene S i and ad A j , where val Si , val Aj ∈ [0, 1]. Further, let val S ∈ R N and val a ∈ R P respectively denote the vectors denoting scene and ad valence scores. Our objective is to then to come up with the matrix Y so as to maximize the reward function RF (val S , val a sl, α, β) with trade-off parameters α, β, where\n\ns.t.

(  1 ), the α term enforces LV ads, for which (1 -val Aj ) is high, to be embedded later in the VPS. The β term encourages emotionally dissimilar (so that val Si -val Aj is large) but content-wise similar scene-ad combinations. The constraints, in order, specify that (a) only one ad can be filled per ad-slot; (b) total number of embedded ads is K and (c) the inserted ads be uniformly distributed over the VPS as in  [1, 2] , requiring one ad to be placed over every [M/K] slots, where . denotes the ceil function operator.

Output: Optimal ad-embedded VPS schedule.\n\n1. Initialize a 1-dimensional array opt_allo, which denotes the optimal ad sequence, with M zeros.\n\n2. Create a matrix C with P C K rows and K columns, whose rows consist of all possible subsets of {1, . . . , P } with K elements. Retain only those rows in C, which have a balanced sampling of HV and LV ads from the inventory. 3. For each row r in C which denotes a valid ad sampling, create a matrix L with M ! rows and M columns, where each row is a permutation of the ad choices in r. We fill these M slots with K ads, such that constraint (b) is satisfied. 4. For each row j in L, compute reward function RF (val S , val a sl, α, β) as per Equation  1 . 5. Compute max(RF ) and update opt_allo as the ad sequence corresponding to row j. 6. Repeat (  4 ) and (  5 ) for each row in C to obtain optimal opt_allo.  Algorithm 1 presents a brute-force implementation of the ACAD formulation. Input to the algorithm are scene and ad valence vectors, number of ads to be inserted, number of available ad slots and the scene-ad similarity matrix. The algorithm outputs an optimal ad-embedded VPS, denoting which ad is to be inserted at which ad-slot. The optimal sequence opt_allo of length M is initialized to zero (Step 1).\n\nStep 2 considers all K ad combinations that can be chosen from P candidates. To avoid bias, only those combinations involving an equal number of HV and LV ads are deemed valid. On choosing K ads, their optimal VPS placements need to be computed (Step 3). Here, we consider all permutations of K ads via matrix L, and retain only those placements which satisfy constraint (c). Each row of L gives a matrix Y satisfying all constraints of Equation 1. The reward function RF is then computed, and maximum RF value updated (Step 5). Steps 4 and 5 are repeated for all valid ad combinations and permutations (Step 6).\n\nAlgorithm 1 complexity is exponential in terms of the number of inventory ads and ad-slots. This is not serious in practice as in a typical VPS (e.g., Youtube-streamed videos), the number of ads and ad slots are limited in number. Efficient ways to solve binary integer programs such as branch-and-bound exist, and are easily solved by solvers like Gurobi  [22] . Another efficient way to solve Eq.(  1 ) is to relax the linear program allowing y ij to assume real values in [0,1]. Solution obtained thereof may not be optimal, and we will attempt to efficiently solve Eq.(  1 ) in future.\n\nTo compute the scene-ad similarity matrix, we employed the Places365 Resnet152 model  [23] . 40 uniformly sampled key-frames from each video scene and ad, denoted as {K s } and {K ad } are input to the Resnet and 512-D fc7 features extracted. Similarity between keyframe pairs is then computed via cosine distance, and rel(S i , A j ) denotes the mean similarity among 40 pairs. Fig.  10  presents exemplar video scene-ad keyframe pairs and their similarity scores. The Resnet model effectively captures similarities in scene structure (cafe-kitchen scenes for left-top pair) and face/body orientation, and enables selection of semantically similar-but-emotionally dissimilar ads to follow scenes in ACAD.",

      "section_name": "Cavva Vs Acad Scheduling",
      "text": "The key difference between the CAVVA  [1]  and ACAD formulations is that while CAVVA leverages emotional inertia to embed ads that minimally perturb the user's emotional state and viewing experience, ACAD seeks to insert ads strongly incongruent to the program mood to elicit genuine ad assessments and maximal recall. To examine differences in VPSs generated by these two VIVA methods, we added four scenes to both the Friends and IPOH PVs used in Sec. 3.1 so that the new Friends and IPOH programs were respectively about 24 and 18 minutes long. Eight ads-four each of HV and LV were then embedded onto these PVs (with 11 ad-slots) via the CAVVA and ACAD methods. These ads were selected from distinct inventories for the two programs (see Sec. 6). Fig.  11  presents val profiles (on a scale of 100) of the generated CAVVA and ACAD VPSs for the sad and happy programs. Scene/ad val scores input to the ACAD and CAVVA algorithms were computed as the average of the ratings provided by three experts. Smaller, solid balls denote program scenes while the larger, hollow balls represent the eight embedded ads. Scenes/ads having a val score of > 50 are deemed HV, and others LV. From the generated VPSs, we make the following observations.\n\n• Clearly, CAVVA attempts to generate smooth VPS valence profiles to maintain emotional inertia. This is especially evident for the Friends VPS (Fig.  11 (right)) where HV ads are added between scenes of similar valence so as to sustain a positive mood. For the IPOH program (Fig.  11 (left)) which contains a number of LV scenes, LV ads are added next to LV scenes, so as to enable viewers to transition to a happy emotional state through the prior scene-ad-next scene sequence.\n\n• Similar to ACAD, CAVVA was constrained to include both HV and LV ads in the generated VPS, different from its natural behavior. Under such conditions, CAVVA attempts to embed HV (LV) ads in the sad (happy) programs, so that the resulting VPS valence profile is as 'less spiky' as possible. Further, the emphasis on viewing experience results in LV ads being embedded earlier rather than later in the VPS. This behavior adversely impacts ad val assessment and recall as discussed in Sec. 6.\n\n• Contrastingly, ACAD favors the generation of VPSs with spiky val profiles consistent with our hypothesis that ads emotionally different to preceding scenes are evaluated and recalled better. The ACAD Friends and IPOH VPSs exhibit 'bumpy' val profiles. ACAD formulation also forces LV ads to be embedded at the VPS tail.\n\nRecall that the reward function RF specified by Eq.1 comprises trade-off parameters α and β. While higher α enforces the embedding of LV ads towards the VPS tail, β emphasizes on an embedding scheme where program scenes are followed by emotionally dissimilar-but-semantically similar ads. To examine the impact of this trade-off, we generated ACAD VPSs with α = β = 0.5 and α = 0, β = 1. Val profiles for the corresponding VPSs are respectively shown in red and blue in Fig.  12 . When ACAD solely focuses on semantic-plus-emotional ad-scene matching (blue curve), LV ads are also added towards the VPS head (Fig.  12  (right)). Little difference is noted between the red and blue ACAD VPSs generated for the IPOH program (Fig.  12 (left)). Nevertheless, the red curves denoting a positioning-relevance tradeoff achieve optimal ad assessments and recall as evidenced by the following validational user study.",

Different from CAVVA and  ACAD that enforce a uniform distribution of ads across the VPS (constraint (c) in Eq.1), the Trivial method works by placing multiple ads at the VPS head and middle. The CAVVA and ACAD VPSs shown in Fig.  11  were used in this study. The Trivial method randomly selects four HV plus four LV ads, following which four ads each are randomly arranged before program scenes 1 and 7 respectively. In line with the design of CAVVA and ACAD, we expected\n\n• ACAD to achieve superior ad evaluations and recall.\n\n• CAVVA to induce the optimal viewing experience.\n\n• Both these methods to perform better than Trivial embedding in the above respects.",

The VPS viewing order was counterbalanced across users to ensure that (a) all VPSs had the same number of viewings, and (b) and an equal number of users viewed the happy VPS first and vice-versa. Upon viewing each VPS scene and ad, users had to rate them for val (1-5 scale); following VPS completion they were required to (i) recall the 8 viewed ads from thumbnails from the 24 inventory ads, and (ii) rate the VPS VX. Six users cumulatively viewed two instances of each of the six VPSs, resulting in 16 ad-specific, and two VPS-specific scores for recall and VX per user.",

With respect to ad valence evaluations (first two bar plots from the left), the ACAD and Trivial methods achieved more genuine assessments than CAVVA (higher val scores for HV ads, and lower scores for LV ads). For the Friends VPS, ACAD, CAVVA and Trivial HV ad embeddings received mean val ratings of 4, 3.5 and 3.9; val scores for ACAD and CAVVA differed marginally as per a two-sample t-test (t(14) = 1.857, p = 0.093). LV ads inserted via ACAD evoked the lowest mean val score of 1.6; mean CAVVA and Trivial ad scores were 2.6 and 1.8 respectively. Distinct val scores were evoked for ACAD vs CAVVA LV ads ((t(14) = -4.058, p < 0.005)), and for CAVVA vs Trivial LV ads (t(14) = 3.237, p < 0.01).\n\nFor the sad IPOH VPS, HV ads embedded via all three VIVA methods evoked similar val scores (mean val score of 3.9, 3.8 and 3.9 for ACAD, CAVVA and Trivial), but distinct ratings were noted for LV ads (mean val score of 1.3, 2.9 and 1.7 for ACAD, CAVVA and Trivial). Distinct val ratings were noted for ACAD vs CAVVA ads (t(14) = -7.439, p < 0.0001), and slightly distinct ratings for ACAD vs Trivial (t(14) = -1.857, p < 0.096).\n\nOverall, while HV ad val ratings were unaffected by the VIVA approach, ACAD-embedded LV ads elicited genuine val scores than other methods.\n\nWith respect to ad recall, more ads were generally recalled for the IPOH VPS (mean recall of 7.4, 7.1 and 6.8 ads for ACAD, CAVVA and Trivial), but greater recall variations were noted for the Friends VPS (mean recall of 7.1, 6.1 and 6.9 ads for ACAD, CAVVA and Trivial). A slight difference in IPOH ad recall was noted for ACAD vs Trivial (t(14) = 2.017, p = 0.065), while distinct recall rates were noted for ACAD vs CAVVA (t(14) = 2.397, p < 0.05) methods in the Friends program. In terms of viewing experience, the CAVVA-generated Friends VPS received the highest scores (mean VX = 4.6) followed by Trivial (mean VX = 4.4) and ACAD (mean VX = 4.1), while the Trivial IPOH VPS (mean VX = 4.3) received higher scores than CAVVA (mean VX = 4) and ACAD (mean VX = 3.5). Overall, (a) ACAD achieves higher ad recall at the cost of VX (due to scene-ad emotional dissimilarity), and (b) when constrained to include ads strongly opposite to program mood, CAVVA may not necessarily achieve the optimal VX.",

While ACAD rules are derived from a user-study involving two short programs and a small number of ads, these rules are nevertheless generalizable, as confirmed by the validational study involving longer programs, larger number of ads and an independent set of users. The validational study also reveals a trade-off between ad recall and viewing experience, which should guide future designs. A limitation of our work is that we ignore the arousal dimension for ad evaluation, and this will be investigated in future. Other improvements as part of future work include: (a) designing a more efficient ad-embedding strategy than a brute-force approach, and (b) evaluating ACAD in real-life situations where scene and ad ratings are computed via automated methods.",
