      "text": "The Complex Emotion Recognition System (CERS) deciphers complex emotional states by examining combinations of basic emotions expressed, their interconnections, and the dynamic variations. Through the utilization of advanced algorithms, CERS provides profound insights into emotional dynamics, facilitating a nuanced understanding and customized responses. The attainment of such a level of emotional recognition in machines necessitates the knowledge distillation and the comprehension of novel concepts akin to human cognition. The development of AI systems for discerning complex emotions poses a substantial challenge with significant implications for affective computing. Furthermore, obtaining a sizable dataset for CERS proves to be a daunting task due to the intricacies involved in capturing subtle emotions, necessitating specialized methods for data collection and processing. Incorporating physiological signals such as Electrocardiogram (ECG) and Electroencephalogram (EEG) can notably enhance CERS by furnishing valuable insights into the user's emotional state, enhancing the quality of datasets, and fortifying system dependability. A comprehensive literature review was conducted in this study to assess the efficacy of machine learning, deep learning, and meta-learning approaches in both basic and complex emotion recognition utilizing EEG, ECG signals, and facial expression datasets. The chosen research papers offer perspectives on potential applications, clinical implications, and results of CERSs, with the objective of promoting their acceptance and integration into clinical decision-making processes. This study highlights research gaps and challenges in understanding CERSs, encouraging further investigation by relevant studies and organizations. Lastly, the significance of meta-learning approaches in improving CERS performance and guiding future research endeavors is underscored.",

      "text": "Affective computing is an interdisciplinary research domain that amalgamates the fundamental tenets of psychology, computer science, and cognitive science. The automatic recognition of emotions is a crucial component of affective computing, whereby the recognition of emotional states serves as the foundation for the computer's comprehension of emotions and subsequent reactions  [1] . The field of emotion recognition, which is highly appealing, has garnered significant attention from both industry and academia. Emotion recognition has numerous potential applications, including but not limited to human-computer interaction, video gaming, and continuous monitoring of infants and patients with medical conditions such as Parkinson's disease, Alzheimer's disease, depression, falls, and so on  [2] . Basic emotions are primary, universal emotional states that are widely acknowledged in various societies and typically consist of happiness, sadness, fear, anger, surprise, and disgust  [3] . These emotions are believed to be innate and have distinct facial expressions and physiological reactions  [4] . In contrast, complex emotions are more intricate and frequently entail a blend of basic emotions alongside higher cognitive operations, such as jealousy, pride, and guilt  [5] . Differing from basic emotions, complex emotions are shaped by personal encounters, social engagements, and societal standards  [6] . In fact, emotion is a complex psychological phenomenon, characterized by distinct emotional states that manifest through various physical and physiological cues. These cues can be broadly categorized into physical expressions and physiological signals. Physical expressions include facial expressions, voice intonation, gait, and body posture.Physiological signals encompass indicators such as Electroencephalogram (EEG) and Electrocardiogram (ECG) readings, Galvanic Skin Response (GSR), and other biofeedback mechanisms. Additionally, emotions can be conveyed through written text and other communication methods, acting as mediators of our internal emotional states  [1, 7, 8] . The recognition of emotions through physiological signals is an essential aspect of scrutinizing psychological states and advancing biofeedback-based applications. The advent of the metaverse concept and the integration of physiological signal trackers into smart devices have significantly advanced this area of investigation, making it both essential and intriguing for researchers. Studies have shown that changes in emotional states can directly influence physiological signals, providing a valuable means of emotion detection. The Autonomic Nervous System (ANS) and Central Nervous System (CNS) are essential in overseeing various physiological responses to emotional stimuli, like heart rate, skin conductance, and brain activity. Monitoring this regulation effectively can be done using techniques such as EEG and ECG. EEG allows for precise capture of dynamic changes in brain activity in response to emotional stimuli due to its high temporal resolution  [9, 10] . In contrast, ECG provides a reliable measurement of heart rate variability, which is closely associated with emotional arousal and autonomic regulation  [11, 12] ). These methods together offer a comprehensive understanding of the physiological basis of emotional states, enhancing the analysis of facial expressions . This understanding is vital for developing accurate and reliable methods for detecting and interpreting emotions through physiological signals  [13, 14] . The objective of the researchers is to develop emotion recognition systems that exhibit equitable levels of accuracy and responsiveness. The present difficulty in recognizing complex emotions stems from the limited array of physiological signals considered, which could obstruct a comprehensive understanding of the subtle emotional states that individuals undergo. Although physiological signals are crucial for emotion detection, the emphasis has frequently been confined to a restricted range of measurements that may fail to encapsulate the complexities of intricate emotions. Broadening the focus to include signals such as EEG, indicative of central nervous system activity, and ECG, which tracks heart activity influenced by the autonomic nervous system and sensitive to emotional intensity and stress, can offer a more comprehensive viewpoint. By merging these varied signals, it becomes feasible to reveal the detailed interactions between different physiological systems and complex emotional reactions, thereby improving both the precision and richness of emotion recognition while overcoming the constraints imposed by a limited signal emphasis  [15] . However, given that these signals are non-linear and non-stationary, it is crucial to meticulously select appropriate features to significantly enhance the accuracy of the system  [16, 17] . Another type of emotion recognition as the most effective, natural, and universal signal used by human beings to communicate their emotional states and objectives is facial expression  [18] . From 1974, 55% of messages relating to emotions and beliefs are conveyed by facial expression, 7% through spoken words, and the remaining 40% are paralinguistic  [19] . Numerous facial expression recognition (FER) approaches have been investigated in the fields of computer vision and machine learning to encode expression information from face representations. Machine learning methodologies, such as Support Vector Machine (SVM), Multilayer Perceptron (MLP), Random Forest (RF), and K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN), are frequently utilized for the purpose of determining the presence of emotional content in facial expressions  [20] . Nevertheless, the application of these methodologies extends beyond facial expressions alone, encompassing the analysis of physiological signals as well. This broader scope allows for a more comprehensive approach to the recognition of emotions. Through the integration of machine learning techniques with physiological signals (e.g., heart rate, skin conductance, brain activity) and physical cues (e.g., facial expressions), it becomes feasible to attain heightened precision and resilience in detecting emotions. This all-encompassing strategy capitalizes on the advantages offered by diverse data sources, ultimately facilitating a more profound comprehension of emotional states  [21, 22 , 23] .\n\nAnother variety of techniques that utilize deep architectures are known as deep learning methods, and they are outperforming traditional machine learning techniques in terms of accuracy and productivity. Deep Learning approaches, especially convolutional neural networks (CNN), which primarily depend on supervised learning using manually labeled data, have been inspected for facial emotion recognition  [24] . A fixed learning algorithm that is manually created is usually used to train contemporary machine learning models from scratch for a specific task. Additionally, approaches based on deep learning have demonstrated remarkable success in numerous domains. There are, however, evident disadvantages. For instance, areas possessing massive computational power and the ability to accumulate and simulate massive quantities of data have seen the most success. Many applications where data is inherently expensive or rare or where computational resources are not available are disqualified by this  [25 , 26] .\n\nIn summary, the examination of basic emotions frequently involves the analysis of data gathered under controlled conditions, posing a notable obstacle. While such controlled settings enable precise evaluation of emotional reactions, they fall short in capturing the complex and varied nature of emotions encountered in real-life situations  [27] . Real-world emotional responses are typically more complex and influenced by a myriad of factors, resulting in a fusion of basic and complex emotional states that defy easy classification. This disparity underscores a significant limitation: the datasets utilized for training deep learning models do not fully represent the emotional diversity encountered in daily life  [28] . Moreover, deep learning models, despite their effectiveness, exhibit inherent constraints within this context. They often necessitate extensive sets of labeled data, which prove challenging to acquire for complex emotions given their subjective essence and the complexities involved in accurately labeling them  [29] . This limitation hampers the models' capacity to generalize and excel in practical applications, where emotions are less predictable and more reliant on context. To tackle these hurdles, advanced deep learning methods and meta-learning strategies are under exploration. These approaches strive to enhance the flexibility and resilience of emotion recognition systems by utilizing smaller, more varied datasets and integrating contextually-aware learning mechanisms  [30] . On the other hand, most famous datasets such as MultiPie, SFEW, RaFD, JAFFE, FER2013, etc are related to basic emotions while emotions are frequently more complicated than what basic emotions can communicate  [31] . Thus complex emotions make keeping up with current emotion recognition systems difficult  [32] . For complex emotion recognition systems due to the complexity and smallness of the data set, meta-learning approaches can play a vital role. The process of distilling the experience of multiple learning episodes often covering a distribution of related tasks and using this experience to improve future learning performance is called meta-learning  [33, 34] . In recent years, few-shot learning  [35] , continual learning  [36] , label noises  [37] , and reinforcement learning  [38]  as the applications of meta-learning are commonly used in complex emotion recognition. The main goals of this paper are as follows:\n\nThis research delves into the enhancement of emotion detection through the amalgamation of facial expressions, EEG, and ECG signals using meta-learning techniques: The goal is to outperform conventional machine and deep learning approaches, thereby improving the adaptability and precision of emotion recognition systems for contextually aware real-world applications.\n\nPioneering the Study of Complex Emotion Recognition via AI: This paper marks the first in-depth investigation dedicated to understanding and developing AI systems specifically for complex emotion recognition, setting it apart from prior research that predominantly focused on basic emotions.\n\nExamining the Contrasts Between Basic and Complex Emotions: We are delving into the fundamental discrepancies between basic emotions, which are universally acknowledged and simple, and complex emotions, which are intricate and influenced by the situation.\n\nProviding Details About Complex Datasets: We offer a comprehensive overview of the datasets available for studying complex emotions, highlighting the challenges and intricacies involved in their use.\n\nAssessing Existing Research on Basic Emotion Detection: By evaluating the body of research on machine learning and deep learning techniques used for basic emotion detection, we lay the groundwork for understanding the advancements and gaps that exist.\n\nCategorizing Concepts for Complex Emotion Recognition through Meta-Learning: In this study, we categorize various approaches to complex emotion recognition based on meta-learning techniques, highlighting key methodologies that enhance the detection and understanding of emotions while expanding the capabilities of current AI technologies.",

      "text": "Complex emotions are intricate and multifaceted emotional experiences that encompass a blend of basic emotions, cognitive processes, and social influences. Unlike basic emotions, which are generally widespread, complex emotions can vary significantly among individuals and societies  [40] . Here are the primary characteristics:\n\n1. Cognitive Components: Complex emotions entail substantial cognitive assessment and understanding of situations. Individuals may have to evaluate the context, their personal beliefs and values, and the perspectives of others to fully understand and experience intricate feelings. For instance, feelings of jealousy may emerge from interpreting a situation as a threat to a valued relationship. 2. Cultural and Individual Variation: In contrast to basic emotions, which are predominantly uniform, complex emotions can differ greatly among individuals and cultures. Cultural norms, values, and personal experiences have a substantial impact on shaping the experience and expression of complex emotions. For example, the way pride is felt and exhibited may vary across cultures. 3. Extended Duration: Complex emotions typically endure longer than basic emotions and may transform over time as new information and experiences are assimilated. For example, feelings of guilt may persist as individuals contemplate their actions and their repercussions. 4. Interpersonal Functions: Complex emotions often serve a vital role in managing social connections and navigating social standards. They assist individuals in comprehending and responding to others' emotions, negotiating social hierarchies, and upholding social ties. For instance, expressions of romantic love may entail a complex interplay of emotions like affection, desire, and commitment.\n\nBasic emotions and complex emotions differ in several key aspects. Firstly, regarding duration, basic emotions are typically short-lived and immediate, whereas complex emotions tend to persist for extended periods. Secondly, in terms of cognitive involvement, basic emotions often arise automatically with minimal cognitive processing, while complex emotions require significant cognitive appraisal and interpretation of situations. Thirdly, basic emotions have clear evolutionary functions primarily related to survival, whereas complex emotions have evolved to manage more sophisticated social interactions and relationships. Finally, basic emotions are universally recognized and expressed similarly across cultures, whereas complex emotions can vary significantly based on cultural and individual differences in expression and recognition  [41, 42, 43] .",

      "section_name": "Differences Between Basic And Complex Emotions",
      "text": "To further clarify the differences between basic and complex emotions, it is crucial to explore their cognitive and social implications more deeply . Basic emotions like joy, fear, anger, sadness, disgust, and surprise are often seen as universal and innate, arising automatically in response to stimuli with little conscious thought. These emotions are believed to have developed to fulfill specific survival purposes, such as fear activating fight-or-flight reactions to possible dangers, and disgust aiding individuals in avoiding harmful substances. Studies by  [3]  and others have shown that basic emotions are expressed and understood similarly across various cultures, hinting at a common evolutionary origin.\n\nIn contrast, complex emotions such as guilt, shame, envy, pride, and love involve more intricate cognitive processes, often requiring self-reflection, comparison with others, and an understanding of societal norms and expectations. These emotions are not only enduring but also dependent on context, influenced by personal encounters, cultural upbringing, and the particular social setting. For example, feeling shame involves evaluating one's actions in relation to societal standards and anticipating others' judgments, which can differ significantly among cultures  [44, 45] . Research indicates that while the fundamental elements of these emotions might be universal, their expression, interpretation, and importance are molded by cultural context and individual distinctions  [46] . Furthermore, complex emotions frequently result from combinations or interactions of basic emotions  [47]  and are more likely to involve mixed sentiments or uncertainty. For instance, jealousy could blend fear (of losing a relationship) with anger (towards a perceived rival) and sadness (due to feeling unappreciated). This complex interplay of emotions showcases the sophisticated cognitive processes that underlie complex emotions, making them more challenging to investigate and comprehend compared to basic emotions  [48] . Additionally, the influence of language in expressing and shaping complex emotions should not be underestimated; different societies possess specific terms and ideas that capture nuanced emotional states, emphasizing further the diversity in how these emotions are felt and conveyed  [49] . Basic emotions and complex emotions differ in several key aspects. Firstly, regarding duration, basic emotions are typically short-lived and immediate, whereas complex emotions tend to persist for extended periods. Secondly, in terms of cognitive involvement, basic emotions often arise automatically with minimal cognitive processing, while complex emotions require significant cognitive appraisal and interpretation of situations. Thirdly, basic emotions have clear evolutionary functions primarily related to survival, whereas complex emotions have evolved to manage more sophisticated social interactions and relationships. Finally, basic emotions are universally recognized and expressed similarly across cultures, whereas complex emotions can vary significantly based on cultural and individual differences in expression and recognition  [50, 51, 52, 53, 54] .",

Despite psychologists' various attempts to classify emotions in fields like neuroscience, philosophy, and computer science, there is no universally agreed-upon model of emotions. However, the two main types of emotion models commonly utilized are the discrete (or categorical) emotion model and the dimensional (or continuous) emotion model  [55] .\n\nIn the discrete emotion modelas which illustrated by the wheel of emotions depicted in  SAM uses images of SAMmanikins to evaluate the static level of a dimension at a specific moment, while Feeltrace monitors emotional data continuously over time  [56] . Both models emphasize different facets of human emotion and provide insights into how emotions are perceived and understood by the human mind. The discrete model sorts emotions into categories with distinct labels, while the dimensional model captures the intricacy and variability of emotional states through continuous assessment.\n\nTogether, these models contribute to a thorough comprehension of genuine emotional states and are crucial in the realm of affective computing.",

These datasets mainly gather facial expression data rather than physiological signals. Due to their subtle features, it is challenging to analyze the motion track and characteristics of micro-expressions. Consequently, generating compound micro-expression images presents numerous obstacles and limitations. The data in these datasets is captured using high-speed cameras that record slight facial movements at a high frame rate, typically ranging from 100 to 200 frames per second, enabling the detection of micro-expressions lasting between 1/25th and 1/5th of a second. Participants in these datasets engage in various tasks or are exposed to specific stimuli to evoke spontaneous emotional reactions, which are then documented  [59 ,60, 61, 62, 63] . The number of participants varies among the datasets. For example, the CASME II dataset contains recordings from 26 individuals, while the SAMM dataset includes data from 32 subjects. The exact number of participants in the CMED may differ, but it usually encompasses a diverse group to ensure a wide array of facial expressions and emotions. These datasets cover a range of both basic and complex emotions.

It delves into the intricacies of preparing facial images to derive significant features that represent various emotional states. Major challenges encompass managing fluctuations in lighting conditions, facial angles, and the range of facial expressions. Furthermore, it highlights the necessity for sophisticated techniques in feature extraction to effectively capture the subtleties of intricate emotions  [81] .\n\nInitial stages involve detecting and aligning faces to ensure consistent positioning and orientation of facial features in images. Following face detection, normalization methods are utilized to counteract lighting variations by adjusting brightness, contrast, and color balance for standardization. Next, noise reduction techniques like Gaussian blurring or median filtering are applied to minimize unwanted image artifacts that could disrupt emotional cue recognition. Feature extraction is then carried out to capture important facial attributes crucial for emotion recognition, including identifying facial landmarks and extracting texture descriptors from facial regions. Given that feature vectors often consist of intricate data, dimensionality reduction techniques like Principal Component Analysis (PCA) or t-Distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding (t-SNE) are applied to decrease computational complexity and prevent overfitting. Through these preprocessing steps, facial expression recognition systems can enhance their accuracy, resilience, and ability to generalize in emotion classification tasks. This thorough preprocessing process ensures that the recognition system is well-prepared to provide consistent and precise results across various input images, enabling applications in affective computing, humancomputer interaction, and physical research  [82, 83] .",

It will encompass the preprocessing procedures needed to cleanse and filter the physiological signals, extract relevant features, and alleviate artifacts to precisely capture the underlying emotional states. Challenges in this field may involve noise reduction, artifact elimination, feature extraction from intricate physiological signals, and ensuring the dependability and precision of the processed data for emotion recognition  [84] .\n\nThe preprocessing workflow involves several essential steps tailored to optimize the EEG and ECG signals for effective analysis. Firstly, artifact removal is imperative to eliminate noise and unwanted interference from the signals. EEG signals, for instance, are susceptible to various artifacts like eye blinks, muscle movements, and environmental electrical noise, while ECG signals can be affected by muscle activity and movement artifacts. Techniques such as independent component analysis (ICA) and adaptive filtering are commonly used to mitigate these artifacts, ensuring that the extracted signals accurately represent the underlying neural and cardiac activity. Following artifact removal, signal segmentation is performed to divide the continuous EEG and ECG recordings into shorter, temporally meaningful epochs, often aligned with specific stimuli or events that elicit emotional responses. This segmentation allows for the analysis of emotion-related signal patterns within defined time windows. After segmentation, feature extraction is conducted to capture relevant characteristics from the EEG and ECG signals indicative of different emotional states. For EEG signals, features may include spectral power, coherence, and asymmetry in specific frequency bands, while ECG features may encompass heart rate variability (HRV), amplitude variations, and timing intervals such as RR intervals. Dimensionality reduction techniques are then used to minimize the complexity of the feature space while keeping important information, such as principal component analysis (PCA) and wavelet processing. By implementing these preprocessing steps, EEG and ECGbased emotion recognition systems can significantly improve their accuracy, robustness, and generalization capabilities, allowing for the development of more reliable and versatile emotion classification models for use in affective computing, human-computer interaction, and psychological research  [85, 86, 87] .",

Meta-learning comprises various methodologies: optimization-based, model-based, and metric-learning-based techniques  [98] .\n\nOptimization-based techniques, including Model-Agnostic Meta-Learning (MAML), Reptile, and Almost No Inner Loop (ANIL), focus on identifying optimal initialization parameters that allow models to quickly converge on new tasks with minimal modifications. These techniques offer flexibility and adaptability across a variety of emotion recognition scenarios by effectively learning from a handful of examples  [99, 100]  .\n\nModel-based techniques, such as recurrent and convolutional neural networks, integrate meta-learning principles directly into their architecture.

In the field of affective computing for complex emotion recognition, employing noisy labels addresses several challenges inherent in interpreting facial expressions. Concerning the subjective nature of human emotions, different annotators frequently provide diverse interpretations, leading to problems in labeling. Noisy labels help manage this ambiguity allowing models to learn from a distribution of possible labels instead of a single, potentially erroneous one, thereby fostering more robust representations. Moreover, Fig  9  demonstrates that integrating label noise during training also enhances model robustness by leveraging techniques like label distribution learning, which improves generalization and mitigates the impact of incorrect labels. This approach is particularly beneficial for handling the complexity of real-world facial expressions, which often involve mixtures of basic emotions. Noisy labels mirror this variability and help models distinguish subtle emotional nuances. Additionally, methods like Face-Specific Label Distribution Learning (FSLDL) create augmented training samples with label distributions, broadening the range of expressions and viewpoints captured, thus enhancing the model's ability to generalize to new data. To prevent overfitting to noisy samples, techniques such as rank regularization and discriminative loss functions are employed, ensuring that the model focuses on more reliable samples and maintains overall performance.

One major issue is handling unlabeled data, as complex emotions are often not explicitly labeled in datasets. RL, particularly through Deep Q-Networks (DQN), can learn from the environment via rewards and penalties, thus improving performance without the need for labeled data. Another challenge is identifying emotionally relevant intervals within data streams, such as video or physiological signals. RL-based segmentation dynamically learns to highlight these intervals, refining its strategy over time through rewards for accurate emotion recognition. Additionally, emotional states change rapidly, posing a challenge for static models. RL's adaptive learning allows for real-time updates in understanding and segmentation, making the system robust and effective in capturing dynamic emotional states in real-world scenarios. By addressing these challenges, RL significantly enhances the performance and reliability of complex emotion recognition systems in affective computing. Another significant advantage of using RL for complex emotion recognition is its ability to learn from sparse and unlabeled data. By focusing on key segments with significant emotional information, the RL-based segmentation module ensures that the decision module receives the most relevant data, leading to better recognition accuracy. This method is particularly effective for complex emotions, which are often subtle and not easily captured through simple observation. The RL approach allows the system to adapt and improve over time, refining its ability to detect and interpret complex emotional states. There is a step-by-step progression of emotions in interactions, which is comparable to how the action selected in reinforcement learning depends on the emotional state at that moment and the sequence of state transitions. The selected activity, representing the target's recognition results and the current emotional state, also impacts the reward function. This reinforcement learning module is essential for identifying the target emotion using characteristics of the appropriate emotion pair. By effectively managing unlabeled data, identifying key emotional intervals, integrating multimodal data, and improving recognition accuracy through iterative optimization, RL-based systems offer a comprehensive solution to the complexities of emotion recognition. The dynamic and adaptive nature of RL allows these systems to respond to rapid changes in emotional states, ensuring robust performance in real-world scenarios. The step-by-step progression and adaptation in RL mirror the evolving nature of human emotions, making it a powerful tool in affective computing. Reinforcement learning's ability to continuously improve through experience and feedback makes it particularly suited for the nuanced task of complex emotion recognition, providing a reliable and effective approach to understanding human emotions in various contexts which is highlighted in Fig  10 .

      "text": "In this section, we aim to review some studies related to AI approaches corresponding to the recognition of emotion by considering facial expressions, ECG, and EEG signals.\n\nThe construction of an artificial intelligence (AI) system that can recognize emotions from facial expressions. Jaiswal et al.  [121]  developed an AI system for emotion detection using deep learning, specifically a convolutional neural network (CNN) architecture. This model focuses on three main processes: face detection, feature extraction, and emotion classification. CNN's ability to automatically extract features and classify emotions showcases significant accuracy, achieving 98.65% on the JAFFE dataset and 70.14% on the FERC-2013 dataset. Key advantages of this model include high accuracy, the efficacy of deep learning in reducing manual feature extraction, and scalability. However, the model's limitations are its dependency on the quality and diversity of datasets, substantial computational requirements, and potential generalization issues across different populations and lighting conditions. Overall, while the CNN-based model marks a significant improvement over traditional methods, further enhancements are needed for broader application and real-world deployment.\n\nIn  [122] , a novel multi-modal input approach that uses color, depth, and thermal recording videos to estimate dimensional emotion states was described. Based on attention-boosted feature volumes, the proposed networks, dubbed multi-modal recurrent attention networks (MRAN), robustly distinguish facial expressions by learning spatiotemporal attention volumes. Utilizing the depth and heat sequences as guide priors, a selective focus on emotional discriminative regions on the color sequence was applied. Additionally, a brand-new multi-modal facial expression recognition benchmark called multi-modal arousal-valence facial expression recognition (MAVFER) comprised continuous arousal-valence scores matching to films of color, depth, and thermal recording. The outcomes of the experiments demonstrate that the approach was capable of producing state-of-the-art outcomes in color recording datasets for dimensional facial emotion recognition.\n\nZhang et al  [123]  studied the implementation of several deep learning models, such as long short-term memory (LSTM), convolutional neural networks (CNN), deep neural networks (DNN), and a hybrid model of CNN and LSTM (CNN-LSTM), to the subject of their research of EEG-based emotion recognition. The popular DEAP dataset was applied for evaluation. According to the experimental results, the CNN and CNN-LSTM models performed well in the categorization of EEG-based emotions, with accurate raw data extraction rates of 90.12 and 94.17%, respectively.\n\nBazgir et al  [124]  worked on the Deap dataset to build an AI system for the recognition of emotion based on electroencephalography (EEG) signals. Operating the discrete wavelet transform (DWT), EEG signals were divided into the gamma, beta, alpha, and theta frequency bands. Spectral features were then retrieved from each frequency band. To make the features mutually uncorrelated, principle component analysis (PCA) was used for the retrieved features while maintaining the same dimensionality as a transform. Emotional states were categorized by support vector machines (SVM), artificial neural networks (ANN), and k-nearest neighbors (KNN). With extracted features from ten EEG channels, the cross-validated SVM with radial basis function (RBF) kernel performs with 91.3% accuracy for arousal and 91.1% accuracy for valence in the beta frequency range.\n\nThe purpose of Sun and Lin's study  [125]  was to employ ECG signals to identify emotions. The data represented Four different emotions: happy, thrilling, tranquil, and tense. A finite impulse filter is then used to de-noise the raw data. To improve the accuracy of emotion recognition, The Discrete Cosine Transform (DCT) to extract characteristics from the collected data was applied. Support Vector Machine (SVM), Random Forest, and K-NN classifiers are investigated. The optimal parameters for the SVM classifier are found using the Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) approach. The comparison of these classification techniques' findings shows that the SVM methodology recognizes emotions more accurately, which is useful in practical settings.\n\nNguyen et al  [126]  provided a new transfer learning approach utilizing PathNet to explore knowledge accumulation within a dataset and transfer insights from one emotion dataset to enhance overall performance to solve the generalization problem of developed deep learning models corresponding to a shortage of extensive emotion datasets. The proposed system by passing different series of investigations on SAVEE and eNTERFACE datasets enhances emotion recognition performance according to experimental results, outperforming recent stateof-the-art methods that employ fine-tuning or pre-trained approaches. The highest recognition accuracy that the proposed system could obtain was 93.75% on SAVEE and 87.5% on eNTERFACE.\n\nAlbraikan et al  [127]  worked on the E4, and MAHNOB datasets to boost the classifier's accuracy rate by utilizing peripheral physiological signals. A hybrid sensor fusion method based on a stacking model was presented which enabled the simultaneous embedding of data from several sensors and emotion models within a model that was independent of the user. As a fundamental model for classifying emotions, WMD-DTW, a weighted multidimensional DTW, and the k-nearest neighbors algorithm were employed. On top of the two base models, a high-level classifier was learned using the ensemble methods. Applying a meta-learning methodology, were able to demonstrate the ensemble method performs more effectively than any particular method. The result showed recognizing valence and arousal emotions achieved 94.0% and 93.6% employing the MAHNOB dataset.\n\nTable  2  provides an extensive overview of the techniques, results, advantages, and disadvantages of the featured study, along with additional pertinent research. Its aim is to assist in conducting a meticulous comparison, in order to clarify the pros and cons associated with each study.

Data augmentation, knowledge extraction, and a revolutionary Predictive Sorting Memory Replay to prevent catastrophic forgetting and enhance performance with fewer training samples were used. A considerable association between the activations of features in basic expressions and those in compound expressions was discovered by comparing the Grad-CAM heat maps of images of basic expressions with those of compound expressions. Continual learning outperforms non-continual learning methods in complicated face expression recognition, outperforming non-continual learning methods' state-of-the-art by 13.95%. The overall accuracy in new classes with 74.28% had demonstrated that continual learning for complex facial expression recognition played an essential role. This study is motivated by human cognition and learning patterns and it is the first to use few-shot learning for complex facial expression identification, attaining the stateof-the-art with 100% accuracy while only requiring one training sample for each expression class.\n\nTo showcasing significant improvements and practical applications in the domain of complex emotion recognition systems, Bhosale et al.  [130]  proposed a few-shot adaptation method from Electroencephalography (EEG) signals to address the lengthy calibration phase required by traditional Brain-Computer Interfaces (BCIs), hindering an optimal plug-and-play experience. Their model employed meta-learning to generalize well to new individuals with limited data, utilizing a few-shot learning framework trained on a small number of samples from previously unseen subjects, hence avoiding the need for retraining. Tested on the DEAP database with EEG recordings from 32 subjects watching music videos followed by emotion ratings, their method significantly improved emotion classification accuracy in terms of valence and arousal using only 20 reference samples from new subjects. Key contributions included quantifying the minimum calibration samples needed and introducing a 3-D convolutional recurrent embedding model to capture temporal relationships from spatially convolved EEG features. They explored various sampling strategies for support sets, finding that a combination of subject-dependent and subjectindependent samples yielded competitive performance. In zero calibration scenarios, the model trained with subject-independent samples outperformed the supervised baseline. This system reduced the calibration burden and enhanced classification accuracy, advancing cross-subject EEG emotion recognition models and paving the way for more user-friendly and effective BCI applications.\n\nBy improving accuracy and robustness in recognizing micro-expressions for complex emotion recognition systems, a dual-branch meta-auxiliary learning method called LightmanNet for micro-expression recognition (MER) to address the challenges of limited data, subtle features, and individual differences in emotion detection was conducted by Wang et al  [102] . LightmanNet utilizes a bi-level optimization process: in the first level, it learns task-specific MER knowledge through two branches. The primary branch focuses on learning MER features via primary MER tasks, while the auxiliary branch guides the model by aligning micro-expressions with macroexpressions, leveraging their spatial and temporal similarities. This dual-branch approach ensures the model learns meaningful features and avoids noise. In the second level, the model refines the task-specific knowledge, enhancing its generalization and efficiency. The method allows for quick acquisition of discriminative and generalizable MER knowledge from limited data. Extensive experiments demonstrated that LightmanNet significantly outperformed traditional, deep-learning, and meta-learning-based MER methods. The key contributions include addressing the data-level, feature-level, and decision-making-level challenges in MER, proposing a novel dual-branch meta-auxiliary learning method to improve model generalization and efficiency, and demonstrating its superior robustness and effectiveness.

By generating relation scores between the query image and the sparse samples of each new class, SCRNet establishes a distance metric based on deep information abstracted by convolutional neural networks and predicts an emotion category for a query image. Six basic emotion categories such as Happiness, Surprise, Sadness, Fear, Disgust, and Anger for facial expression detection to more intricate and compound emotions had developed.

In classification problems  [96, 131] , classifiers are frequently evaluated using a confusion matrix-based technique, as shown in Fig  11  . This approach provides five critical classification metrics for performance comparison; as a consequence, these criteria for the evaluation of models, including precision, recall, accuracy, specificity, and F1-score, have been constructed. Precision demonstrates the proportion of accurately detected instances of a certain emotion, emphasizing the system's ability to identify emotional states. In contrast, recall evaluates the ability of the system to detect all instances of a specific emotion in the dataset, assuring sensitivity to emotional expressions. Accuracy provides a wide overview of categorization correctness, considering true positives, true negatives, false positives, and false negatives. Specificity, represented by the True Negative (TN) rate, assesses the system's accuracy in correctly identifying instances devoid of specific emotions, crucial for distinguishing genuine emotional expressions from non-emotional states. However, in instances with unbalanced data, accuracy alone may not be sufficient, emphasizing the significance of prioritizing recall and precision for a nuanced assessment. By emphasizing recall and precision, ERS developers can better evaluate system performance, particularly in handling imbalanced datasets, leading to continuous refinement and optimization efforts in the pursuit of more accurate and reliable emotion recognition systems  [132, 133, 134] .

      "text": "In this study, we have delved into the effectiveness of the CERS in identifying human emotions within intricate tasks. Our research has showcased the success of CERS through different case studies, emphasizing its wide range of potential applications. This study marks a pioneering endeavor in this field, with no prior similar studies documented thus far. While previous research has focused on basic emotion recognition systems centered on facial expressions or physiological signals like EEG and ECG, our work goes beyond these methods to capture emotions within complex tasks. The case studies presented highlight the adaptability of CERS, suggesting its potential use in various sectors such as healthcare, education, and human-computer interaction. Our results indicate that even with partial implementation, CERS shows promising abilities in identifying underlying emotions linked to complex tasks. By combining data from multiple sensors, CERS can accurately deduce specific emotions, thereby improving human-computer interaction in intelligent systems. This study sets the foundation for future research aimed at improving the CERS using meta-learning techniques including incorporating advanced techniques such as few-shot learning and constant learning to allow for rapid adaptation and continuous development of emotion recognition across varied situations. Machine learning model optimization, particularly deep learning and ensemble approaches, has the potential to improve emotion recognition accuracy and robustness. Focusing on real-time emotion identification capabilities inside CERS, employing meta-learning approaches for quick adaptation to changing settings, and individualized emotion recognition models tailored to specific users' preferences are also critical. Furthermore, taking into account the ethical and societal implications of CERS deployment and defining responsible rules for its usage, including insights from meta-learning methodologies to assure fairness and transparency, is critical for the technology's ethical progress.",
