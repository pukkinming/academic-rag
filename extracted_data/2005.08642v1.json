In this paper, we have proposed a binary variant of Atom Search Optimization (ASO) and its hybrid with Simulated Annealing called ASO-SA techniques for FS. In order to map the real values used by ASO to the binary domain of FS, we have used two different transfer functions: S-shaped and V-shaped. We have hybridized this technique with a local search technique called, SA We have applied the proposed feature selection methods on 25 datasets from 4 different categories: UCI, Handwritten digit recognition, Text/non-text separation, and Facial emotion recognition. We have used 3 different classifiers (K-Nearest Neighbor, Multi-Layer Perceptron and Random Forest) for evaluating the strength of the selected featured by the binary ASO, ASO-SA and compared the results with ≥4 recent wrapper-based algorithms. The experimental results confirm the superiority of the proposed method both in terms of classification accuracy and number of selected features.",

      "text": "In recent times, due to the wide availability of data and the crucial need to extract useful information from these data, in information industry data mining is one of the fastest growing research topics (M.  Mafarja et al., 2018) . Data mining is an integral part of knowledge discovery (M. M.  Mafarja & Mirjalili, 2017) , which consists of data pre-processing, data mining, pattern evaluation and knowledge representation. The pre-processing step has a huge impact on the data mining technique. Now, all the extracted features are not useful for data mining, as some of those are irrelevant or redundant  (Ghaemi & Feizi-Derakhshi, 2016) , which affects the data mining tasks (e.g., classification). Not only that these irrelevant or redundant features become burden in process of knowledge discovery, but also they result in increased computational complexity, incomprehensibility of the results and augmented storage requirement  (Ghaemi & Feizi-Derakhshi, 2016) . Here comes the importance of feature selection (FS) techniques. FS  (Anaraki & Usefi, 2019)  is a pre-processing step that helps in dimensionality reduction of the dataset being processed by eliminating the irrelevant/redundant features. FS is a proper subset of feature weighting  (Wettschereck, Aha, & Mohri, 1997) , in which a feature is assigned a weight according to their importance in solving a problem using some machine learning approach. FS is subset of feature weighting, where weights are either '1' or '0', i.e., a feature is either selected or rejected.\n\nCoarsely, the main steps of FS  (DASH & LIU, 1997)  are: subset generation, subset evaluation, setting end criteria and validation. Based upon the subset evaluation criteria, FS methods can be divided in two types: filter and wrapper. Wrapper methods use a learning algorithm to measure the worth of a feature subset (M.  Ghosh, Adhikary, et al., 2019) . In filter methods, no learning algorithm is used, instead, the importance of a feature or a subset of features is determined based on some specific characteristics of the dataset under consideration (M.  Ghosh, Adhikary, et al., 2019) .\n\nThe subset generation is basically a searching technique that selects a subset from the original set using complete, random or heuristic search. In complete search, all possible subsets are evaluated to find the best one. Though this process guarantees the finding of best feature subset, for n number of features we need to evaluate 2 n subsets. Obviously the computational complexity of this method is too high, thus making a complete search non-feasible option (M.  Ghosh, Adhikary, et al., 2019) . Random search is another strategy for generating feature subset (M.  Mafarja et al., 2018) , but in worst case it may perform an exhaustive search. Heuristic search is another alternative to the mentioned search strategies. It can also be called depth first search guided by heuristics (M.  Mafarja et al., 2018) . Various meta-heuristics such as Genetic Algorithm  (Yang & Honavar, 1998) , Ant Colony Optimization (ACO)  (Dorigo & Di Caro, n.d.) , Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO)  (Lee, Soak, Oh, Pedrycz, & Jeon, 2008) , Dragonfly Algorithm (M.  Mafarja, Heidari, Faris, Mirjalili, & Aljarah, 2020) , Grasshopper Optimization Algorithm (GOA)  (Saremi, Mirjalili, & Lewis, 2017) , Forest Optimization Algorithm  (Ghaemi & Feizi-Derakhshi, 2016) , Grey Wolf Optimizer (GWO)  (Emary, Zawbaa, Grosan, & Hassenian, 2015) , etc. have shown quite good results in tackling FS problems. Meta-heuristic algorithms can be classified mainly in two categories (M.  Mafarja et al., 2018) : single solution and population based algorithms. In single solution-based methods, one state is manipulated and transformed throughout the search process. Methods in this category show more exploitative nature, which implies focusing on the space around a possible solution. In populationbased algorithms, a set of solutions is evolved during the search process. These methods are more explorative in nature, which means looking around different regions of the space. While designing a meta-heuristic algorithm, both of these criteria must be considered. High exploitation may result in the optimizer being trapped in local optima whereas high exploration may lead to selection of outliers.\n\nAtom Search Optimization (ASO)  (Zhao, Wang, & Zhang, 2019b)  is the newest addition to the domain of meta-heuristic algorithms. ASO tries to mimic the movement of atoms according to Lennard-Jones potential  (Stone, 2013)  developed among interacting atoms. In recent past, the algorithm has gained popularity as a nature-inspired optimization algorithm and has been applied to solve various interesting optimization problems like hydro-geologic parameter estimation  (Zhao et al., 2019b) , dispersion coefficient estimation  (Zhao, Wang, & Zhang, 2019a)  etc. But to the best of our knowledge, the optimization procedure used in ASO has not ever been applied to solve any FS problems. But the very characteristics of ASO makes it a suitable choice for FS problems. This has motivated us to develop the version of ASO which is applicable to FS. In addition, to improve the exploitation ability of the basic ASO, we have combined a popular local search technique called Simulated Annealing (SA) with the existing ASO version. Finally, to prove the robustness and applicability of ASO in the FS domain, we have made a case study by applying our ASO-SA based FS model over varied datasets which include UCI, text/non-text classification, digit recognition and facial emotion recognition.\n\nIn this paper, we have presented our experimental findings regarding the newly developed FS version of ASO. Our primary contributions to this paper are listed below:\n\n• Development of the FS version of ASO for the first time.\n\n• Hybridization of ASO with SA denoted by ASO-SA to improve exploitation ability of basic ASO.\n\n• A detailed case study to show the usefulness of ASO and ASO-SA in the FS domain by applying them over UCI, text/non-text classification, digit recognition and facial emotion recognition datasets.\n\nThe rest of the paper is organized as follows: Section 2 provides a brief overview of the other works done by researchers in the domain of FS. Section 3 describes the proposed work in detail. The results and findings of our case study are presented in section 4. Section 5 concludes the paper and provides the scope of future works.",

      "text": "Over the years, researchers have found that simple natural phenomena have gifted abilities to provide solutions to many hard optimization problems. Motivated from these findings, people have implemented and used various nature and bio-inspired meta-heuristic algorithms to solve the optimization problems. One such highly addressed optimization problem is FS where researchers have proposed many algorithms to search for a near-optimal subset of features within a limited time span.\n\nOne of the most fundamental optimization algorithms applied to solve FS problems is Genetic Algorithm (GA). After its inception as an optimization algorithm  (Holland, 1992) , GA has been used to solve multiple optimization problems like gene selection in cancer classification  (Alba, Garcia-Nieto, Jourdan, & Talbi, 2007) , stock market data mining optimization  (Lin, Cao, Wang, & Zhang, 2004) , component designs  (Husbands, Jermy, McIlhagga, & Ives, 1996)  etc. A more comprehensive set of applications of GA can be found in  (Tang, Man, Kwong, & He, 1996) . After the introduction of GA to the domain of FS by  Leardi et al. in (Leardi, 1996) , it has been used extensively to solve various FS problems  (Basiri & Nemati, 2009; De Stefano, Fontanella, Marrocco, & Di Freca, 2014; Il-Seok Oh, Jin-Seon Lee, & Byung-Ro Moon, 2004; Malakar, Ghosh, Bhowmik, Sarkar, & Nasipuri, 2019; Nemati, Ehsan, Ghasem-aghaee, & Hosseinzadeh, 2009; Prasad, Biswas, & Jain, 2010) . GA uses the concepts of chromosome crossover and mutation to achieve a balance in exploration and exploitation of the search space. Inspired from the success of GA in the FS domain, researchers have made efforts to adapt other popular metaheuristic optimization algorithms to FS. As a result, some highly used optimization algorithms like PSO  (Chen, Zhou, & Yuan, 2019; C. Huang & Dun, 2008; Wang, Yang, Teng, Xia, & Jensen, 2007; Xue, Zhang, & Browne, 2012) , ACO  (Basiri & Nemati, 2009; Forsati, Moayedikia, Jensen, Shamsfard, & Meybodi, 2014; C. L. Huang, 2009; Kabir, Shahjahan, & Murase, 2012; Kashef & Nezamabadi-pour, 2015) , GSA  (Papa et al., 2011; E. Rashedi & Nezamabadi-Pour, 2014; Esmat Rashedi & Nezamabadi-pour, 2012; Esmat Rashedi, Nezamabadi-Pour, & Saryazdi, 2010b)  has been re-introduced to the research community with their binary versions to solve FS problems. These binary versions have performed well in the domain of FS and have become quite famous in the research community. But each such algorithm suffers from a fundamental problem i.e. finding a proper trade-off for exploration and exploitation. The next generation of researchers have made efforts to solve this problem by hybridizing various algorithms together  (Anter, Azar, & Fouad, 2019; Badawi, Khalil, & Alsmadi, 2013; Trivedi, Srivastava, Mishra, Shukla, & Tiwari, 2018) . Although some algorithms have performed better than the others to find a proper balance between exploitation and exploration, the problem still remained. In the search of a solution to this problem, researchers have started to exploit the searching behaviour of other natural objects and tried to mimic them which resulted in the introduction of some recently proposed metaheuristic algorithms in FS like Whale Optimization Algorithm (WOA)  (Hussien, Hassanien, Houssein, Bhattacharyya, & Amin, 2019; M. M. Mafarja & Mirjalili, 2017; Sharawi, Zawbaa, & Emary, 2017) ,  GWO (Abdel-Basset, El-Shahat, El-henawy, de Albuquerque, & Mirjalili, 2020; Emary, Zawbaa, & Hassanien, 2016) , GOA (M.  Mafarja et al., 2019) , Artificial Bee Colony (ABC)  (Zhang, Cheng, Shi, Gong, & Zhao, 2019) , Dragonfly algorithm (M. M.  Mafarja, Eleyan, Jaber, Hammouri, & Mirjalili, 2017)  etc. The applicability of these algorithms in the FS domain have inspired us to develop a binary version of a recently proposed optimization technique named ASO and to apply it over various datasets.  Zhao et al. proposed  the ASO model in  (Zhao et al., 2019a)  to estimate dispersion coefficient in ground water. Through the proposed model, the authors have tried to mimic the characteristics of atomic motion. According to the concepts of dynamics of atoms, Lennard-Jones potential and bondlength potential among atoms produce the interaction forces among atoms which guides their movements. Using these concepts, the ASO model has been developed to provide solution to optimization problems. The authors have applied ASO for dispersion coefficient estimation of ground water. The experimental outcomes prove that ASO is able to outperform other popular optimization approaches like PSO, GSA and Bacterial Foraging Optimization (BFO)  (Passino, 2010) . Zhao et al. have used the same procedure again to solve hydrogeological parameter estimation problem in  (Zhao et al., 2019b) . In this paper, they have provided the experimental outcomes of the application of ASO over 37 benchmark unimodal, multimodal, hybrid, low-dimensional and composite functions. The results obtained by ASO have been tallied against PSO, GA, SA, GSA and Wind Driven Optimization (WDO)  (Bayraktar, Komurcu, Bossard, & Werner, 2013) . The excellent results of ASO clearly establishes its applicability in the optimization domain. But ASO has never been used to solve FS problems. The searching prowess of ASO has motivated us to apply it to search for important feature subsets from feature sets in various contexts. That is why we have developed a binary version of ASO with the help of transformation functions to map real values in ASO to binary values. In addition, to prove the robustness of this version of ASO, we have applied it over datasets and features with different backgrounds.",

So the Euclidian distance between x i and\n\nx j is given by r ij = ‖x j -x i ‖ = √ (x i1 -x j1 ) 2 + (x i2 -x j2 ) 2 + ⋯ + (x in -x jn ) 2 . The terms ( Figure  1 : LJ potential curve with attraction and repulsion region. In the attractive zone, the attraction force gradually decreases to zero as the distance between the atoms increases. In the repulsive zone, the repulsive force rapidly increases as the distance decreases. At the equilibrium distance (r=1.2σ), the interaction force between the atoms is zero. At that point, the minimum bonding potential energy of the atoms is reached.\n\nThe interaction force working on i th atom from j th atom in the d th dimension at the t th time is given by  (Zhao et al., 2019a) :\n\nAnd\n\nThe atom keeps a relative distance (from each other) that varies in a certain range all the time due to attraction or repulsion, and the change of amplitude in repulsion relative to equilibrium distance is much greater than that in attraction.

This justifies the fact that FS can be considered a multi-objective problem that aims to find smallest subset with best accuracy. The fitness function is defined as:\n\n|X| and |D| represent respectively number of selected features and total number of features, ε is the classification error rate of the corresponding classifier and ωϵ[0,1] is the weight.\n\nSince in FS problem the knowledge representation is binary in nature, the atoms can move by flipping various numbers of bits. So, we need to modify the position updating process. In continuous version of ASO, the atoms can move around the search space utilizing the position vectors within the continuous real domain. So, position can be easily updated by adding velocity using equation (  17 ). But in binary space, since we deal with only 0 and 1, the same formula to update position will not work. So, we need a way to map velocity and position to fit into binary positions. Now, according to  (Kennedy & Eberhart, 1997) , we can change the position of an atom based on the probability of velocity of that atom. To do this, a transfer function is required to map velocity values to probability values. After converting velocity values to probability values, we can update the position vectors using the corresponding probability of velocities as:\n\nwhere, T is the transfer function. For this work we have set rand = 0.5. Actually, transfer functions force atoms to move in a binary space  (Mirjalili & Lewis, 2013) . According to (Esmat Rashedi, Nezamabadi-Pour, & Saryazdi, 2010a), to select a transfer function for mapping velocity values to probability values some points must be maintained:\n\n1. Since transfer functions indicate probability, the range must be [0,1] 2. For a large absolute value of the velocity, transfer function should output high probability for position change (0 to 1 or vice-versa). Similarly, for small absolute value of the velocity, the output should be low. 3. With the increase of velocity, the value of the transfer function must rise. If an atom is moving away from the best solution, it must have a higher probability of changing its position to previous one. Similarly, with the decrease of the velocity the value of the transfer function must decrease.\n\nIn this work, we have used two different types of transfer functions  (Mirjalili & Lewis, 2013 ):\n\n1.

      "text": "One of the main challenges in FS is to search for a proper trade-off between exploration and exploitation. Each FS algorithm has its own way to find such a balance. In ASO, this trade-off is managed by the value of K(t) which is computed by equation (  16 ). In order to ensure exploration at the initial stage, the value of K(t) is kept large (for small t values). Large value of K(t) lets each atom interact with many of its neighbors having better fitness values. With increasing iteration (t), the value of K(t) decreases and the atoms interact with a smaller number of its neighbors having better fitness values which, in turn, enhances exploitation in the later stages. Thus, ASO ensures exploration during initial iterations and exploitation during final iterations. But, the value of K(t) may become as low as 2 which cannot lead to proper exploitation of the search space and makes it almost impossible to avoid local optima. To increase the exploitation ability of ASO and bypass the stagnation of atoms in local optima, we have embedded a local search technique named Simulated Annealing (SA) into ASO. Proposed by Kirkpatric et al. in  (Kirkpatrick, Gelatt, & Vecchi, 1983) , SA is hill climbing based single-solution meta-heuristic procedure which accepts worse solutions with some probability in the hope to circumvent local optima. After each iteration of ASO, each atom in the final set of population undergoes SA to improve the quality of the solution and to overcome local optima. The algorithm begins with creating a neighbor of an atom through perturbation of the atom. If the fitness of the neighbor exceeds that of the atom, then the neighbor is always accepted as a solution else it is accepted with certain probability determined by Boltzmann probability which is defined in equation (  21 ) where curFitness is the fitness of the generated neighbor and bestFitness is the fitness of the best solution found so far among all the generated neighbors. Temp is an important parameter in the process known as the temperature which determines the number of times neighbors needs to be evaluated for a particular atom. Temp is initialized to 2 * |N| where |N| is the total number of features present in the dataset and decreased as Temp = 0.93 * Temp (cooling schedule) as used in  (Jensen & Shen, 2003) .",

In this work, all the (X, Y) coordinate points are connected consecutively using DDA line drawing algorithm to form a stroke. Considering pen up and pen down information, all the strokes are generated accordingly to obtain of the final digit image. After that each image is normalized to capture the text part only. Sample images per class is shown in Table  2 . The dataset contains only 45-digit sample per class which are further augmented by rotating each image by an angle X. Where X takes only integer value and ranges from -5 to 5 degree. This results 500 samples per class that is further used in the feature extraction.\n\nInitially, all the input images are normalized to 32 × 32 dimension to make the data of consistent resolution that facilitates us to implement any feature extraction technique uniformly.",

HOG is a texture-based feature descriptor which adopts histogram of the gradients as a statistical measure. Primary idea behind the concept is that, any local shape and object can be demonstrated using the gradient intensity distribution or edge direction (S. Ghosh, Bhowmik, Ghosh, Sarkar, & Chakraborty, 2019). As HOG is invariant to geometric transformation, it is widely used in pattern recognition domain. In the computation part, first of all the entire image is divided into cells. After that, gradients are calculated according to equation 22.\n\nIn this work, one dimensional gradient is taken. A matrix M = [1 0 -1] is used to calculate the gradient in the X direction, Grad X . Subsequently, M T is adopted for gradient in Y direction, Grad Y . The final gradient direction Grad Dir is calculated using the equation 22.\n\nIn the further processing, the entire gradient direction domain (0 to 360 degree) is divided into 8 bins. For each cell, the histogram of the obtained gradient directions is calculated based on the 8 bins. Finally, those histograms from each cell are concatenated to get the final feature vector.",

It has been used for text non text classification in the recent past. The detailed formulation of LBP is described here.\n\nSuppose P cen = X cen , Y cen be the center pixel and it is surrounded by P surr number of pixels in a radius R. Each surrounding pixel can be described according to equation 23.\n\nLBP feature (LBP Feature ) is calculated using those surrounding pixel by comparing their intensity values. If the surrounding pixel is greater than equal to the center pixel, then we assign 1 else 0 is assigned. The formula is given in equation 24.\n\nLBP Feature = [LBPf(P 0 , P cen ), LBPf(P 1 , P cen ), … … . . , LBPf(P P surr -1 , P cen )] (24)\n\nThe function LBPf is a comparator which is explained in equation 25.\n\nIn our proposed work, we have considered R = 1. As a result, the LBP feature will be a binary string of 8 bit which is further converted to its equivalent decimal value. The final LBP value is formulated in equation 26.\n\nLBP val (P cen , P 1 , … … … . , P P surr -1 ) = ∑ LBPf(P n , P cen ) × 2 n P surr -1 n=0 (26)\n\nRotation Invariant LBP: Ojala et al.  (Ojala et al., 2002)  have also proposed a modified version of LBP known as rotation invariant LBP (RILBP), which is invariant to image rotation. Firstly, the binary pattern in calculated using LBP. Then, the pattern is rotated bit wise with the carry and new patterns are obtained after each rotation. Finally, the binary pattern that has minimum decimal value, is taken as the feature. The process can be devised using the equation 29.\n\nRILBP (P surr -1) (P cen , P 1 , … … … . , P P surr -1 ) = min{Rotate(LBP Feature , i | 0 ≤ i ≤ P surr -1)}\n\n(27)\n\nThen we calculate the equivalent decimal value of the rotation invariant binary string using equation 26. The centre pixel is replaced with the obtained value. After replacing all the pixels, we get the RILBP image. Finally, we take the histogram of the values to get the final feature vector.",

Similarly, the center pixel is replaced with the decimal equivalent of the string. Consequently, we shall get two channels of LTP image due to two strings for each center pixel. At the end, histogram of both the channels are taken as the final feature vector.\n\nUniform LTP: A transition in a binary string is defined as the change of 0 to 1 or change of 1 to 0.\n\nThe strings that contain less than or equal to two transitions are known as uniform strings and others are known as non-uniform strings. Main aim of using uniform pattern is to remove the redundant features and capture the information properly. Uniform property is incorporated with the two strings produced from LTP. In this case, we only consider the uniform strings and others are ignored. Finally, histogram of the uniform strings is considered as feature vector.\n\nLocal Tetra Pattern (LTRP): LTRP was first introduced by Murala et al.  (Murala, Maheshwari, & Balasubramanian, 2012)  in the domain of content based image retrieval. As LTRP is capable of capturing edge information prominently, it can be used in text, non-text separation purpose. The methodology of LTRP is described as follow.\n\nLet us consider S be an image segment of dimension 5 × 5. To start with, the first order derivative along vertical (i.e. 90°) and horizontal (i.e. 0°) directions are calculated and denoted by S α 1 (G c )|α = 0°, 90° where\n\nWhere, G 0○ denotes the gray level intensity value of the pixel along 0° and G 90○ indicates the intensity value along 90°. G c stands for the center pixel. Horizontal and vertical derivatives can be positive or negative. So, we shall get four different combinations due to their sign. The direction for the center pixel is given according to equation 32.\n\nSimilarly, we can get the direction for each of the neighboring pixels. After considering the direction of all the neighboring pixels, we get the second order LTrP 2 (G c ). This is formulated as equation 33.\n\nWhere, LTRPf is defined in equation 34.\n\nAs there are total 8 neighboring pixels, it will be an 8-bit pattern. Now, the string is four values code.\n\nFor each direction three binary patterns are generated. As there are total four possible directions for the center pixel, total 12 (= 3 × 4) binary patterns will be generated. An example is shown below where the center pixel direction is 4 (Dir 1 (G c ) = 4 according to equation 32).\n\nThese strings are generated using the derivative direction. The final string is generated from the gradient magnitude. The gradient magnitude is defined in equation 37.\n\nThe gradient magnitude for all the neighbors and center pixels is calculated. Now, the gradient magnitude is compared among the center and neighbor pixels. The generation of the 13 th binary string is formulated in equation 38.\n\nWhere,\n\nWe get 13 channels of LTRP image due to the 13 different strings for each center pixel. In case of LTP we got 2 channels, whereas, in LBP we got one channel.\n\nUniform 𝐋𝐓𝐑𝐏 (𝐔𝐋𝐓𝐑𝐏): The uniform property is described in the previous section. In ULTRP, we consider only the uniform strings among those 13 obtained strings. Finally, histogram of those uniform strings is taken to get the final feature vector.\n\nRotation Invariant 𝐋𝐓𝐑𝐏 (RILTRP): Previously, rotation invariant property is explained. After getting those 13 strings, rotation invariant property is applied on those strings. Finally, the histogram is considered for the final feature vector.\n\nNumber of features obtained by each of the above-mentioned methods is shown in Table  4 .",

To overcome this, a proper pre-processing technique is very essential. Viola Jones Haar  (Viola & Jones, 2004)  has been adopted\n\nto capture the important region from the entire image.

Gabor filter is invariant to scale, translation and rotation.

While mapping the continuous values in ASO to the binary space of FS, we have used two different transfer functions: one V-shaped (ASOv) and one S-shaped (ASOs). In addition, we have also included SA to enhance exploitation in ASO and named then ASOv-SA and ASOs-SA. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time ASO has been applied for FS problem.\n\nThe performances of the proposed approaches are assessed by applying them on 25 datasets, which are from 4 different categories. We have applied the proposed methods on UCI, Handwritten digit recognition, Text/Non-text separation and FER datasets. These datasets are from completely belong to different domains, which give us clear idea about robustness of the proposed FS techniques. Two criteria are considered, classification accuracy and number of features for measuring the strength of the proposed methods. By using FS, we are able to achieve much higher accuracy with less number of features, irrespective of the domain of the datasets.\n\nTo compare the proposed methods with other FS techniques, we have considered different recently published meta-heuristic FS methods. The proposed methods have beat all the methods in comparison in terms of classification accuracy and beat most of the methods in terms of number of selected features. ASOs-SA and ASOv-SA have achieved higher accuracy than ASOs and ASOv respectively, in multiple cases. This justifies the use of SA. Another thing to be noticed, ASOv outperforms ASOs when it comes to number of selected features.\n\nFor future studies, we can apply different local search technique with ASO or use different classifiers. Along with that we can try other domains with large feature dimension (> 10000). It would also be really interesting if we are able to hybridize ASO with another population based metaheuristic algorithms.",
