      "text": "The 2019 Coronavirus Disease (COVID-19) was first officially reported as an acute respiratory infection caused by an unknown virus in Wuhan city, Hubei province in China, on 31 December 2019. According to the World Health Organization (WHO) 's COVID-19 situation dashboard  1  , as of 17 June 2022, the disease has infected 535,863,950 people worldwide and claimed 6,314,972 lives  [1] .\n\nThe pandemic presents complex and evolving problems that warrant multidisciplinary research and a globally concerted effort. The complexity comes from the disease itself and the surge of the medical, scientific, social, behavioural, and economic issues that the disease has brought about. These issues include reports on daily counts of new cases and mortality rates, scientific discoveries, government responses, news reporting of social behaviours such as panic buying and food hoarding, impact on businesses and economic outlook, and changes in people's everyday lives. The problems are multi-faceted and unprecedented.\n\nThere is a growing recognition of the need for multidisciplinary research efforts to support the COVID-19 pandemic response, including disciplines such as social and behavioural science  [2]  and mental health science  [3] .\n\nTwitter is a popular microblogging site widely used by Internet users. According to Statista, as of the first quarter of 2022, Twitter had 229 million active users worldwide, an increase of over 50 per cent from the 152 million users in the fourth quarter of 2019 2    [4] . Twitter provides the research community with a rich source of information about when, where, and what people have to say in their posts (known as \"tweets\") through its free, publicly accessible standard application programming interface (API) service. However, the raw tweet content is mainly in textual format and is not readily analysable. When there are many tweets, it takes a significant time to accurately extract information about people's concerns, feelings, and emotions for analysts and researchers to process and analyse for in-depth patterns and insights.\n\nThis paper describes the data collection and processing methods that enable the development of the full dataset we released for academic research use since its first version in July 2020.\n\nWith tweet-by-tweet labelled data systematically extracted and made available to the research communities, our purpose is to enable more researchers to perform in-depth investigations in all possible research-worthy areas, such as discovering the correlational patterns between other variables such as government measures and communication of these measures, demographics, economic indicators, and epidemiological markers. Figure  1  presents the schematic structure of the data.",

      "text": "As early as the first half of 2020, a few studies have leveraged Twitter data for COVID-19 research (e.g.,  [5, 6, 7] ). Twitter has also opened up real-time, full-fidelity data streams 4  related to COVID-19 tweets since late April 2020  [8] . Researchers have also systematically collected and shared COVID-19-related tweets datasets for open research use  [9, 10, 11] . However, to the best of our knowledge, no existing datasets provide a research resource with rich, semantically, and psychologically meaningful attributes surrounding the topics, sentiments, and emotions content of the tweets. In contrast, the dataset described in this paper provides a novel, tweet-by-tweet level tagging of the topic clusters that a tweet is semantically related to, the sentiment the tweet is expressing, and the emotional properties, in terms of the intensity of the emotion as well as the type of the emotion, associated with each of the tweets.\n\nThe subsequent sections of the paper describe the data collection and processing methods with a focused interest in tracking and understanding the latent topics, sentiments, and emotions surrounding the COVID-19 pandemic. We applied natural language processing (NLP) techniques, specifically statistical topic clustering techniques, that detect tweets surrounding similar topic clusters. We also applied pre-trained machine learning algorithms (CrystalFeel) to tag each tweet with a sentiment valence (unpleasantness/pleasantness) and intensity scores of four different emotions -fear, anger, happiness, and sadness.",

We first used three keywords \"corona\", \"wuhan\" (many people refer to the virus as \"wuhan virus\" at the initial stages before the official name was announced), and \"nCov\" (WHO first named the virus as \"2019-nCov\"). On 11 February 2020, upon WHO's officially renaming of the disease as \"COVID-19\", we added \"covid\" as a new search keyword.\n\nAs vaccination is one of the key measures to fight against the COVID-19 virus, we also started to collect vaccine-related tweets in late October 2021. We used nine keywords \"vaccine\", \"pfizer\", \"moderna\", \"covaxin\", \"astrazeneca\", \"covishield\", \"janseen\", \"sinova\", and \"sinopharm\".\n\nWe focused on English tweets and used the language filter with the Twitter API. Simple sharing of these tweets (i.e., retweets) is not collected for the dataset to ensure the conciseness of the data.\n\nThe Twitter API returns the tweet text content with a rich range of attributes. For example, we were able to download the following 12 attributes in our local database. The UTC datetime that the user account was created on Twitter",

      "text": "Although all the retrieved tweets are relevant to at least one of the four COVID-19-related keywords, many facets or subtopics have been covered in the tweets' \"text\" content. We applied an unsupervised topic clustering technique called Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) to understand the subtopics. LDA is a probabilistic generative model which learns a multinomial distribution of latent topics in a given document  [14] . The advantage of LDA is that it is independent of the corpus size, making it algorithmically efficient to learn topic clusters within a corpus with many tweets such as ours.\n\nFirst, we pre-processed each raw tweet by converting it to ASCII characters, removing accented characters, forming bigrams and trigrams, filtering out stop words (including most rare and most frequent words), and performing text tokenization. These pre-processed tweets were then converted into a bag-of-words (BoW) corpus. The training data's date range is 28 January 2020 to 27 May 2020, consisting of 51 million tweets.\n\nNext, we randomly sampled 1% of the BoW corpus and trained an LDA model whose inference was performed using online variational Bayes  [15] . Using the trained LDA-based topic model, we obtained 100 topic clusters. The following list illustrates the top ten topics detected in the dataset (e.g., \"topic 1\") and the ten most representative words associated with each detected topic (e.g., \"people, cases, new, deaths, time, china, realdonaldtrump, lockdown, trump\" for \"topic 1\"), respectively.\n\n• Lastly, for each tweet in the entire dataset, we assigned a relevance label (\"1\" or \"0\") using the trained LDA model based on the contribution of each topic (over a total of 100 topic clusters) to the tweet (\"1\" indicates if the contribution is > 1%, where \"0\" indicates otherwise).\n\nTable  1  shows example tweets that are tagged with the corresponding topic clusters, respectively. The first ten examples show tweets that are solely relevant to each of the ten topic clusters. The last example shows that a tweet can be relevant to multiple topic clusters simultaneously.",

The development of CrystalFeel involved training and experimental evaluations of features derived from affective lexicons, parts-of-speech, and word embeddings  [17] , using tweets manually annotated with ground truth values  [18] . Table  2  shows five example tweets tagged with these five attributes: valence intensity, fear intensity, anger intensity, happiness intensity, and sadness intensity. The first example shows a tweet with a moderate (i.e., neither very negative nor very positive) \"valence_intensity\". 6 CrystalFeel is accessible via https://socialanalyticsplus.net/crystalfeel\n\nExample tweet text t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 \"Remember when doja cat said corona was just the flu\" 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 \"STAY SAFE from CORONAVIRUS There is currently no antiviral treatment or vaccine to prevent Coronavirus (COVID-19)\" 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 \"No. It is a part of One Belt One Road. #ChinaVirus WHO says Wuhan coronavirus outbreak is not yet a pandemic\" 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 \"Bill Gates: This is how long it may take before Americans can be completely safe from COVID-19\" 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 \"Florida's COVID-19 website guru blasts bosses, hints at data suppression\" 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 \"Municipality closes 336 shops in all six governorates for violating corona rules\" 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 \"@Naveen_Odisha @narendramodi @MoHFW_INDIA @PrakashJavdekar @drharshvardhan @dr_arunsahoo I request to postpone our…\" 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 \"Previously its DAM funds. now ita corona fund. pochna sirf ye tha k DAM fund kaha tk pohancha\" 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 \"apparently child abuse cases are going up and the excuse is that parents are stressed over covid-19. im sorry but\" 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 \"today i found out weed kills the corona virus and i ain't been worried since\" 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 \"PICS: Built in 10 days -1000 bed hospital opens to battle coronavirus in Wuhan All 4 Women\"\n\nThe other four examples show tweets with relatively high-intensity scores for happiness, anger, fear, and sadness dimensions.\n\nNote that, in some instances, such as the fourth example (\"Being higher risk of covid has me all over the place. Appt is in about 90 mins. Im scared, worried and anxious\"), the intensity score may be exceeding 0-1 range, which indicates that these cases represented extreme intensities beyond the algorithms' original training samples.",

We used CrystalFeel's \"emotion\" output to facilitate the interpretation of the COVID-19 tweets.\n\nThe \"emotion\" output was obtained using the following logic that leverages all the valence and emotions intensities scores from CrystalFeel's outputs. It first uses \"valence_intensity\" as the first-line criterion as this dimension has very high accuracy, i.e., 0.816 in terms of Pearson correlation with human-annotated ground truth values  [16, 17] . It then uses the relative intensity comparing the three primary negative emotions, anger, fear and sadness to assign a corresponding dominant emotion category. Whenever there is a tie, i.e., a tweet may have identical intensity scores across fear, anger, and sadness, the emotion category is assigned as \"anger\", followed by \"fear\", and \"sadness\". The empirical basis is that anger intensity has the highest accuracy, i.e., 0.818 in terms of the Pearson correlation value  [16, 17] . The following script describes the conversion logic:\n\n// # Initialize the sentiment category in a \"no specific emotion\" class 1 emotion = \"no specific emotion\"; // # Assign the emotion category when valence intensity score exceeds 0.52 2 if(valence_intensity > 0.52): 3 emotion = \"happiness\"; // # Assign the emotion category when valence intensity score falls below 0.48 4 elif(valence_intensity < 0.48): 5 emotion = \"anger\"; 6 if((fear_intensity > anger_intensity) and (fear_intensity > = sadness_intensity )): 7 emotion = \"fear\"; 8 elif((sadness_intensity > anger_intensity) and (sadness_intensity > fear_intensity)): 9 emotion = \"sadness\";\n\nTable  4  shows the five tweet examples tagged with the dominant emotion categories.",

Other conversion logic may be explored in future research. For example, Mohammad et al.

Plotting the \"sentiment\" values over daily aggregated tweet counts suggested subtler patterns (see Figure  3 ). For example, the single-day peak during this period was 1,075,087 tweets (629,938 were \"negative\" tweets and 65,165 were \"very negative\" tweets), which took place on 13 March 2020, one day immediately following the WHO's announcement on the disease as a \"pandemic\". Further analysis may look into, for example, the sentiment changes before and after more targeted periods based on critical announcements (e.g., to study a week before and after 13 March 2020). The dataset may also allow further research to explore the correlations and predictive values based on the sentiment and emotion scores when overlaid with economic indicators (e.g., stock market changes).  We checked the daily counts of the four emotions for the 28 months (see Figure  4 ). The significance of the change can be illustrated using the contrast of results at the start and the end of our data range.\n\nFor example, as of 28 January 2020, a total of 23,405 tweets were posted for the day, and the tweets with \"anger\" as the dominant emotion formed 15.3% of the total 23,405 tweets, far less than those tweets with \"fear\" as the most dominant emotion which formed 52.5% of the total 23,405 tweets. In contrast, as of 5 October 2020, a total of 602,206 total tweets were posted for the day, and the tweets with \"anger\" as the most dominant emotion formed 39.1%, exceeding those tweets with \"fear\" as the most dominant emotion, which formed 20.1%).",

According to Statista's estimate  [25] , the United States, Japan, India, United Kingdom, Brazil, Indonesia, Turkey, Saudi Arabia, Mexico, and France are leading countries based on the number of Twitter users as of January 2021. Overall, we found that 134,718,945 tweets (53.3% of the 252,600,524 tweets) have countryidentifiable \"location\" information as declared by the users at their Twitter public profile. We believe that this is a reasonable proportion to facilitate assessing the dataset's geographic representativeness.\n\nTable  13  shows the number of vaccine-related tweets that are identifiable for ten countries.\n\nThe top three countries that reported the highest number of vaccine-related tweets in English are the United States, the United Kingdom, and Canada.",

      "text": "This paper presents a very large COVID-19 Twitter dataset with psychologically meaningful attributes. This dataset may create opportunities to understand both global and local conversations and social sentiments in real-time, at a large scale, potentially leading to rich insights into human behaviours and behavioural changes surrounding the unprecedented pandemic. We discuss its current usage and envisage future use in five broad areas.\n\nMedia and communication research. First, for media and communication research, the dataset can be helpful for communication scientists and professionals to evaluate and improve government response, policies, and media communications towards the unprecedented pandemic crisis. For example, a recent study compared the communications efforts of health authorities in the United States, the United Kingdom, and Singapore on Facebook during the early period of COVID-19  [26] .\n\nLwin et al.  [7]  used a part of this dataset and presented the first rapid report that has shed light on the global sentiment change in people's emotional responses to the pandemic. It focused on the emotion category attribute and found that anger has overtaken fear as the dominant emotion in the share of tweets from 28 January 2020 to 9 April 2020. A follow-on study by Lwin et al.  [27]  examined the evolution of sentiments, using a comparative analysis of change in sentiments across five countries India, Singapore, South Korea, the United Kingdom, and the United States from 28 January 2020 to 28 April 2021. The study focused on the sentiment category attribute as the main index variable and found that while negative sentiments were predominant during the initial period of the pandemic, positive sentiments arose at differing intensities across the five countries, particularly in Asian countries.\n\nAs the virus continuously affects different countries in different timeframes and governments implemented different response strategies and policies, one direction of an ongoing related work overlays the location attribute, examining and comparing sentiments, emotions, and topics associated with different countries. The dataset may also help to study how media's topical and emotional framing in their headlines and titles are different from those expressed by the general public.\n\nPsychology. Second, the dataset is of inherent interest for psychology research. The granularity of the tweet's metadata may allow researchers to dive deeper into more nuanced trends with profound psychological accounts and insights. One possibility is to look into the sentiments and emotional differences over more fine-grained timelines, examine cultural differences and segregate the users who are influencers vs. the general public. Research may also look into leveraging user characteristics inference techniques (e.g.,  [28] ) and the present dataset to investigate user community-specific tendencies and issues. Kamila et al.  [29]  used a part of this dataset and examined the association between one's temporal orientation (focusing on past, present or future) and emotions (fear, anger, joy and sadness) using a part of this dataset. The study revealed that future orientation is associated with joy and anger, and past orientation is associated with fear and sadness.\n\nPopulation mental health and well-being. Third, as the pandemic escalates in its severity and geographical span and is likely to last for a prolonged period, public mental health issues (e.g.,  [30] ) are more prevalent. The dataset may be used to examine public mental health and well-being. Prior literature (e.g.,  [31, 32] ) has established the linkage between fear (as an emotion) and anxiety (as a mental disorder) and between sadness (as an emotion category) and depression (as a mental disorder). It can be fruitful to study the value of the emotion intensity scores and their trends in the context of their duration, frequency, and various user communities.\n\nIn the area of supporting mental healthcare needs, Nimmi et al.  [33]  trained a deep learning ensemble model for emotion identification using a part of this dataset and call content of an emergency response support system. They found the new model achieved high accuracy in terms of attaining a macro-average F1 score of 85.2 per cent.\n\nEconomics. Fourth, it is potentially valuable to overlay publicly available economic indicators (e.g., daily stock market data, monthly unemployment rates reports) and investigate how the topics, sentiments, and emotional trends present predictive value in future research.\n\nEpidemiology. Last but not least, data scientists and epidemiology researchers may find the dataset useful. For example, prior research on Zika  [34]  and other infectious disease outbreaks  [35]  has studied and found insights into overlaying with air travel networks and virus genome. Hence the dataset may reveal more hidden patterns and relationships between the large-scale social media content and other pandemic-related data streams. Future work may also explore the forecasting or predictive value of the social media data and emotion indicators in the spread of the virus and cases. considers the need to be consistent with Twitter's terms of service as the dataset is built upon the content provided by Twitter's standard API.",
