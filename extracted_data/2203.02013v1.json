Here is an example from visualizing a trained LXMERT model on VQA: without disentangling, the explanation highlights both parts of the table and the glass bottle; with disentangling, we can see that the unimodal contributions look at the image without looking at the question and highlights the glass bottle, wine glass, and glass table, all of which could support the answer glass, while the multimodal interaction knows that only the table matters, so it focuses only on the table. Therefore, with DIME, we can be certain that the model identifies the table as the reason for answering \"glass\", and not the bottle instead. In this paper, we show that DIME can accurately perform disentanglement and generate explanations for both UC and MI to help researchers better interpret multimodal models.",

      "text": "As machine learning models are increasingly deployed in real-world scenarios, it has motivated the development of interpretable machine learning (ML) as a research field with the goal of understanding Advantages DIME (ours) LIME  [52]  EMAP  [23]  M2Lens  [    [23, 52, 62] , DIME disentangles a multimodal model into unimodal contributions and multimodal interactions and generates accurate explanations for each, while remaining generalizable (not designed specifically for any model, modality, or task) and works for black-box models (does not require knowledge of the internal structure of the model). DIME can help human users determine the dominant factor behind a model's decisions, gain insight into what specific multimodal interactions are captured, and reveal undesirable behavior for debugging or improving the model. (*) EMAP can only sometimes distinguish the dominant factor between UC or MI: according to Hessel and Lee  [23] , EMAP can give insight on individual data points only under special conditions (such as when EMAP happens to flip the prediction).\n\nML models, performing model debugging, and using these insights to better inform the interaction between AI and humans in joint decision making  [7, 12, 18] . Recently, the promise of multimodal models for real-world representation learning in numerous applications such as multimedia  [39, 40, 45] , affective computing  [42, 50] , robotics  [33, 36] , finance  [25] , dialogue  [49] , human-computer interaction  [15, 46] , and healthcare  [64]  has invigorated research into multimodal machine learning, which brings unique challenges for both computational and theoretical research given the heterogeneity of various data sources and difficulty of capturing correspondences between modalities  [4] . Among one of these core challenges is interpretable multimodal learning with the end goal of empowering various stakeholders by providing insights into multimodal learning, improving model design, or debugging models and datasets.\n\nRecent work in interpretable multimodal learning has therefore focused on constructing interpretable multimodal models via careful model design  [48, 59, 66]  or performing post-hoc explanations of black-box multimodal models  [10, 21] . However, existing works typically focus on building interpretable models using suitable inductive biases, such as designing multimodal routing networks  [59] , graph-based fusion  [66] , or multimodal explanation networks to highlight visual importance  [48] . Some of these approaches also require the collection of specialized datasets annotated for visual explanations as intermediate steps in training interpretable models  [48] . On the other hand, with the trend towards large-scale modeling or pre-training as an alternative over individual modality-specific or task-specific models  [37, 40] , it is increasingly important to design general-purpose approaches that (1) are able to generate post-hoc explanations for arbitrary black-box models, and (2) does not assume anything about the modality or classification task itself.\n\nAs a step towards more fine-grained interpretations of generalpurpose multimodal models across arbitrary tasks, we propose DIME, an interpretation method for black-box multimodal models. While existing work has been able to generate useful explanations to help humans understand model decision-making processes  [10] , they are often only performed at one step of the entire multimodal decisionmaking process. These singular steps typically include attributing feature importance  [10, 48]  or representation importance  [59, 66] . The core idea in DIME is to provide more fine-grained interpretations by disentangling a multimodal model into unimodal contributions (UC) and multimodal interactions (MI). We show that this key insight enables more accurate and fine-grained analysis of multimodal models while maintaining generality across arbitrary modalities, model architectures  [28, 57] , and tasks  [19, 27] .\n\nThrough a comprehensive suite of experiments on both synthetic and real-world multimodal tasks, we show that DIME is able to accurately perform disentanglement and generate reliable explanations for both UC and MI. Using DIME, we are able to gain a deeper understanding of model behavior on challenging multimodal tasks. For example, on VQA 2.0  [20] , we successfully use DIME to determine whether the model uses correct multimodal interactions to answer the questions, as shown in Figure  1 . By providing these model explanations to a human annotator, they are able to gain additional insights on model behavior and better determine whether UC, MI, or both are the dominant factor behind the model's predictions on individual datapoints. Furthermore, DIME presents a step towards debugging and improving these models by systematically revealing certain undesirable behaviors.",

These approaches can be roughly categorized into interpretable ML as designing models which are understandable by design, and explainable ML which focuses on producing post-hoc explanations for black-box models  [54] . In the former, methods such as Concept Bottleneck Models  [34]  and fitting sparse linear layers  [63]  or decision trees on top of deep feature representations  [61]  have emerged as promising choices marrying the expressive power of deep features with the interpretable decision-making processes of linear models or decision trees. In the latter, approaches such as saliency maps  [55, 56] , using surrogate models to interpret local decision boundaries  [52] , feature visualizations  [16, 65] , and assigning semantic concepts  [5]  all aim to provide insight into model predictions for specific input instances.

      "text": "Similar to the interpretation of unimodal models, recent work in interpretable multimodal learning can be categorized into two sections: (1) constructing interpretable multimodal models via careful model design  [48, 59, 66]  or (2) performing post-hoc explanations of black-box multimodal models  [10, 21] . In the former, multimodal routing networks  [59] , graph-based fusion techniques  [41, 66] , multimodal explanation networks to highlight visual importance  [48] , hard-attention  [11] , and neuro-symbolic reasoning methods  [3, 60]  have emerged as strong design choices as a step towards more interpretable multimodal learning. These approaches individually focus on building interpretable components for either modality importance  [48] , cross-modal interactions  [41, 59, 66] , or the reasoning process on top of cross-modal interactions  [3, 60] . While these approaches provide reliable interpretations by virtue of model design, they are typically restricted to a certain set of modalities or tasks. On the other hand, we propose a more general approach that is able to generate post-hoc explanations for arbitrary black-box multimodal models, and does not assume anything about the modality or classification task itself.\n\nIn the latter section on post-hoc explainability of black-box multimodal models, related work has similarly gravitated towards aiming to understand either modality importance  [10, 21, 29]  or cross-modal interactions in pretrained language and vision transformer models  [9, 17, 38, 47] . Perhaps most related to our work is Wang et al.  [62]  proposing M2Lens, an interactive visual analytics system to visualize and explain black-box multimodal models for sentiment analysis through both unimodal and multimodal contributions. Our approach further disentangles the two types of contributions, which allows us to generate visualizations on each and gain insight into which input features are involved in multimodal interactions. Our approach is also not restricted to sentiment analysis.",

Disentangled representation learning has been shown to improve both generative and discriminative performance in multimodal tasks  [58] . If the factors of variation are known, many methods learn latent attributes that individually control each variation of data by supervised training  [14, 30, 51] . If the factors are partially known or unknown, deep generative models can be used to impose an isotropic Gaussian prior on the latent variables  [24, 32, 53] , maximize the mutual information between a subset of latent variables and the data  [13] , or to encourage the distribution of representations to be factorial and hence independent  [31] .

Using these tools, researchers have uncovered several biases existing in machine learning models and datasets. These biases include undesirable associations captured either in the data or the model, which do not reflect decision-making as one would expect. For example, a line of work in visualizing and understanding multimodal models has uncovered unimodal biases in the language modality of VQA tasks  [1, 2, 8, 26] , which then inspired follow-up datasets to elevate the importance of visual understanding through VQA 2.0  [20] . Similar visualizations also led to improved performance on image captioning tasks by relying less on gender biases and spurious correlations  [22] . Our approach towards better visualizing and understanding multimodal models is also inspired by these insights, and we believe that our fine-grained and general approach will motivate future work towards removing biases from a wider range of datasets and models beyond the prototypical language and vision tasks.",

LIME works by subdividing the input into distinct features, and then randomly perturbing the features 𝑆 times to see how the perturbations on the features affect the model output logits of a specific class 𝑐. LIME then fits a linear model mapping the perturbations on each feature to the logits of 𝑐. The linear model weights on each feature gives the explanation of that feature: if the weight is positive, it means that this feature supports the decision of class 𝑐; if the weight is negative, it means that this feature is against the decision of class 𝑐; the larger the weight's absolute value, the stronger the contribution is. Visually, the weights can also be used to generate a humaninterpretable visualization: for images, each feature is typically a part of the image, so the parts with the highest absolute weights can be highlighted in green for positive and red for negative contributions. For text, each feature is typically a word, so the explanation can be summarized as a histogram of weights of each word (see Figure  2  for an example).\n\nWhen running LIME on multimodal inputs, we run LIME on one modality at a time, treating the inputs to all other modalities as constant and only perturbing the inputs to that one modality.

To show that this also holds in practice (when expectation computations are replaced by sampling), we will run DIME on our trained model 𝑀 using 1, 000 randomly selected datapoints in the test split of our synthetic dataset 𝐷, on label 1 (i.e., that the sum of all elements of both vectors plus the dot-product of the two vectors are positive).\n\nFor each point (𝑑 1 , 𝑑 2 ) in 𝐷, since we are classifying whether the sum of all elements in 𝑑 1 and 𝑑 2 as well as the dot product of 𝑑 1 and 𝑑 2 , the ground truth UC explanation on each modality will be 𝑑 1 and 𝑑 2 respectively, and the ground truth MI explanation will be elementwise product 𝑑 1 * 𝑑 2 . Therefore, for each generated explanation on input data (𝑑 1 , 𝑑 2 ), we will compute the Pearson Correlation between the explanation weights of the 10 features with the values of the 10 features of 𝑑 1 , the values of the 10 features of 𝑑 2 , and the 10 features in the element-wise product of 𝑑 1 and 𝑑 2 . In addition to DIME, we also run LIME under the same settings as an ablation and compute average correlations.\n\nThe results are shown in Table  2 . We found that within each datapoint (𝑑 1 ,𝑑 2 ), there is a strong correlation between each DIMEgenerated unimodal explanation (UC 1 , UC 2 ) and the corresponding ground truth UC explanation, but there is neither correlation between UC 1 /UC 2 and ground truth UC explanation of a different modality, nor correlation between UC 1 /UC 2 and ground truth multimodal interaction explanations. This shows that DIME-generated UC explanations indeed capture unimodal contributions only. Moreover, we found that both DIME-generated multimodal interaction explanations (MI 1 , MI 2 ) indeed correlate with the ground truth MI explanation, but not with either ground truth UC explanation. This shows that DIME-generated multimodal interaction explanation indeed captures explanations on just the multimodal interactions (i.e., the dot-product), and not any of the unimodal contributions. Meanwhile, running the original LIME on either modality just gives an explanation that weakly correlates with ground truth unimodal contributions and multimodal interactions, so the original LIME without disentangling is unable to give an accurate explanation of either unimodal contributions or multimodal interactions.\n\nIn addition to using a synthetic dataset, we show that DIME can also disentangle more complex models on multimodal tasks, such as MDETR on CLEVR and LXMERT on VQA (the latter model is far from perfect in performance). As a measure of disentanglement, we check how DIME-generated explanations would be different given the same image but different questions. From each dataset, we randomly select 100 points and generate their DIME explanations on the correct label. Then, for each point, we swap out the question with another different question on the same image and generate With disentanglement in DIME, the unimodal contribution explanations completely correlates with their respective unimodal ground truth, and the multimodal interaction explanations completely correlates with the ground truth multimodal interactions (i.e., element-wise product of the two inputs). On the other hand, running LIME without disentangling gives an explanation that confuses both unimodal contributions and multimodal interactions.",

In the following experiments, we show that DIME can uncover which factor is dominant in a model's prediction process both across all points in the dataset (\"global\") and on each individual datapoint (\"local\").\n\nGlobal interpretation: CLEVR dataset is designed to force multimodal interactions, and MDETR has a 99.7% accuracy on CLEVR, so we expect that MDETR will be heavily reliant on multimodal interactions.

As shown in Table  4 , the MI 𝑉 and 𝑀𝑉 𝑇 weights are indeed significantly larger than UC 𝑉 and UC 𝑇 weights.

The average weight for MI 𝑉 , however, is over 4 times higher than UC 𝑉 . Therefore, using DIME, we confirmed that MDETR indeed relies mostly on multimodal interactions to solve the task.\n\nLocal interpretation: In most datasets and models, models will not be near-perfect, and they will have different dominating factors  from datapoint to datapoint. In this case, a global analysis will not suffice, and it will be necessary to look into which factor contributes more to the model's prediction on individual datapoints. We perform the following experiment to show that DIME can help users determine whether a model makes a prediction on a datapoint where (1) unimodal text is dominant, (2) unimodal image is dominant, (3) multimodal interactions are dominant, and (4) both UC and MI have significant contributions to the answer. We will use LXMERT on VQA since LXMERT is not close to perfect and often relies on different factors when predicting different datapoints.\n\nWe gave five human annotators (who have some background knowledge in machine learning but do not have any knowledge about DIME) the same set of 52 datapoints from VQA, as well as the prediction from LXMERT. For each datapoint, each human annotator is first given the LIME explanations without disentanglement as a baseline, and they are asked to categorize this point into one of the four categories above, while also rating how confident they are on their decision on a scale from one (least confident) to five (most confident). The human annotators are then presented with DIME explanations, and again they are asked to categorize each point as well as rate their confidence.\n\nThe results are shown in Table  5 . We can see that human annotators have significantly higher average confidence scores when presented with DIME explanations as compared to the baseline. Moreover, DIME result shows significantly higher Krippendorff's alpha score  [35] , which measures inter-annotator agreements, so annotators also tend to agree a lot more on their categorizations. Therefore, DIME is able to help researchers more confidently determine whether UC or MI (or both) is the dominant factor behind the model's prediction, and thus help researchers gain additional insight into model behavior.",

We can see that on average, human annotators gave much higher confidence score to the DIME explanation compared to LIME without disentanglement, and human annotators also tend to agree more on decisions based on DIME.\n\nWhen trying to debug or improve a model on a task involving challenging reasoning, such as VQA, one important question researchers often ask is: do we know if our model actually learns to do the task \"the intended way\" (i.e., go through the same logical reasoning process as a human would to perform the task)? How often does our model perform as intended? Therefore, we conduct the following experiment to show that DIME may help answer this question.\n\nWe use DIME explanations to categorize the model's behavior on each datapoint into one of the following categories:\n\nWhen the model answers correctly,\n\n• • (4) The model fully identifies the necessary parts of the image to answer the question logically through MI, but still gets the answer wrong because the model does not fully understand a concept or because the question is too difficult (even for a human being). • (5) The model only partially identifies the parts of the image that are necessary to answer the question logically through MI, thus missing some of the key parts of the image resulting in an incorrect answer. • (6) The model did not correctly identify any of the parts of the image that are necessary to answer the question logically through MI, and thus the model fails to answer the question correctly. In Figure  4 , we show examples of datapoints, model predictions, and explanations that were annotated into each of the above categories. As shown in the examples, in most cases, there will be enough evidence to categorize a datapoint just by looking at the multimodal interaction explanations from the image side (MI 𝑉 ), but sometimes other DIME explanations (e.g., explanations of text interactions) will be needed to gain additional understanding of the model's decision-making process.\n\nThe results of this human study are shown in Table  6 . With DIME, we were able to categorize 118 points with evidence, out of a total of 140 points (84%). This shows that DIME is able to highlight which input features are aligned or recognized by MI. We observe that,  even though the models can fully identify the correct parts of the image that are relevant to the questions half of the time (69/118), there is still a significant portion of datapoints where the model correctly aligns text and image but relies on unimodal contributions instead. This highlights several shortcomings of the model's decisionmaking process despite answering the question correctly. Therefore, the information gained from performing DIME can help researchers identify weaknesses in their models and debug or improve these models accordingly.\n\nWe also observe that the model is more likely to not be able to fully identify the correct regions of the image when the model makes the wrong prediction, which is expected.\n\nIn addition, we also found the following interesting observations when looking at the DIME explanations of the 118 points:\n\n• LXMERT often relies too heavily on unimodal text contributions: for example, in a question involving \"car\", unimodal contributions in text will prompt the model to answer \"street\" even if the model is unable to find \"street\" in the image. Sometimes, even when the model is able to interactively identify the correct regions of the image, unimodal text contributions can still dominate over the multimodal interaction (such as the fourth example in Figure  4 , where the model answered \"glove\" due to unimodal text contributions even though the model was able to interactively identify the bat). • The model sometimes interactively identifies the wrong object that happens to share the same properties in question as the correct object (such as the third example in Figure  4 , where instead of the dog's paws, the model identified the nearby cat which also happens to be white). This coincidence happens more often than we expected, as there are 8 such cases amongst the 118 examples (7%).\n\n• When asked about the color of an object that has two colors, LXMERT will only pick out one of the colors. DIME analysis shows that this is often due to LXMERT only identifying subregions of the object in one color while ignoring other parts of the object that are in a different color. For example, in Figure  5 , the model thinks that the hydrant is not \"silver and red\" because it did not classify the red tip as part of the hydrant. These additional observations may guide future research in improving LXMERT (and other similar models) or designing inductive biases to avoid these undesirable behaviors. The model accurately identifies both \"head\" and \"hat\" through multimodal interactions.\n\n( The model mistakenly identified the white cat as the black dog's paws, and since the cat happens to be the same color as the dog's paws, the model is able to answer the question correctly by chance.\n\n( The model is able to identify a part of the soup (the noodle and part of the shrimp), which happens to be white, so the model thinks the soup is creamy; the model fails to look at other part of the soup that shows the soup is actually not creamy.\n\nQ: What is on the child's hand? Correct A: bat Model A: glove\n\nThe model identifies the boy, the hand, and the bat; however, it still selected \"glove\" over \"bat\" due to strong unimodal contributions from text: the words \"what\", \"on\", \"hand\" basically strongly steered the model towards \"glove\".\n\nQ: What color is the streak? Correct A: red Model A: white (6) The model identifies none of the necessary parts of the image to answer the question logically.",

Models with discrete outputs: Even though DIME is designed to work for any black-box classification models, it requires the model to produce a continuous logit for each answer choice. DIME does not work well on the Neural-Symbolic VQA model  [44]  since it only produces one discrete output instead of a continuous logit. Even when we tried to convert its outputs to logits by assigning its answer a logit of 1 and all other answer choices a logit of -1, DIME often fails to produce any meaningful explanation since the perturbations are unable to change the discrete answer of the model, thus having no effect on the assigned logits.",

      "text": "In all experiments, DIME was applied to tasks with 2 modalities. Disentangling a model across even 3 modalities can be very costly, as we will need to run the model 𝑁 3 times to compute unimodal contributions. Another challenge lies in interpreting the multimodal interaction, which would consist of bi-modal interactions between each pair of modalities as well as tri-modal interactions across all 3 modalities. Future work should tackle these challenges and try to expand DIME for high-modality scenarios.\n\n3. Diverse modalities: Even though the disentangling method in DIME theoretically works on any modality, our experiments have focused on image+text datasets (except the synthetic dataset experiment). This is because LIME-generated visualized explanations are relatively intuitive on image and text; it can be much harder for a human annotator to look at the results of explanations on other modalities (such as time-series of vectors) and try to make sense of them. In the future, we would like to design additional experiments to show that DIME can also be used to gain additional insight on model behavior in tasks involving modalities other than image and text as well.\n\n4. Using these insights to improve models: Since DIME is able to reveal several hidden undesirable behaviors in multimodal models, future work should aim to propose targeted solutions to these highlighted biases as a step towards improving multimodal models. For example, according to insights gained on VQA in RQ3, LXMERT can be improved by encouraging less reliance on unimodal text contribution, where insights from Cadene et al.  [8]  (which studies this research question for non-pretrained models) could be useful. Furthermore, future work could also design new training objectives which penalize models that associate wrong objects with words in MI, despite getting the correct answer.",
