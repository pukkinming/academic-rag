      "text": "Whether literally or suggestively, the concept of soundscape is alluded in both modern and ancient music. In this study, we examine whether we can analyze and compare Western and Chinese classical music based on soundscape models. We addressed this question through a comparative study. Specifically, corpora of Western classical music excerpts (WCMED) and Chinese classical music excerpts (CCMED) were curated and annotated with emotional valence and arousal through a crowdsourcing experiment. We used a sound event detection (SED) and soundscape emotion recognition (SER) models with transfer learning to predict the perceived emotion of WCMED and CCMED. The results show that both SER and SED models could be used to analyze Chinese and Western classical music. The fact that SER and SED work better on Chinese classical music emotion recognition provides evidence that certain similarities exist between Chinese classical music and soundscape recordings, which permits transferability between machine learning models.",

      "text": "A soundscape recording is \"a recording of the sounds at a given locale at a given time, obtained with one or more fixed or moving microphones\"  [1] . While sound designers use soundscape recordings for sound design in movies and games, soundscapes are also important for compositions. When studying classical music, we found both Chinese and Western classical music are referring to the concept of soundscape  [2] [3] [4] [5] . Lüshi Chunqiu, an encyclopedic Chinese classic text compiled around 239 BC, describes songs that were composed based on birds' voices  [2] . The book Yue Ji says, \"Music is created by nature\"  [3] . Debussy was inspired by the soundscape in nature for his compositions  [4] . Researchers found fractal geometry in bird songs, Bach and Mozart's music  [5] .\n\nIn this study, we aim to investigate whether we can analyze Chinese and Western classical music using deep learning models originally built for soundscape recordings. Typically, such a model is not suitable for music because highlevel music information, such as harmony, melody, and orchestration, are not learned by the model. However, since both Chinese and Western classical music literature mention the concept of soundscape  [2] [3] [4] [5] , we intended to test whether such models can analyze Chinese and Western classical music.\n\nA sound event detection (SED) system recognizes sound events in audio signals  [6] . Soundscape emotion recognition (SER) is using computational methods for recognizing the perceived emotion of soundscape recordings  [7] . We use a pretrained SED and SER models as feature extractors and use the extracted features as inputs to support vector regression (SVR) models. The goal is to predict the perceived emotion of a corpus of 400 Western classical music excerpts (WCMED) and 400 Chinese classical music excerpts (CCMED). WCMED and CCMED were annotated with perceived valence and arousal via a crowdsourcing method. We examined the accuracy in predicting the perceived emotion of Western and Chinese classical music based on soundscape models.\n\nTo further investigate the differences between Western and Chinese classical music, we did a classification task based on a classifier trained on WCMED and CCMED. Moreover, feature analysis is performed to further our understanding of acoustic characteristics of Chinese and Western classical music when compared to soundscape recordings. Our evaluations show the better transferability between soundscape models and CCMED than WCMED. This implies certain level of similarities existing between Chinese classical music and soundscape recordings. The contributions are four-fold:",

      "text": "Previous studies discuss two types of emotions are at play when listening to music  [8, 9] . Perceived emotions are emotions communicated by the source. For example, the perceived emotion of happy songs is \"happy\". Induced emotions are reactions that the source provokes in listeners. Namely, induced emotion is what listeners' feel. A listener might feel happy when listening to sad music. We focus on perceived emotions. There are two families of models of emotion: categorical and dimensional models. Categorical models describe emotions using a set of terms, such as happiness, sadness, fear, anger and disgust. In contrast, dimensional models represent emotions across dimensions in a continuous space. For example, Russell's circumplex model uses a two-dimensional plane: arousal and valence, which represent the level of activation and the level of pleasantness respectively  [10] . We use Russell's circumplex model in this study.",

Most MER studies have focused on Western music  [14, 15] . Few MER studies have compared Chinese and Western music. Wu and Xie experimented with Chinese and Western classical MER by collecting annotations of 20 Western classical music pieces and 20 Chinese classical music pieces and training a Bayesian network for MER  [16] . The performance of Western classical MER is better than Chinese classical MER. Researchers have also compared Chinese and Western pop songs. Fan and Casey performed Chinese and UK hit song prediction using 40 weeks of data from pop music charts  [17] . They found danceability, energy, tempo and speechiness of UK hits are significantly higher than those of Chinese hits. Later, Yang et al. employed an automatic music tagging system and analyzed tags for the top-50 hits and found Western hits have more diverse genres  [18] . Hu and Yang examined the cross-dataset and cross-cultural generalizability of MER models for Western and Chinese Pop songs  [19] . They trained MER models with songs in one dataset and tested with those in the other. The results show that within-dataset predictions outperformed cross-dataset predictions in general  [19] .",

Our Western classical music recordings are chosen from the Saarland dataset consisting of royalty free audio recordings of 200 pieces and movements from the Western classical music repertoire  [20] . The instrumentation is diverse so as to cover various timbres. The instruments performed in these pieces include piano, violin, viola, cello, double-bass, flutes, trumpets, trombone, and xylophone, etc. Excerpts in CCMED are collected from a popular Chinese music-streaming platform  [21] . The instruments performed in these pieces include guqin (a plucked seven-string instrument), xun (a globular, vessel flute), pipa (a four-stringed instrument), bianzhong (chime-bells), di (Chinese flute), xiao (a vertical flute), and zheng (Chinese zither), etc.\n\nThe duration of each excerpt is 8-20 seconds. This is determined by the recommended duration  [14, 22] , and balancing the completeness of a phrase and the homogeneity of the timbre of an excerpt. In WCMED, the average duration is 12.41 seconds; the standard deviation is 2.74 seconds. In CCMED, the average duration is 13.07 seconds; the standard deviation is 2.89 seconds. All excerpts are converted to a format in WAV (44,100 Hz sampling frequency, 32 bits precision and mono channel).",

      "text": "We conducted two crowdsourcing experiments to collect emotional annotations (arousal and valence) for WCMED and CCMED individually. Regarding the annotations, we used a ranking-based method. Instead of providing absolute ratings, participants do pairwise comparisons by deciding which audio excerpt has higher arousal/valence. This method simplifies the annotation process, and enhances the inter-annotator reliability  [23] . We use a Quicksort algorithm to create pairwise comparisons iteratively. For the first iteration, we select one excerpt as the pivot. All remaining excerpts are to be compared with the pivot. For each comparison, we collect 3 annotations and determine the result to be the one that was provided by at least two annotators. After the first iteration, we end up having two separate sets. We then select a pivot in each subset and create new pairwise comparisons. Eventually, we rank all the excerpts. This method has been used in previous studies  [12, 23] . We launched separate crowdsourcing studies for valence and arousal on a platform called Figure Eight  [24] . First, annotators read a tutorial, which explains the concept of valence and arousal. Second, annotators take a quiz, which contains 5 gold standard hand-selected comparisons. These pairs are easily comparable regarding valence and arousal. Annotators need to achieve 70% of accuracy in the quiz to continue the task. During the actual annotation task, we tracked their performance by inserting similar gold standard comparisons. Annotators need to provide correct answers to continue the study. An audio excerpt can be played repeatedly. Annotators were required to use headphones during the study. The volume control bar was disabled so that annotators could not adjust the individual volumes. To train regression models, we convert the rankings to ratings. We map the range of ranking values, 1 to 400, to a corresponding rating range of 1.0 to -1.0. This procedure has two assumptions. First, the valence and arousal are in the range of [1.0, -1.0]. Second, the distances between two successive rankings are equal.\n\nA total of 989 annotators from 21 countries participated in the study. We evaluate the Inter-annotator reliability based on percent agreement and Krippendorff's alpha. The percent agreement indicates that annotators agreed on 77.3% (arousal) and 76.1% (valence) of comparisons. The values of Krippendorff's alpha are between 0.21 to 0.40, which indicate a fair level of agreement.",

The difference between WCMED and CCMED regarding predicting arousal is not statistically significant. But, there was a significant difference (p<0.001) for valence. In general, the VGGish model works much better on WCMED and CCMED when predicting arousal than predicting valence.\n\nPrevious studies indicate arousal is easier to predict  [7, 14] . For both soundscape and music, arousal is determined by the level of eventfulness and activation. In contrast, valence of soundscape is mainly determined by the timbre  [7]  and valence of music is represented by high-level information such as harmony, melody, and orchestration  [14] . An SED model does not consider the latter information. The fact that R 2 < 0 when predicting valence for WCMED indicates the model is worse than using the average value as the prediction. However, the VGGish model works better on CCMED (R 2 : 0.318). Moreover, the VGGish model was trained on AudioSet  [25] , which contains Western classical music but no Chinese classical music. VGGish model works even better on CCMED than WCMED which implies there are certain similarities existing between Chinese classical music and soundscape recordings.",

Since the sample rate of each excerpt is 44,100 Hz, one augmented data point represents about 1.86 seconds of an audio file.

Ten percent of the training set is used as a validation set to select the best mode according to the validation loss within 100 epochs. The binary classification accuracy is 91.93%.

      "text": "To further study the acoustic characteristics of Chinese and Western classical music and soundscape recordings, we conducted a regression analysis with four feature sets on the three datasets. We adopt Essentia to extract features including loudness, rhythm, tonal and timbre. Loudness describes the sensation of intensity of sound. Rhythm depicts the tempo or pulse of a music piece. Tonal features include pitch and harmony. Pitch is the perceptual frequency of sound that can be ordered on a scale from low to high. Harmony refers to the relationship between simultaneously occurring pitches. Timbre refers to the texture of sound that is used to judge whether two sounds having the same loudness and pitch are dissimilar  [19] .\n\nThe number of dimensions of each feature set is shown in the first row of Table  3 . We adopted SVR with the linear kernel to investigate features. The parameter C was optimized by grid searches. We conducted feature selection using the recursive feature elimination (RFE). RFE selects features by recursively removing the least important features from the current feature set until the desired number of features is reached. Moreover, we set the ranging of the number of features from 1 to total dimensions and select the best model.\n\nWe examine the performance of using four feature sets separately and together. We did 10-times cross-validation and presented the average performance (R 2 ) of the validation set. The performances are shown in Table  3  and 4 . For both arousal and valence, the loudness feature set performs well for all three datasets. This corresponds to the finds in previous studies  [7, 19] . Whereas rhythmic features perform better for arousal prediction of WCMED and valence prediction of CCMED, a paired t-test shows it is not significant.\n\nTable  3  shows that pitch and harmony can describe level of intensity and eventfulness of CCMED, but that is not the case for WCMED. According to Table  4 , when predicting valence, pitch and harmony are more important for WCMED whereas the texture of the sound is more important for CCMED. Moreover, for valence and arousal prediction, timbre features work significantly better on both CCMED and soundscape than WCMED. This might imply soundscape models extract feature embeddings that better describe tonal and timbre, which are also important for Chinese classical music.",
