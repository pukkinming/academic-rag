      "text": "In recent years, deep-learning-based speech emotion recognition models have outperformed classical machine learning models. Previously, some neural network designs, such as Multitask Learning, have accounted for variations in emotional expressions due to demographic and contextual factors. However, existing models face a few constraints: 1) they rely on a clear definition of domains (e.g. gender, culture, noise condition, etc.) and the availability of domain labels. 2) they often attempt to learn domain-invariant features while emotion expressions can be domain-specific. In the present study, we propose the Nonparametric Hierarchical Neural Network (NHNN), a lightweight hierarchical neural network model based on Bayesian nonparametric clustering. In comparison to Multitask Learning approaches, the proposed model does not require domain/task labels. In our experiments, the NHNN models outperform the models with similar levels of complexity and state-of-the-art models in within-corpus and crosscorpus tests. Through clustering analysis, we show that the NHNN models are able to learn group-specific features and bridge the performance gap between groups.",

      "text": "Emotion can greatly influence people's mental processes and behaviors and is also a predictor of physical and psychological well being. Speech Emotion Recognition (SER) has become an important research topic in human-computer interaction.\n\nAlthough considerable research effort has been put into developing models capable of recognizing and predicting human emotions, much of the work focuses on lab-produced datasets  [3]  and robust speech emotion recognition on in-thewild speech with diverse confounding acoustic elements remains a challenge  [32] . Previous work has used a variety of machine learning techniques such as multi-task learning  [32]  and domain generalization  [31]  that attempt to learn a more robust and generalizable representation of speech features, yet few studies have successfully accounted for variations in speech emotion corpora due to the complexity of emotion expressions and a variety of moderating variables such as gender, culture, etc.\n\nIn this paper, we propose a novel lightweight architecture based on unsupervised non-parametric clustering and supervised convolutional neural networks (CNN) in order to account for inter-group differences in emotional expressions. We test the model on both lab-produced and in-the-wild speech emotion datasets and show our proposed model outperforms stateof-the-art methods on most within-corpus and cross-corpus tests. Our work has the potential to achieve robust SER performances in groups with a variety of emotional expressions.",

Past research has experimented with different machine learning algorithms, such as Hidden Markov Models (HMM)  [16] , Artificial Neural Networks (ANN)  [4] , Support Vector Machines (SVM)  [10] . In recent years, deep learning approaches have become more popular and have reached state-of-the-art performances on SER  [9] . For instance, Zhao et al. proposed the CNN-LSTM model, which showed better accuracy than conventional CNN and LSTM models  [33] .

      "section_name": "Acoustic Features And Variations",
      "text": "A considerable amount of research from the speech signal processing community has explored relevant acoustic features for SER  [27] . Some common features used for classifications often include prosody features, such as pitch and loudness, voice quality features, such as the first three formants and the signal-to-noise ratio, and spectral features, such as the Melfrequency Cepstral Coefficients (MFCC) and Linear Prediction Cepstral Coefficients (LPCC).\n\nHowever, robustly extracting emotion from these acoustic features can be quite challenging. The relationship between experienced emotions and observed acoustic features can be moderated by multiple contextual and demographic factors. These variations create challenges for robust automatic speech recognition systems. One source of variations is environmental conditions. In-the-wild speech is often recorded with different recording devices, producing different sound qualities. A variety of background noise, such as other human speech and music, can also introduce noise into the extracted acoustic features. Additionally, researchers have shown that the experience of emotion and its expressions are often influenced by biological, social, and cultural factors. Kring and Gordon found that, when presented with emotional stimuli, female participants were more expressive than male participants, even though they reported the same type and intensity of experienced emotions  [13] . Matsumoto et al. found that cultural display rules differ systematically between Japan and the United States  [17] . Gender differences have also been well documented in SER applications. For instance, Alghowinem et al. found that best features for depression detection from speech differed across genders  [26] .\n\nDespite advances in speech emotion recognition systems, few model designs have properly accounted for these factors. One popular approach is to partition audio segments to be part of a certain domain, such as gender, corpus, noise condition, etc., and apply domain adaptation  [30]  or multi-task learning during training  [32] . Some have trained separate models on each domain and then applied model fusion in a later stage  [24] . However, one key assumption of such approaches is that there exist pre-specified domains for audio. For human speech, the domains can be non-exhaustive. For instance, gender, race, language, age, environmental conditions are all possible criteria for categorization, yet a combination of these criteria would generate an exponential amount of permutations with multiple labels (e.g. Male, Caucasian, adult, etc.). Training separate models for each permutation or applying domain adaptation among such a large number of domains are simply impractical.\n\nIn addition, the goal of domain adaptation approaches is to find some shared representation that exists across domains. However, some acoustic features may be domain-specific. Past research has shown that negative transfer can occur where transfer methods decrease performances  [28] .\n\nLast but not least, working with pre-specified domains assumes sufficient information about the corpus. However, when training on in-the-wild speech or real-world speech recordings, researchers often don't have explicit and perfect knowledge on subjects' demographics or speech recording conditions, and many of these labels may be incomplete.\n\nIn the present study, we introduce the Bayesian Nonparametric method (BNP) as a way to account for acoustic variations. Our proposed method offers a more flexible alternative than Multi-task Learning or domain adaptation as it captures the latent structure of the dataset through unsupervised means and does not rely on any additional labels except ground-truth emotion categories. The number of domains can grow as new data becomes available. The Bayesian nonparametric (BNP) method was first proposed by Ferguson  [8] , who introduced the Dirichlet process, denoted as DP(𝛼 0 , 𝐺 0 ), where 𝛼 0 is the scaling parameter, and 𝐺 0 is the probability measure. An explicit formulation was provided by Sethuraman  [25]  with the famous \"stick-breaking construction\", which uses an independent sequence of i.i.d. random variables 𝜷 = (𝛽 1 , 𝛽 2 , ...) and components 𝝓 = (𝜙 1 , 𝜙 2 , ...) where",

The clustering of the audio is based on eGeMAPS feature vectors and the MFB features are passed into the feature encoder and emotion classifier. Both eGeMAPS and MFB features are commonly used in SER work and will be introduced in detail in Section 4.5.

In particular, we look at the gender ratio, language ratio, subject audio distribution, and mood severity in each mixture. In the R21 dataset, we also analyze the proportion of audio segments from native English speakers in the mixtures. As gender and native-language are binary variables in our study, we simply compare the ratio of the two attributes in a dataset/mixture. The gender ratio is defined as the number of female audio segments divided by the number of male audio segments. The language ratio is calculated by dividing the number of audio segments from native English speakers from those from nonnative speakers. As for subjects, there are great variations in the number of audio segments belonged to each subject in each dataset while the mixtures are of different sizes. To analyze the distributions of subject_id, we divide the maximum number of audio segments belonged to a single subject by the minimum number as a surrogate of the dispersion of subject audio segments in a dataset/mixture. If the clustering is not based on a certain attribute, we would expect the relevant ratios to be similar in cluster 1, cluster 2, and the dataset as a whole.\n\nIn the R21 dataset, the clusters seem to be indicative of subjects' demographics, where gender ratio difference and native-language language difference are observed between the two clusters.

This suggests that the low R21 withincorpus performance relative to PRIORI Emotion is likely due to a lack of training samples.\n\nIn the cluster analysis, we show that the clustering criteria vary depending on the dataset, which may be a combination of higher-level attributes or lower-level acoustic features. subsequent analysis also confirms that the performance improvement of the NHNN models tend to be different depending on domains. In Experiment 1, we found that the performance improvement on one gender is significantly better than the other when the dataset has gender imbalances in utterances and the clustering is partially based on gender. When the clustering is not based on gender, and the gender ratio is close to 1, as is the case for IEMOCAP, the model showed a similar performance increase for both genders. This implies that the clustering-based approach has an effect on the model performance on some selective gender-related data with local characteristics that are not properly accounted for in a general CNN model when there is a gender imbalance. Through clustering, we build customized classifiers for each mixture component to account for these variations, while using a shared feature encoder to preserve group-invariant characteristics. Compared with a typical blackbox machine learning algorithm, our proposed model and subsequent analysis provide a more intuitive and explainable approach.\n\nIn addition to performance, compared with multi-tasking learning, which has a similar training time and model complexity, our model is more flexible as it does not require any group labels for training and achieves better within-corpus and cross-corpus performances with statistical significance.\n\nLastly, as much of the emotional experiences, expressions and perceptions are biologically, socially and culturally dependent, the ability to understand and account for domain-specific characteristics is crucial in building equitable SER systems for in-the-wild speech by speakers from all backgrounds. The NHNN model has the potential of accounting for variations and reducing model biases. Future studies can explore in detail how the clustering of acoustic features is related to sources of variation. This will help us better understand domain-specific features in speech emotion expressions. In our experiments, we used a standard DPMM with a full set of eGeMAPS features. Future studies can conduct feature selection and regularization techniques to test different variants of NHNN.",
