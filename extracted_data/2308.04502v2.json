      "text": "It has been a hot research topic to enable machines to understand human emotions in multimodal contexts under dialogue scenarios, which is tasked with multimodal emotion analysis in conversation (MM-ERC). MM-ERC has received consistent attention in recent years, where a diverse range of methods has been proposed for securing better task performance. Most existing works treat MM-ERC as a standard multimodal classification problem and perform multimodal feature disentanglement and fusion for maximizing feature utility. Yet after revisiting the characteristic of MM-ERC, we argue that both the feature multimodality and conversational contextualization should be properly modeled simultaneously during the feature disentanglement and fusion steps. In this work, we target further pushing the task performance by taking full consideration of the above insights. On the one hand, during feature disentanglement, based on the contrastive learning technique, we devise a Dual-level Disentanglement Mechanism (DDM) to decouple the features into both the modality space and utterance space. On the other hand, during the feature fusion stage, we propose a Contribution-aware Fusion Mechanism (CFM) and a Context Refusion Mechanism (CRM) for multimodal and context integration, * Fei Li is the corresponding author.",

      "text": "The analysis of conversational emotions  [47]  has received growing attention and has been applied in various downstream tasks, like empathetic response generation  [13, 24, 55]  and mental disease treatment  [48] . Recently, the research on conversational emotion analysis has extended the focus from text to multiple modalities such as video and audio  [16, 25, 47] . As illustrated in Figure  1 , There was hum... There was another reason that I thought it was time to end it with Joey. (Neutral) Figure  1 : An example of multimodal conversation from the MELD dataset  [47] . Each utterance comes with three modalities of content: video, audio, and text. The goal of MM-ERC is to recognize the emotion label of each utterance. multimodal emotion recognition in conversation (named MM-ERC) aims to detect the emotion label for each utterance in a given dialogue by jointly considering auditory, visual, and textual content. The introduction of audio and video compensates for the limitation of solely depending on text features and thus enriches the features used for emotion recognition.\n\nA good number of efforts have been devoted to building effective MM-ERC models and secured promising performance, where the core idea is to effectively disentangle different modalities and then properly fuse them so as to maximize the efficacy of multimodal features for the task  [9, 21, 23, 25, 60] . However, MM-ERC intrinsically involves two simultaneous key ingredients: multiple feature modality and conversational contextualization. While the majority of existing models treat MM-ERC as a typical multimodal classification problem, focusing predominantly on either multimodality or context modeling, the relationship between dialogue context and multimodal feature consistency is often neglected. By revisiting the task of MM-ERC, we note that a sound and effective MM-ERC system should place proper attention to simultaneously modeling the multimodality and contextualization during the feature disentanglement step and fusion step.\n\nFeature Disentanglement. The purpose of feature disentanglement is to extract the critical features from the original feature spaces and weaken the influence of irrelevant features, since multimodal inputs often contain features unrelated to emotion recognition (e.g., background video and noisy audio). While existing models, such as MISA  [20]  and FDMER  [57] , propose sophisticated disentanglement mechanisms for single pieces of utterance, disentangling on the conversational contexts has not been considered. On the one hand, different modality features within one utterance should exhibit similarities because, intuitively, multimodal signals under the same utterance can be semantically consistent in representing an identical emotion. On the other hand, features from different utterances with the same modality share similarities in modality-specific characteristics (e.g., timbre, facial expression, and strong wording), which may seem trivial for other modalities but are useful for recognizing emotions in the specific modality space. Feature disentanglement without effectively considering both the modality level and utterance level will inevitably limit further performance improvement of MM-ERC. Unfortunately, to the best of our knowledge, no existing research explores the disentanglement under these two aspects, indicating a potential research gap.\n\nFeature Fusion. The disentangled features from the above step further need to be properly fused, during which reasonable weights are assigned to maximize the utility of features for emotion prediction. Since different clues in varied modalities serve distinct contributions to the final prediction, fusing features across modalities has been extensively considered in existing MM-ERC studies  [9, 10, 21, 25] , with many sophisticated methods, such as tensor fusion  [60] , graph convolutional networks  [25] , gating mechanisms  [21] . However, no controllable weights were utilized in previous works, which may risk one modality dominating the multimodal fusion process  [45]  and potentially limiting the overall performance. Yet we note that the utterance-level fusion should also receive sufficient attention. Intuitively, it is less necessary to further introduce moderate history utterance contexts for prediction when the multimodal signals within the current utterance have indicated a clear emotion tendency in high consistency. Instead, aggressively feeding all the historical contexts would rather deteriorate the inference. For example, in Figure  1 , fully considering all previous dialogue contexts might lead to an incorrect emotion determination for the last utterance as \"Sadness\". This could happen due to the negative neighbor context (i.e., the emotion of the second-last utterance being \"Sadness\") and the negative atmosphere conveyed throughout the dialogue. Therefore, properly fusing the features from both multimodal ones and dialogue contexts is non-trivial.\n\nIn light of the above observations, in this work, we develop a niche targeting solution, i.e., DF-ERC (Disentanglement & Fusion for Emotion Recognition in Conversation), to fill the gaps and help achieve higher performance in MM-ERC. As shown in Figure 2, our system comprises four tiers. First, the raw multimodal inputs of dialogues are encoded into various feature extractors to obtain corresponding features. Then, the feature disentanglement layer performs feature disentanglement, where a Dual-level Disentanglement Mechanism (DDM) is proposed. DDM employs contrastive learning  [14]  to push the feature vectors of different modalities or different utterances away, thereby disentangling features at the modality level and utterance level, respectively. Next, the feature fusion layer performs modality-level and context-level integration, in which we propose a Contribution-aware Fusion Mechanism (CFM) and a Context Refusion Mechanism (CRM) for multimodal and context fusion, respectively. CFM fuses multimodal features based on the true classification probabilities  [11]  of each modality as their contributions, where such dynamic weighting advances in more controllable feature coordination. In contrast, CRM flexibly schedules the introduction of historical dialogue contexts into the current utterance via a novel emotion-prototype learning strategy. Specifically, CRM calculates the consistency degree of all modality features within an utterance, where a lower  consistency degree triggers the model to bring in more contexts for reassurance. Finally, the fused overall multimodal and contextual features are used for the emotion label prediction.\n\nTo evaluate the efficacy of our proposed approach, we performed extensive experiments on two widely-used benchmarks, namely MELD  [47]  and IEMOCAP  [6] . DF-ERC achieves state-of-the-art performance on overall results and most of the fine-grained emotion categories, demonstrating its effectiveness and stability. Furthermore, we find that DDM was able to effectively disentangle the features of different modalities or utterances (see Figure  10 ), and the disentangled features played a crucial role in the process of feature fusion (see Figure  6  and Figure  7 ). Additionally, both CFM and CRM play vital roles, as demonstrated by ablation studies (see Table  2 ) and in-depth analysis (see Section 4.4). Especially noteworthy is that CRM outperforms the models with no context or full context engagement, demonstrating its superiority (see Figure  8 ).\n\nOverall, our contributions are four-fold:\n\n• We revisit the MM-ERC task and, for the first time, propose DF-ERC to enhance the task by performing disentanglement and fusion under both the modality and context perspectives.\n\n• Technically, we propose three novel and effective mechanisms to disentangle and fuse both multimodal and contextual features. • Empirically, our system achieves state-of-the-art performance on two benchmarks. • Our proposed methods have great potential for facilitating a broader range of conversational multimodal applications.",

      "text": "Multimodal sentiment analysis  [12, 44, 56]  aims to extract sentiments or emotions using multiple modality resources, such as text (transcripts), acoustic (audio) and visual modalities. However, discrepancies across different modalities pose a challenge to the model. To address this issue, some studies have focused on modality alignment  [52]  and minimizing the discrepancies between modalities  [39, 59] . Moreover, the style of modality fusion can impact the model performance, leading to the exploration of effective fusion methods, such as hierarchical mutual information  [18, 41] , reconstruct loss  [20] , and graph neural network  [2, 27, 58] . Additionally, leveraging contextual information to predict dynamic emotions is also a popular approach  [1, 7, 8, 15] . However, the use of controllable weights to fuse multimodal features has not been considered in any of the existing approaches, which can limit their performance in practice and is one of the main focuses of our study. Emotion Recognition in Conversation (ERC)  [32, 40, 46]  is a subfield of affective computing that aims to recognize emotions for each utterance within a conversation. To develop the model, some studies focus on leveraging dialogue-related features, such as speaker-oriented dialogue modeling  [17, 22, 42] , context-aware modeling  [50, 63] , hierarchical feature modeling  [31, 34, 35] , and emotion transition  [4, 51] . With the development of multimodal technology  [3, 29, 62] , the research scope of ERC has been extended to multimodal scenarios. Many studies have explored multimodal fusion methods for the MM-ERC task, such as multimodal dynamic fusion  [21, 36] , hierarchical fusion  [10] , and adaptive modality drop  [9] . Although existing adaptive methods have been proposed, they neglect some crucial aspects, such as the contribution of each utterance and the relationship between modality consistency and the involvement of context, which are the main focuses of our paper.",

      "text": "Except for fusing multimodal features, contextual feature fusion is also important, especially when multimodal features contradict each other regarding emotion prediction. Therefore, we compute the agreements among multimodal features as the weights to determine how many contextual features should be incorporated. However, since multimodal features are not aligned according to emotions, it may be inaccurate to directly compute the similarity based on multimodal features. To solve this problem, we propose a prototype-based alignment module (as shown in Figure  5 ) to learn the emotion-specific representations of multimodal features. Specifically, in each training epoch, we maintain a prototype vector for each kind of emotion:\n\nwhere 𝑅 𝑘 𝑡 represents the prototype of the 𝑘-th emotion in the 𝑡-th epoch,\n\nis the size of the 𝑘-th emotion in the 𝑟 -th round.

      "text": "To further investigate the effectiveness of DF-ERC, we conduct in-depth analyses to answer the following questions:\n\nQ1: How does utterance-level feature disentanglement influence the feature fusion process? We analyzed the influence of utterance-level disentanglement on context weight and final performance. As shown in Figure  6 , we divided all instances into five groups based on the similarities between modalities, sorted in ascending order. From the similarity curve, we found that the use of utterance-level disentanglement can significantly improve the similarities between modalities within an utterance, demonstrating that it effectively captures utterance-level information. Furthermore, we observed that utterance-level disentanglement is more effective in the case of utterances with a lower similarity between modalities (demonstrated by the larger F1 score gap). This is because low similarity often indicates that the features of the utterance are not fully exploited, and adding utterance-level disentanglement brings the utterance-level distance closer, thus improving similarity to a greater extent. Finally, considering the F1 metric, utterance-level disentanglement contributes more to the performance of utterances with low similarities, indicating that it can improve the final performance by leveraging utterance-level similarity.\n\nQ2: How does modality-level feature disentanglement influence the feature fusion process? We analyzed the effect of modality-level feature disentanglement on the weight of each modality and the final F1 score. From the curves depicted in Figure  7 , it is evident that integrating modality disentanglement resulted in increased weights for the video and audio modalities, especially in utterances with higher cross-entropy values. This can be attributed to the fact that modality disentanglement enables each modality's unique characteristics to be fully exploited, resulting in a subtle enhancement of weaker modalities, such as video and audio. Moreover, this increase of weight for weaker modalities is more evident in utterances with suboptimal prediction results, where the text modality does not perform well. We observed the most substantial improvement in the F1 score for utterances with poorer prediction results, approximately 5 points improvement for those with cross-entropy ranking percentile > 0.75. This suggests that the integration of modality-level feature disentanglement can lead to more accurate predictions in challenging situations.\n\nQ3: Do the CRM context weights decided by modality consistency really work? To verify the effectiveness of the modality similarity comparison module, we study the relationship between prediction performance and modality similarity. Additionally, we include the performance under full weight (incorporating all context representations) and zero weight (excluding all context representations). Figure  8  displays these results, with the x-axis representing the instance's similarity score ranking among all instances, while larger x values denote higher similarity. Firstly, we find that as modality similarity improves, the overall performance of the model also increases gradually. This is because the more similar the three modalities are, the more consistency they exhibit in emotion recognition, resulting in higher prediction scores. Secondly, when comparing full weight to zero weight, we observe that for utterances with relatively small similarities, the performance of full weight is superior to that of zero weight. This is because when the discrepancy between different modalities within an utterance is substantial, introducing context utterance representations can help to better recognize emotions. Conversely, as similarity increases and the discrepancy between different modalities diminishes, context representations interfere with emotional judgments. Thus, for the latter    8 : Correlation between performance and modality consistency, where a larger value of the x-axis represents a higher modality consistency. We use similarity to represent consistency, where a higher similarity of different modalities indicates a higher consistency. CRM: Our proposed Context Refusion Mechanism dynamically determines how much contextual features are used based on modality consistency; Zero: using no contextual features; Full: using 100% contextual features.\n\nhalf of the figures, the performance score of zero weight outperforms that of full weight. Finally, regardless of whether full weight or zero weight is used, both approaches have limitations in that they can not be flexibly adjusted as the consistency of modalities. Our CRM can adjust context weight according to the consistency between modalities, achieving the best performance in all instances and verifying that DF-ERC effectively captures the relationship between multimodal features and context features.",

The result  indicates that modality-level contrastive learning effectively disentangles the three modalities from each other. Furthermore, we also observe that utterance-level disentanglement can align features within an utterance by entangling features from three distinct modality spaces. These findings highlight the effectiveness of our DDM in controlling the modality distribution in feature space based on the corresponding optimization objective and thus can further improve the emotion recognition performance.\n\nThe contribution of CFM for final performance. To verify the effect of CFM, we investigated the relationship between the prediction effect (evaluated using MSE) of TCP and the final emotion recognition performance. Figure  11  shows that for the majority of utterances, the MSE of the TCP prediction is less than 0.1, indicating satisfactory performance for TCP. However, it should be noted that a better TCP prediction for each modality does not necessarily result in a higher emotion prediction score, as shown by the wave pattern in the bottom half of the figure, which suggests that TCP has some limitations as a modality contribution evaluator. Nonetheless, after averaging the prediction MSE of the three modalities within an utterance, we observed a gradual increase in performance with a smoother tendency as the MSE decreased. This demonstrates that, overall, a predicted contribution weight can guide the model to assign the optimal weight for each modality and thus achieve better final performance.",
