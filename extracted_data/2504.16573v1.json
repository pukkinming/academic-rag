      "text": "Psychological counseling is increasingly recognized as a crucial service amid the growing global prevalence of mental health disorders, yet the field continues to face significant resource constraints, notably shortages of trained therapists  [2] . To bridge this gap, artificial intelligence (AI) technologies, particularly AI chatbots and automated systems, have been widely explored and implemented to support or even partially replace traditional counseling practices  [4]   [7] . However, these approaches frequently aim at substituting therapists with conversational agents, which introduces significant ethical concerns, including the lack of empathy, potential biases, and insufficient personalization  [11] .\n\nRecent research highlights the limitations of existing AI-based counseling systems, specifically their inability to adequately understand nuanced human emotions, respond empathically, and address individual differences in emotional expression  [7] . Moreover, current solutions rarely consider the needs of therapists who require effective, reliable tools to enhance their clinical workflows and reduce administrative burdens, while also safeguarding clients' privacy  [2] .\n\nIn response to these gaps, we introduce PsyCounAssist, a novel AI-powered full-cycle psychological counseling assistant system designed explicitly to support, rather than replace, therapists and their clients. Our system focuses on three distinct yet interconnected modules aligned with actual counseling scenarios: real-time emotion prediction (REP), automated structured session reporting (ASSR), and personalized follow-up support (PFS).\n\nPsyCounAssist leverages a multimodal fusion approach combining speech and photoplethysmography (PPG) signals, thereby significantly enhancing the accuracy of real-time emotion recognition compared to traditional unimodal methods  [8]   [5] . Beyond realtime emotional monitoring, PsyCounAssist integrates an innovative session documentation system powered by large language models (LLMs), automating the structured reporting process and substantially decreasing therapists' documentation workloads. Additionally, our system provides a personalized conversational agent that supports clients between counseling sessions. Clients can choose between general or individualized chatbots, the latter leveraging previous session insights to deliver more tailored emotional support and self-help interventions.\n\nCritically, PsyCounAssist emphasizes ethical considerations and privacy protection. Unlike conventional AI counseling systems, our design explicitly allows emotional monitoring without obligatory audio recording or transcription, thus ensuring clients' confidentiality and data security  [2] .\n\nIn summary, the primary contributions of this work include: (1) proposing PsyCounAssist, a novel system designed explicitly as a therapist-support tool rather than a replacement, addressing key ethical and practical limitations of existing approaches; (2) introducing an advanced multimodal fusion method for emotion recognition that combines speech and PPG signals to enhance accuracy and privacy protection; and (3) demonstrating practical, deployable tools such as automated structured reporting and personalized follow-up support, aimed at significantly improving therapeutic efficiency and client engagement.",

      "text": "AI-Assisted Mental Health Counseling. In recent years, artificial intelligence (AI) has been successfully applied across various domains, including image recognition and text analysis, progressively merging with psychology to address practical challenges. Within psychological research, AI applications predominantly focus on affective computing, leveraging multi-source data to predict emotional states, valence levels, or mental health indicators. In mental health counseling, notable implementations include chatbot systems and diagnostic recommendation tools designed to simulate certain aspects of human counselor interactions. For instance, PsyDT  [10]  employs large-scale corpora emulating professional therapists' conversational styles to train large language models (LLMs), effectively replicating specific counseling dialogues and interaction logic. Similarly, XiaoIce  [12] , an AI-based companionship system, provides emotional support through everyday conversations tailored to user preferences, accommodating sustained emotional engagement. However, despite significant progress, these systems generally fail to integrate seamlessly into actual counseling practices, neglecting the intrinsic human-to-human empathetic interaction essential to effective psychological counseling. Hence, constructing supportive rather than substitutive AI systems is vital to genuinely empower psychological counseling. Additionally, real-world counseling sessions often involve privacy concerns and expression constraints, leading clients to resist providing complete textual or facial data. Thus, incorporating non-verbal cues as a low-intrusiveness supplement to assist therapists in real-time emotional detection becomes imperative.\n\nMultimodal Emotion Recognition in Mental Health. Multimodal modeling, particularly combining speech and physiological signals, is becoming mainstream for non-invasive, real-time emotion recognition in psychological applications. In speech-based emotion recognition, significant advancements such as the Emotion2Vec model have demonstrated outstanding performance on multimodal datasets like RECOLA  [9] , achieving state-of-the-art Weighted Accuracy (WA) of 79.4 %, making it suitable for dynamic assessment and real-time assistance during therapy sessions. Regarding physiological signals, photoplethysmography (PPG) has emerged as a practical, wearable approach extensively used for emotion recognition. PPGderived features, including heart rate (HR) and heart rate variability (HRV), are strongly correlated with autonomic nervous system activities, effectively indicating fluctuations in anxiety, stress, and other emotional states. These physiological indicators provide reliable data for developing non-invasive multimodal emotion recognition systems. Hence, future psychological counseling AI systems should transition from single-modal simulations toward multimodal fusion approaches, significantly enhancing their capacity to perceive and understand complex human emotional behaviors.\n\nLLM-based Automated Counseling Support. Large language models (LLMs), such as GPT-4, have demonstrated exceptional reasoning and summarization capabilities in language understanding and generation tasks, making them highly suitable for structuring and summarizing counseling session content. Typically, counselors must manually document key conversational insights, a process prone to omission and inefficiency. Automated structured documentation from session recordings substantially reduces counselor workload, enhancing productivity and service quality. Current leading LLMs, including GPT-4, excel in extracting critical information from lengthy counseling sessions (45-60 minutes) and generating organized summaries. Nonetheless, cloud-deployed models pose potential risks regarding user privacy, particularly sensitive within mental health contexts. To address privacy concerns, locally deployable open-source models like DeepSeek present more appropriate alternatives. These models facilitate voice transcription and structured conversation extraction without external servers, simultaneously ensuring privacy and intelligent performance, thus providing practical solutions for counseling support. Additionally, although companion AI systems like XiaoICE are not classified under formal psychological counseling, their emotional support role is significant. Advanced customization utilizing clients' historical counseling summaries and stylistic preferences could create familiar, personalized digital companions, aiding emotional continuity and psychological stability. Technologically, with client authorization, structured counseling records and tailored prompt engineering can generate personalized supportive content. Combined with advanced voice cloning models such as SparkTTS and Bark, these AI systems can emulate specific counselor voices, offering more authentic and trustworthy interactive experiences for clients.",

To accommodate varying session contexts and privacy considerations, the system flexibly supports emotion recognition based on speech signals, physiological signals (i.e., photoplethysmography, PPG), or their combination. The specific modality or fusion strategy is determined according to the client's informed consent and device availability.\n\nSpeech data is captured via in-room or pad microphones, while PPG signals are collected through wearable sensors such as wristbands. When both modalities are available and permitted, their outputs are integrated via a decision-level fusion mechanism to improve prediction robustness. This flexible configuration ensures broad applicability while aligning with ethical and privacy-preserving principles.",

      "text": "Speech-based Emotion Recognition. For the audio modality, we adopt Emotion2Vec  [6]  as the core emotion recognition model. The model projects speech segments into a continuous affective vector space and has demonstrated strong generalization across several public affective speech corpora. In our use case, the model is finetuned for three primary emotional classes: sad, neutral, and positive, which are aligned with typical affective states in therapeutic dialogue.\n\nThe audio processing pipeline includes: Voice Activity Detection (VAD): applied to segment effective speech intervals from ambient noise and silence; KMeans++ Clustering: used for unsupervised partitioning of speech segments, aiding in speaker differentiation; Speaker Attribution: achieved by comparing cluster characteristics with a pre-constructed database of counselor voice samples, allowing extraction of client-only speech for emotion inference.\n\nThis preprocessing ensures the downstream model focuses on client expressions, filtering out therapist utterances and irrelevant segments.\n\nPhysiological Modeling via PPG. To complement the limitations of speech signals-e.g., suppressed affect expression or deceptive tone-we incorporate photoplethysmography (PPG) as a secondary modality. PPG signals are acquired via non-invasive wrist-worn devices and analyzed in terms of: Heart Rate (HR),Heart Rate Variability (HRV).\n\nTo build a reliable mapping between physiological responses and emotional states, we design and implement a controlled emotion elicitation experiment. Participants are exposed to audiovisual stimuli curated to induce specific affective states (e.g., sadness, calmness), during which real-time PPG signals were collected. After each elicitation block, participants self-reported their experienced emotions using a valence-arousal grid, which served as ground truth for supervised learning.The collected data were then used to train a set of machine learning models (e.g., SVM, LightGBM) to classify emotional states based on HR and HRV features. This rule accounts for low-energy or ambiguous speech that may be misclassified as neutral while still containing affective signals (e.g., sadness).\n\nPPG-only Condition. Let 𝜇 𝑡 denote the mean SCR (skin conductance response) at time 𝑡, computed from GSR features derived from the PPG signal. We define a cumulative affect score 𝑆 𝑝 ∈ R, updated heuristically as:\n\nwhere 𝜆 is a fixed update constant (default: 0.5), 𝜃 is the SCR reactivity threshold (default: 0.3), and 𝑚 ∈ [0, 1] is a confidence coefficient.\n\nThe final emotional label is assigned as:\n\nwith 𝛿 1 = 1.0 by default.\n\nMulti-modal Condition. When both modalities are available, a weighted average is used to compute the final emotional distribution:\n\n, ∀𝑐 ∈ C Here, 𝑃 𝑡 𝑠 (𝑐) and 𝑃 𝑡 𝑝 (𝑐) are the class probabilities from speech and PPG models respectively, and 𝛼 ∈ [0, 1] is the fusion weight. In default settings:\n\n• 𝛼 = 0.7 when speech quality is high,\n\n• 𝛼 = 0.3 when speech is noisy or unavailable.\n\nThe final label is computed as ŷ𝑡 𝑓 = arg max 𝑐 𝑃 𝑡 𝑓 (𝑐).",
