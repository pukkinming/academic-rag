      "text": "Emotion Recognition in Conversations (ERC) presents unique challenges due to the dynamic and spontaneous nature of dialogues, where individuals express a wide range of emotions that evolve over time  [16, 35, 45, 57] . While early ERC approaches predominantly relied on textual data  [26] , this modality alone often fails to capture the subtlety and variability of emotional expression  [11] . As a result, Multimodal ERC (MERC), which incorporates audio and visual modalities alongside text, has gained growing interest for its potential to model richer emotional cues  [13, 46, 48] .\n\nTo integrate information from multiple modalities, MERC methods commonly adopt fusion strategies such as feature concatenation  [11, 43] , attention mechanisms  [41, 48]  and heterogeneous graph-based approaches  [3, 13, 17] . Recent state-of-the-art models, such as  [53] , have advanced this space by hierarchically integrating modality-specific features and optimizing for emotion classification. While these methods have led to strong performance on benchmark datasets, they remain fundamentally data-driven and lack structured, semantically aligned priors to guide the fusion process. This limits their robustness and generalization, especially when handling ambiguous, noisy, or weakly correlated multimodal inputs, which are common in real-world conversational settings.\n\nIn this paper, we introduce a novel approach that enhances the semantic alignment and robustness of multimodal fusion by integrating CLIP-guided visual anchors, which serve as emotion-specific prototypes encoded from real images. For each of the emotional classes, we select a small set of representative facial images and encode them using CLIP's image encoder. The mean embedding per class is used as a semantic anchor, which guides the alignment of all three modalities (visual, acoustic, textual) within a shared emotion-centric representation space. To enhance generalization and mitigate overfitting to fixed anchors, we introduce a stochastic sampling strategy that alternates between using class-wise center anchors and randomly selected instances during training. This approach balances semantic stability with intra-class variability, effectively serving as semantic augmentation. The sampled anchors are applied to both unimodal and fused representations, promoting discriminative, robust, and semantically coherent feature learning.\n\nImportantly, while most prior approaches that leverage CLIP focus on its textual modality to align features, typically mapping audio or visual inputs to text-derived embeddings (e.g., prompts such as \"this is a sad face\"), we deliberately reverse this trend. These prior methods use text prompts because CLIP's textual encoder offers a powerful, zero-shot compatible representation space and is easier to manipulate through language. However, textual descriptions of emotions are often ambiguous, abstract, and culturally variable, whereas emotional expressions in human faces are more concrete, universal, and visually grounded  [10, 14, 15, 20, 38, 47] . By anchoring fusion around CLIP's visual embeddings, we embrace a more perceptually grounded and psychologically aligned representation of emotion, closer to how humans perceive affective states.\n\nThis design draws on rich insights from cognitive psychology. The use of CLIP-based visual anchors reflects the prototypical emotion theory  [7, 8] , which posits that emotional categories are organized around prototypical exemplars, such as a canonical \"angry\" or \"happy\" face. The use of CLIP-derived anchors mimics this structure by introducing emotion prototypes derived from real-world facial imagery. Moreover, our approach is aligned with the theory of multisensory integration in emotion perception  [6] , which suggests that the human brain aligns information from multiple channels using known emotional schemas. By aligning each modality with shared visual anchors, our method mimics this natural mechanism of emotional cognition. Additionally, affective priming  [9]  and embodied cognition theories  [1]  provide psychological justification: humans often interpret ambiguous emotional signals by referencing mental imagery or contextually induced affective states. Our visual anchors serve a similar role in guiding the model's internal representation toward consistent emotional interpretations.\n\nBy bridging advances in vision-language pretraining with psychologically grounded theories of emotion, our approach offers a new paradigm for MERC that is both more robust and more humanaligned. In summary, our contributions are threefold: To the best of our knowledge, this is the first visually driven use of CLIP in MERC, opening a new and unexplored direction. • Psychologically Grounded Design: Our framework is inspired by cognitive and affective psychological theories, such as prototypical emotion categories and multisensory integration, providing semantically meaningful guidance for emotion modeling. • State-of-the-Art Performance: Our approach achieves stateof-the-art results on two widely used benchmarks, IEMOCAP and MELD, demonstrating its effectiveness in both fine-grained and diverse conversational emotion recognition settings.",

While traditional ERC has focused on textual input  [33, 35] , its limited emotional expressiveness has driven the development of MERC, which integrates text, audio, and visual modalities  [12, 21-23, 26, 49, 50, 54] . Early fusion approaches  [26]  simply concatenate features, but often struggle with modality imbalance and noise. More advanced strategies leverage attention  [49, 55] , memory  [50] , contextaware modeling  [12, 30] , and semantic refinement  [51, 54]  to better capture inter-modal and temporal dependencies. However, most existing models remain data-driven, lacking structured semantic priors or emotion-level prototypes to guide multimodal alignment. CLIP for Emotion and Multimodal Representation. CLIP  [37]  has demonstrated strong generalization in vision-language tasks via large-scale contrastive pretraining. In emotion recognition, recent works  [27, 36, 56 ] adapt CLIP's textual encoder with emotion prompts for zero-shot classification, yet focus on text-based alignment. These approaches underutilize CLIP's visual encoder and overlook the universality of visual affective cues. Notably, CLIP has not been explored in the context of MERC, leaving a gap in leveraging perceptual visual semantics for multimodal emotional grounding.",

The introduction of two parallel branches offers several advantages over a single-branch design: 1) Decoupled Objectives: Visual anchoring and supervised classification are optimized independently, mitigating gradient interference between semantic alignment and task-specific learning. 2) Modularity and Scalability: The VEGA branch can be fine-tuned or extended in isolation, without requiring retraining of the fusion branch, thus enabling flexible experimentation and deployment. 3) Complementary Supervision: While the fusion branch focuses on capturing signal quality and cross-modal interactions, the VEGA branch grounds the learning process in semantically rich visual priors, enhancing robustness under noisy or ambiguous input conditions.",

VEGA is applied at two levels of representation: (i) Unimodal Anchoring: VEGA guides the semantic projection of each modalityspecific representation, enhancing the emotional discriminability of unimodal features. (ii) Multimodal Anchoring: After fusion, the same anchoring mechanism is applied to refine the fused representation, aligning it with CLIP-derived emotion anchors in a shared semantic space.

These anchors are used to guide the alignment of modality-specific and fused representations within a shared emotion-centric representation space.\n\nStochastic Anchor Sampling Strategy. To improve the stability and generalization of visual emotion guided anchoring, we propose a simple yet effective stochastic anchor sampling strategy. During training, we alternate between two types of anchors for each emotion class: the Center Anchor (the mean embedding computed as in Eq.(  17 )) and the Random Anchor (a randomly selected instance embedding from the same class as defined in Eq.(  16 )). This stochasticity encourages the model to align features not only with stable semantic prototypes but also with diverse intra-class variations, thereby enhancing robustness and flexibility. This strategy offers two key benefits: (i) Stability -the center anchor serves as a canonical prototype, providing a stable and generalizable semantic reference for alignment, thereby promoting semantic consistency and reducing sensitivity; (ii) Variabilitythe use of randomly selected anchors introduces semantic perturbations, encouraging the model to learn robust associations between diverse intra-class visual representations and their emotion labels. This stochastic alternation between stable and augmentative anchors acts as a form of semantic augmentation, mitigating overfitting to specific anchor instances and enhancing semantic diversity for more flexible and generalizable feature learning.\n\nFormally, at each training iteration, for a given emotion class 𝑐, the selected anchor a 𝑐 ∈ R 𝑑 anc is defined as:\n\nTo express the strategy more compactly, we define:\n\nwhere 𝑟 ∼ Bernoulli(𝑞) is a binary variable determining the sampling mode. The hyperparameter 𝑞 ∈ (0, 1) controls the probability of selecting the center anchor (e.g., 𝑞 = 0.5 gives equal probability to both types). 𝑗 ∈ {1, . . . , 𝑛} denotes a randomly sampled index.\n\nVisual Emotion Guided Anchoring. We apply the VEGA mechanism at both the unimodal and multimodal levels to inject CLIPderived visual emotion anchor priors into the representation space. Unimodal Anchoring.

Eliminating intra-modal transformers moderately impairs performance, while removing inter-modal transformers further reduces accuracy, confirming the importance of both modality-specific and cross-modal modeling.

We conduct ablation studies by swapping their respective teacher: (1) Anchoringbased distillation with classification teacher. Replacing anchoring teacher with classification logits significantly reduces performance.\n\n(2) Classification-based distillation with anchoring-based teacher. Conversely, using the anchoring fusion distribution to supervise the classification branch leads to further degradation.\n\nVisual Sample Number in Anchor Construction We evaluate the impact of image diversity by varying the number of images used per class to construct anchors. Using only a single image per class yields the worst performance due to limited intra-class coverage, resulting in rigid and unrepresentative anchors. Increasing to 35 images brings a significant improvement by balancing diversity and consistency. However, using 100 or more images slightly degrades performance, likely due to over-diversification introducing noise and assignment instability. Excessively dispersed anchors reduce alignment precision and slow convergence under our similaritythresholded matching strategy.\n\nEffect of Anchor Sampling Threshold 𝑞 We examine how the anchor sampling threshold 𝑞 affects performance. Best results are achieved at 𝑞 = 0.2, which balances exploration of diverse anchors with convergence toward stable assignments. Setting 𝑞 = 0, which always selecting the center anchor, slightly reduces performance, likely due to limited intra-class variability modeling. Higher values (e.g., 𝑞 = 0.5) lead to further degradation, as excessive randomness in anchor assignment hampers semantic consistency.\n\nEffect of CLIP Visual Encoder Choice We assess the impact of different CLIP visual encoders on the quality of emotion anchors. Among the tested backbones, ViT-L/14@336 achieves the best performance, outperforming smaller or lower-resolution variants such as ViT-B/16. This improvement can be attributed to two factors: (1) larger model capacity (ViT-L) enables better capture of high-level emotional semantics, and (2) higher input resolution (336px) preserves subtle affective cues (e.g., facial micro-expressions) crucial for emotion grounding. In contrast, lower-capacity or lower-resolution models produce anchors with limited semantic granularity, weakening feature-to-anchor alignment.\n\nEffect of Modality and Modality Combinations We evaluate the contribution of individual modalities and pairwise combinations to overall performance. Among unimodal inputs, text achieves the highest performance, reflecting its strong correlation with emotion semantics. Audio performs moderately, while visual cues alone yield the lowest results. When combining modalities, all pairs show consistent improvement. The best result is obtained from text + audio, indicating complementary strengths, text provides semantic precision, while audio adds prosodic and tonal cues.",
