To address this, we propose a novel multi-granularity hierarchical fusion transformer (MGHFT), with a multi-view sticker interpreter based on Multimodal Large Language Models. Specifically, inspired by the human ability to interpret sticker emotions from multiple views, we first use Multimodal Large Language Models to interpret stickers by providing rich textual context via multiview descriptions. Then, we design a hierarchical fusion strategy to fuse the textual context into visual understanding, which builds upon a pyramid visual transformer to extract both global and local sticker features at multiple stages. Through contrastive learning and attention mechanisms, textual features are injected at different stages of the visual backbone, enhancing the fusion of global-and local-granularity visual semantics with textual guidance. Finally, we introduce a text-guided fusion attention mechanism to effectively integrate the overall multimodal features, enhancing semantic understanding.

      "text": "Stickers, as a popular and expressive form of online communication, serve as an important medium for users to convey emotions in online chatting  [51] . Compared to plain text, stickers encapsulate a rich combination of visual elements and accompanying textual cues, enabling more vivid and nuanced emotional expression  [12, 35] . With the increasing integration of stickers into social media and instant messaging platforms, Sticker Emotion Recognition (SER) has emerged as a promising research direction, drawing growing interest from the academic community. SER aims to automatically identify and classify the emotional content conveyed through stickers by leveraging both visual and textual modalities  [26] . This research enhances natural and empathetic human-computer interaction while advancing affective computing with novel insights and practical implications for emotion-aware AI systems.\n\nCompared to conventional image-based emotion recognition tasks  [43, 46] , SER introduces a set of unique and more complex Figure  1 : Comparison with pre-trained models on SER30K dataset. Multimodal Large Language Models such as LLaVA and GPT-4o can understand the content of stickers but cannot effectively recognize the emotion in them. Pre-trained visual models such as CLIP and BLIP can extract visual features for classification, but the performance is not good enough. Compared to these methods, our proposed MGHFT demonstrates an obvious improvement in both accuracy and F1 score.\n\nchallenges. One of the most prominent difficulties lies in the implicit nature of emotional cues commonly found on stickers, such as culture background and style, which are often context-dependent and subtle  [37, 52] . Additionally, the vast diversity in sticker styles, themes, and visual representations further complicates the task of accurately identifying emotional content  [5] . Unlike standard facial expression recognition or sentiment analysis from images, interpreting emotions in stickers often requires a holistic understanding that combines multiple views, including the intent behind the sticker  [17, 18] , its stylistic tone, character actions, and even cultural or conversational context. Even for humans, accurate emotion understanding of stickers frequently relies on background knowledge and contextual inference, underscoring the complexity of SER and the need for advanced multimodal modeling approaches.\n\nRecent studies show that vision-language pre-trained models can effectively extract meaningful visual representations and have been widely applied to image understanding tasks  [10, 22, 30, 53] . On the one hand, multimodal foundation models such as LLaVA  [25]  and GPT-4o  [15]  excel in image-based generation tasks, leveraging their powerful visual-textual reasoning abilities and extensive background knowledge. On the other hand, vision-language models (VLMs) like CLIP  [30]  and BLIP  [22] , which are pre-trained through image-text alignment, have shown competitive performance in image classification tasks. Robust visual understanding provides a crucial foundation for the SER task, but it alone is not sufficient. More rich information about stickers from multi-views like style and details is also important. The results of the experiment presented in Figure  1  also prove this point. As illustrated in Figure  1 , experimental results on the SER30K dataset reveal a significant performance gap between these state-of-the-art VLMs and our proposed method. This discrepancy highlights an important insight. Accurately perceiving and interpreting subtle, implicit emotional cues like intention remains a significant challenge. Therefore, achieving effective emotion recognition in stickers requires a more comprehensive integration of contextual knowledge, emotional reasoning, and multi-view understanding.\n\nIn this context, inspired by the way humans understand the emotion of stickers from multiple views, we propose a Multi-Granularity Hierarchical Fusion Transformer (MGHFT) to effectively integrate contextual text information into visual feature extraction. First, we introduce a multi-view sticker interpreter that leverages the powerful visual understanding capabilities of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) to generate rich textual descriptions from four views: intent, overall style, main character, and character details. These descriptions serve as rich semantic cues, aligning the model's emotional reasoning with human perception. Second, we develop a hierarchical fusion strategy that incorporates multi-view textual features into different stages of visual representation learning. Specifically, we adopt a Pyramid Vision Transformer (PVT) as the visual backbone and inject view-specific textual features at each layer. In every stage, a 𝐶𝐿𝑆 token captures global semantics, while local features are selectively attended based on attention weights. Through attention-based fusion and contrastive learning, the model performs fine-grained visual-textual alignment at both the global and local granularity. Finally, we introduce a Text-Guided Fusion Attention (TGFA) mechanism that aggregates and aligns multiview textual semantics with visual representations across all stages, yielding robust emotion-aware features for SER. Extensive experiments on two large-scale sticker emotion datasets, SER30K and MET-MEME, show that our proposed MGHFT model consistently performs best, validating the effectiveness of MGHFT.\n\nOur main contributions can be summarized as follows:\n\n• We design a multi-view sticker interpreter that utilizes MLLMs to decompose stickers into multiple views, providing multiview descriptions, thereby aligning human perceptual modalities to enrich the understanding of stickers. By introducing the knowledge of MLLMs, our model further improves the performance of emotion recognition.",

Furthermore, recognizing that stickers with similar themes often exhibit similar emotional characteristics, recent research begins to explore the role of thematic information in sticker emotion recognition. Liu et al.  [26]  extracts global and local thematic information and applies attention mechanisms for end-to-end sticker emotion recognition. Chen et al.

      "text": "In recent years, multimodal sticker understanding has attracted widespread attention  [2, 16, 20, 24, 47] . Unlike general multimodal understanding tasks, sticker comprehension relies more heavily on contextual and external information  [52] .\n\nMany multimodal fusion methods rely heavily on linguistic features extracted from OCR-recognized text. For example, references  [9, 54]  employ LSTM networks to encode textual information obtained from OCR. Wang et al.  [37] introduced both cross-modal and intra-modal attention mechanisms, along with a multimodal matching loss, to better capture the interactions between text and image for enhanced multimodal sticker understanding. Zheng et al.  [52]  focused on finer-grained features and proposed an object-level multimodal interaction framework. Considering that stickers frequently appear in dialogue scenarios, some works have integrated sticker understanding into conversational contexts. For instance, certain studies incorporate causal knowledge from text to help models recognize the emotional states expressed in stickers, thereby improving understanding performance  [4] . Other approaches leverage large-scale knowledge learning and distillation to enrich the model's feature representations to further enhance sticker comprehension  [40] . Additionally, some research emphasizes dialogue intent recognition, using intent-driven alignment mechanisms to achieve deeper understanding of stickers within conversations  [23] . Distinct from these methods, this study focuses on leveraging multiview emotional cues to guide multimodal fusion, aiming to enhance the model's ability to comprehend stickers more effectively.",

Our proposed MGHFT method can be divided into three main parts. First, we adopt MLLM to obtain multi-view description information of stickers to align with how humans understand stickers. Then, we use PVT to extract the multi-granularity features of the stickers in stages, and we design a novel multi-granularity crossmodal fusion mechanism to integrate the descriptive information from different views into different stages for better representation.

      "text": "When encountering a new sticker, humans typically interpret it from multiple views. On the one hand, humans will consider the intended usage scenario  [29, 32]  and the overall visual style  [1, 32, 49]  to form an initial understanding of its meaning. On the other hand, humans pay attention to the specific characters and their detailed features to assess whether the sticker suits their communicative needs  [19, 23, 28, 31] . Inspired by this human sticker comprehension process, we divide sticker understanding into four views. To help the model better understand the contextual information of stickers, we designed an MLLM-based Multi-View Sticker Interpreter. This module extracts multi-perspective information from stickers and incrementally injects it into the model through a multi-stage fusion process. Specifically, we define four essential views to comprehensively capture sticker semantics: intention 𝐷 𝐼 , overall style 𝐷 𝑆 , main roles 𝐷 𝑀𝑅 , and fine-grained character details 𝐷 𝑃𝐸 . These views enable a more holistic and detailed interpretation of sticker content. In recent years, MLLMs have demonstrated remarkable performance in the field of image understanding. These models can effectively activate their deep feature extraction capabilities through carefully designed prompts, enabling precise semantic comprehension of visual content. To enhance the semantic representation of sticker images, we employ the MLLM LLaVA-NeXT 1  [25] , leveraging its powerful cross-modal understanding ability to generate multi-view attribute descriptions of stickers.\n\nAs illustrated in Figure  3 , we adopt a multi-round interaction strategy with an MLLM, leveraging carefully crafted prompts to direct its attention to specific aspects of each sticker view. This process facilitates the generation of fine-grained and informative descriptions across multiple views. Subsequently, we adopt a BERTbased text encoder as the textual backbone to convert these attribute descriptions into dense textual representations for downstream processing as Eq. 2.\n\n1 https://huggingface.co/llava-hf/llava-v1.6-mistral-7b-hf",

Specifically, we design a novel hierarchical fusion mechanism that injects multiview knowledge into different stages of visual representation learning. Considering that textual descriptions may capture both global and local aspects of a sticker, we introduce a multi-granularity fusion strategy to ensure effective alignment and integration between textual features and visual representations. On the one hand, local features 𝑉 𝑙 correspond to key visual tokens, and directly aligning them with textual features may lead to the loss of important visual semantics. To address this, we adopt a fusion strategy at the local granularity level, integrating textual and local visual features to obtain richer representations. On the other hand, as global features encapsulate the overall semantics of a sticker, aligning and integrating them with multi-view textual features helps the model better understand emotional information and learn more expressive global representations. To bridge the semantic gap between global visual features 𝑉 𝑔 and textual features 𝑇 , we introduce an alignment loss. Furthermore, after completing all stages of feature extraction, we perform a final fusion between the overall global features and textual features to mitigate the potential performance impact caused by the sequential order of multi-view integration.",

Specifically, we first use linear layers to project the textual feature 𝑇 𝑖 into 𝑇 ′ 𝑖 , which has the same dimension of local-granularity vision features 𝑉 𝑖 𝑙 . Then, we compute the attention scores between 𝑉 𝑖 𝑙 and 𝑉 ′𝑖 𝑡 and apply softmax normalization to the scores. Then, it performs a weighted summation to enhance the representation of local features. The whole process can be illustrated in Eq. 3.\n\nIn this way, the proposed Soft-Fusion mechanism effectively leverages additional information from 𝑇 𝑖 and utilizes the attention mechanism to enable 𝑉 𝑖 𝑙 to focus on the most relevant parts of 𝑇 𝑖 , significantly enriching the feature representation of 𝑉 𝑖 𝑙 . Moreover, we introduce a residual connection to prevent gradient vanishing, ensuring that the original feature information is preserved and facilitating more robust learning. We adopt this mechanism in each stage to hierarchically fuse the different views of textual features into the local-granularity visual features. Then, we use MLPs to project the 𝑉 ′𝑖 𝑙 and 𝑇 ′ 𝑖 into the output dimension for further fusion. 3.3.2 Global-Granularity. For global features 𝑉 𝑖 𝑔 , we employ an alignment loss to leverage textual representations as guidance for global visual feature extraction, encouraging the model to learn cross-modal features effectively. This loss consists of two components: Contrastive Loss L 𝑐𝑙 and Multi-Level Cross-Entropy Loss (MLCE Loss) L 𝑚𝑙𝑐𝑒  [45] . Together, they facilitate the alignment of visual and textual features, thereby enhancing the cross-modal representations effectively. We normalize the global visual and textual features to obtain the contrastive loss as Eq. 4.\n\nwhere 𝑆 𝑣𝑡 is the similarity between global visual and textual features, 𝜏 is a temperature parameter, L 𝑐𝑒 denotes the Cross-Entropy Loss, and y represents the matching indices. Furthermore, we introduce the MLCE Loss to improve the visualtext alignment robustness, which utilizes cosine similarity and Kullback-Leibler Divergence 𝐷 KL to distill information between features as Eq. 5.\n\nwhere 𝐶 𝑙 and 𝐶 ℎ are the normalized self-similarity matrices of The final cross-modal alignment loss is given by Eq. 6.\n\nwhere 𝜆 is set as 30 to control the contribution of MLCE loss to the total alignment loss  [45] .\n\nWe then separately stack the global features ℎ 𝑔 and textual features ℎ 𝑡 and apply the Soft-Fusion Mechanism to enhance the globalgranularity features, resulting in ℎ ′ 𝑔 , as shown in Eq. 7.\n\nUltimately, for both textual and visual features, we obtain corresponding local-granularity and global-granularity representations, which are then separately stacked for the final cross-modal fusion.",

For (1), we adopt baselines include: VGG  [53]  and ResNet  [10] , ViT  [8] , WSC-NET  [44] , PDANet  [50] , LORA  [26] , MAM  [48] , and TGCA-PVT  [5] . We followed the baseline result of Ref.

Table  1  shows the emotion recognition results of (1) on the SER30K dataset with SER models. According to the comparison results shown in the table, our proposed MGHFT demonstrates a significant performance advantage on the SER30k dataset, achieving the highest accuracy of 73.31% and an F1 score of 72.52%. Compared to the best-performing baseline method, TGCA-PVT, which achieves 71.63% accuracy and 70.93% F1 score, MGHFT improves the accuracy by 2.3% and the F1 score by 2.2%. Compared to the image emotion recognition method MAM, our proposed MGHFT shows a much more significant improvement. These consistent improvements across both metrics highlight the effectiveness of our method in more comprehensively capturing the emotion-related features of stickers.\n\nIn particular, the results of (2) are shown in Figure  1 . The much lower performance results than other methods suggest that LLaVA and GPT-4o are still struggling with the task of directly understanding sticker emotions. In addition, CLIP and BLIP2, with their strong image feature extraction capability, achieved a relatively good performance after training on the classification head, but there is still a gap in comparison to the models specifically used for sticker emotion understanding. Compared with these pre-trained visual models, our proposed MGHFT model demonstrates significant advantages in emotion recognition results, achieving an improvement of 5.4% in F1 score and 4.0% in accuracy over the BLIP2, which is the best-performing pre-trained model. To further evaluate the robustness of our proposed MGHFT, we conduct experiments on the MET-MEME dataset, as shown in Table  2 . We adopt the baselines and experimental results from Ref.  [52] . Compared to the SER30k dataset, emotion recognition on MET-MEME is more challenging due to the significantly smaller number of training samples and greater visual-textual variation. Despite the increased difficulty, MGHFT still achieves the best performance across all evaluation metrics, with an accuracy of 35.13%, a precision of 34.75%, and a recall of 35.12%. Compared with the strongest baseline method, MGMCF, which achieves a precision of 34.36%, a precision of 37. 77% and a recall of 34.88%, our method achieves a 0.77 percentage point gain in accuracy while maintaining a comparable performance in recall and more balanced precision.

CL means the contrastive learning between 𝑉 𝑔 and 𝑇 𝑖 used in our method, TGFA denotes our proposed Text-Guided Fusion Attention module, while GF and LF represent the soft fusion mechanisms for global-granularity and local-granularity feature fusion, respectively. Results are shown in Table  3 . As shown in Table  3 , none of the ablated variants outperform the full model, which underscores the complementary roles and necessity of each component in achieving optimal performance. For the model with a single module, we can observe that the model with only the TGFA module exhibited the most significant performance drop compared to the full model. Compared to the backbone without any module, the model with CL has the highest F1 score (from 69.89% to 70.98%). This result is also consistent with the results of removing each module from the full model: the model without CL has the most significant performance degradation compared to the full model than with the other modules removed.\n\nFurthermore, we evaluate combinations of two components to explore their joint effect. We also adopt the commonly used crossattention module to replace our proposed Soft-Fusion mechanism (CA). CG refers to using CL and GF, GL refers to using GF and LF, and CT refers to using CL and TGFA. The performance of each variant is shown in Figure  5 .\n\nThe results indicate that combining any two of the proposed modules consistently enhances sticker emotion classification performance. Notably, the combinations of CL with GF and CL with TGFA yielded the most significant improvements. Specifically, CL helps align multi-view textual features with global visual representations, effectively narrowing the semantic gap between modalities and enhancing the performance of both GF and TGFA modules. Interestingly, the combination of GF and LF, without contrastive learning, resulted in a more substantial improvement in the F1 score than accuracy. This suggests that multi-granularity feature fusion improves the model's ability to recognize diverse emotions, leading to more balanced classification outcomes. The results of CA also show that our proposed Soft-Fusion not only achieves better fusion performance but also avoids introducing extra parameters, thereby improving computational efficiency.",

Furthermore, we concatenate the descriptions from all views to form a unified multi-view representation 𝑇 , integrating it at each stage of the process. The experimental results, as presented in Table  4 , demonstrate the effectiveness and importance of incorporating multi-view textual information.

Interestingly, this order also aligns with the way humans typically interpret emotional content in stickers-first considering whether the intention  is sarcastic, then perceiving the overall style, followed by attention to characters and posture details. Moreover, we find that injecting only the character details (𝑇 4 ) at each stage results in the lowest classification performance. This highlights the importance of our proposed multi-view description, which provides richer and more diverse contextual information, thereby enabling the model to better comprehend the emotional content embedded in the stickers.

Furthermore, we design a text-guided multimodal attention fusion mechanism that effectively integrates visual and textual features, significantly enhancing the representational power and emotion classification accuracy of sticker data. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that each component of the proposed framework contributes meaningfully to the overall performance. We hope this work can serve as a valuable reference and inspiration for future research in sticker emotion analysis.",
