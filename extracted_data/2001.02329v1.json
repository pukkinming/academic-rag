      "text": "There have been lot of efforts in defining emotions in a multi-dimensional space. Such models of emotions aim at modelling human emotions by defining where they lie in two or three dimensions. The key idea behind having multiple dimensions is to incorporate the neurophysiological system which causes different affective states in humans.\n\nTo fulfill our final goal of identifying stress from audio signals, we take the help of Lovheim's cube  [4] . This cube gives the direct relation between specific combinations of the levels of the signal substances which are produced in our bodies and eight basic emotions. These signal substances are called as Neurotransmitters which are nothing but the messengers transmitting signals across a chemical synapse in our bodies. The figure  1  shows a Lovheim's cube of emotion where three Neurotransmitters, dopamine, noradrenaline and serotonin form the axes of a coordinate system. The eight basic emotions including seven emotions on which our CNN is trained and the emotion -stress (distress), are placed in the eight corners.\n\nWe first take the 64 dimensional representation from the second last layer of Emo-CNN and feed it to 3 PCA. This 3 dimensional representation of audio signal is then mapped onto the Lovheim's cube. The table II shows the mapped values of test audio signals by CNN + 3 PCA. The emotion Happy (Joy) according to the Lovheim's model is produced by the combination of low noradrenaline, high dopamine and high serotonin. Our CNN + 3 PCA model's learnt representation gives the levels of these 3 Neurotransmitters as -2.00, 0.16 and 0.69 resp. From table II we can see that this computational method complies with the theory of Lovheim's cube from psychology. Since our proposed method can model the Lovheim's cube we can now use the 3 dimensional features of audio signals and check their proximity to the stress (Distress) point of the cube. Since Lovheim's cube gives us the relative position of stress from other emotions in 3D space, the proposed approach can easily identify the stressed audio speech without using the labelled stress data. Refer to figure  2 .",

      "text": "This work shows the potential of Deep Learning models in understanding the chemistry of human emotions. It is very interesting to note that although Emo-CNN was just trained on audio signals and emotion labels, it was also able to model the brain chemistry of these emotions. There is significant amount of research still to be conducted to determine the validity and reliability of this model, particularly in having the generalizable and meaningful mapping of features onto Lovheim's cube. Specifically, next steps would be to have a more precise method to find the proximity of test audio signals to the stress (Distress) point of the cube.",
