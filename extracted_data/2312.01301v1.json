      "text": "In today's competitive landscape, businesses grapple with customer retention. Churn prediction models, although beneficial, often lack accuracy due to the reliance on a single data source. The intricate nature of human behavior and highdimensional customer data further complicate these efforts. To address these concerns, this paper proposes a multimodal fusion learning model for identifying customer churn risk levels in financial service providers. Our multimodal approach integrates customer sentiments, financial literacy (FL) level, and financial behavioral data, enabling more accurate and bias-free churn prediction models. The proposed FL model utilizes a SMOGN-COREG supervised model to gauge customer FL levels from their financial data. The baseline churn model applies an ensemble artificial neural network and oversampling techniques to predict churn propensity in high-dimensional financial data. We also incorporate a speech emotion recognition model employing a pretrained CNN-VGG16 to recognize customer emotions based on pitch, energy, and tone. To integrate these diverse features while retaining unique insights, we introduced late and hybrid fusion techniques that complementary boost coordinated multimodal colearning. Robust metrics were utilized to evaluate the proposed multimodal fusion model and hence the approach's validity, including mean average precision and macro-averaged F1 score. Our novel approach demonstrates a marked improvement in churn prediction, achieving a test accuracy of 91.2%, a Mean Average Precision (MAP) score of 66, and a Macro-Averaged F1 score of 54 through the proposed hybrid fusion learning technique compared with late fusion and baseline models. Furthermore, the analysis demonstrates a positive correlation between negative emotions, low FL scores, and high-risk customers.",

      "text": "Understanding and predicting customer churn has become paramount for long-term success in an increasingly competitive business landscape  [1] . Customer churn, or customer attrition, directly affects a company's revenue and growth potential, making it essential to be accurately predicted and prevented  [2] . Furthermore, the human cognitive system is inherently susceptible to cognitive biases, such as anchoring bias, the availability heuristic, and the bandwagon effect  [9] . These biases can significantly skew customer's feeling and decision-making towards products and services. Misguided customer interactions or suboptimal presentations of complex financial products can trigger these biases, prompting a focus on potential risks over service benefits. For financial service providers, understanding these psychological factors is crucial. It allows them to tailor product design, marketing strategies, and customer relationship management (CRM) to mitigate negative biases and churn rate. Therefore, predicting customer emotion and knowledge about products and services is not just advantageous-it's pivotal for businesses striving for success in today's highly competitive marketplace.\n\nCustomer historical data recorded by organizations is increasing exponentially, and data analytics specialists contend that the traditional customer churn analysis method, which heavily relied on transactional data and customer demographics, is no longer a robust solution. A more comprehensive approach is required to better deal with the heterogeneous data input in various modalities.\n\nThe current study aims to predict customer churn propensity by incorporating diverse modalities for the first time, to our best knowledge. The proposed approach incorporates survey analysis regarding customer financial literacy level, emotion detection from customer voices (CV), and CRM data to offer a more comprehensive representation of churn risk.\n\nThe proposed approach utilizes multimodal machine learning (ML) methods for a more holistic understanding of customer churn. This approach is characterized by considering multiple facets of the customer experience, from interactions with customer service to engagement with a product or service.\n\nMultimodality in ML refers to the integration of two or more distinct inputs, recorded in different media formats, within a single ML model. The unique aspect of these inputs is that they cannot be unambiguously mapped into one another using an algorithm  [11] . We proposed a fusion learning to force similarities of these inputs into a coordinated feature representation space. Subsequently, a decision-level fusion is applied to rank churn risk.",

      "text": "Customer sentiment analysis can be divided into para linguistic, using CV analysis, or linguistic or text based approaches. Recorded customer service calls can be analyzed to understand customer satisfaction. Although sentiment analysis using natural language processing (NLP) can be used to transcribe and analyze these calls; meaning is often also conveyed by tone, pitch, and loudness. Thus, humans provide and receive considerable meta-information during a conversation apart from the text. This is an inherent problem for text-based sentiment analysis in NLP, whereas non-linguistic emotion detection through speech signal processing is somewhat more robust  [3] . Customers negative emotions are often good indicators of product dissatisfaction, and these customers can be considered to have higher churn risk due to their discernible discontent, warranting special attention. To decode emotion from CV, we introduced a voice-based sentiment analysis model  [3] . The central innovation of our work lies in the development of a novel hybrid feature map generator algorithm using harmonic and percussive components of Mel Spectrogram that improves speech emotion recognition (SER).",

Financially literate customers are generally better equipped to comprehend the range of products and services available, enabling them to better select the most suitable option(s) to meet their requirements. This reduces dissatisfaction and subsequent churn probability. In contrast, customers with low financial literacy could struggle to understand the options, and hence make sub-optimal decisions regarding financial products and services, leading to dissatisfaction and potential migration to competing financial institutions perceived to offer superior products. We introduced a SMOGN-COREG model to deal with unlabelled examples via semi-supervised regression (SSR) methods  [8] .

Given the identified challenges and opportunities, this study introduces several significant contributions as below:\n\n-In a first-of-its-kind approach, we proposed a multimodal hybrid fusion model that integrates distinct databases, including CRM, CV, and FL data. This enables us to add an essential layer of understanding customer behavior for churn prediction by discerning customer emotion from their vocal attributes and measuring financial literacy level from their account performance and survey data. -We built a specific coordinated feature representation space and translation matrix that reflects data similarity meaningfully to capture interactions between modalities, with the capability of adding future modalities like textual features in the proposed framework. -Identifying significant correlations between negative emotions, low FL, and increased churn risk.

Hence, multimodal churn modelling will continue to advance, providing ever more refined strategies for churn prediction by encompassing various customer experience facets for holistic customer churn understanding  [14] .\n\nDe Caigny explored the benefits from incorporating textual data into customer churn prediction (CCP) models and highlighted superior performance from convolutional neural networks (CNNs) compared with other text mining methods for CCP, achieving 89.87% accuracy. Outcomes from their study will help guide researchers regarding text mining for improved CCP  [4] .\n\nNhi NY and Liu proposed predicting client churn by analyzing unstructured data, e.g. audio calls, in machine learning models. Their approach expanded traditional methods, which tend to focus on structured data, such as demographics and transactions. In contrast, their proposed model combined text mining with a gradient boosting tree algorithm to improve the client churn model predictive performance. This approach achieved significant predictive accuracy improvement, increasing at least 5% across various customer datasets  [5] .\n\nKimura highlighted benefits from combining boosting algorithms with hybrid resampling methods for CP, which could significantly enhance prediction effectiveness and practicality in both academic and industry settings. The challenge from imbalanced datasets was explicitly discussed, and showed that although hybrid resampling methods, including synthetic minority over-sampling technique (SMOTE), SMOTE-ENN, and SMOTE Tomek-Links, offer significant potential, they are yet to be widely adopted for CCP  [6] . Ahn and Hwang reviewed churn prediction methodologies, highlighting their chronological progression and underscored the necessity for adaptable and flexible approaches contingent on specific data formats. They also showed that very few previous studies adopted a multimodal approach to address churn prediction  [7] .\n\nAs delineated some recent work in Table I from our comprehensive literature review, many studies primarily focus on using singular structured data sources, such as CRM databases, for churn prediction tasks. Conversely, there needs to be more research that employs multiple data sources for the same purpose. To the best of our knowledge, our current investigation is the first that incorporates three discrete input data sets for the churn prediction problem. Therefore, the present study undertook a gap analysis and subsequently proposed an suitable methodology for CCP. This provides significant contributions by incorporating churn predictors, such as customer positive and negative emotional feedback from audio calls, and customer financial literacy level from survey data. The proposed synergistic hybrid feature fusion techniques and subsequent studies building on that framework, will mitigate bias for CCP. III.

Therefore, the proposed multi-modal model fusion these heterogeneous features while maintaining their unique insights towards churn modeling. We propose a specific coordinated representation space that reflects data similarity meaningfully to capture interactions between modalities with the ultimate goal to understand complementary customer behavior across various touchpoints, such as call center interaction, FL survey, and historic demographic data. The proposed coordinated representation space can be expressed as\n\nwhere x i is the modalities and functions f , v, and c representing independent unimodal learning networks, including FL, SER, and baseline churn model into the coordinated representation space; and ∼ is similarity or coordination in the projection into this space. We employ a translation dictionary to map features extracted from each modality while preserving similarity and meaningful patterns. The mapping matrix is represented through several logical propositions defined by experts, each corresponding to different condition(s) on the unimodal features. Each unimodal output data structure is mapped into two level numeric nominal variables based on a predetermined prediction confidence P (pred) threshold, defining a coordinated representation space by logical proposition(s). Constant weights are assigned to each matrix array C i , F i and V i depending on the unimodal feature weight in multimodal learning, which can be expressed as,\n\nwhere P 1(x i ), P 2(x i ), and P 3(x i ) denote propositions for each unimodal feature, respectively. Estimating suitable weights for each feature indicator is challenging.

This incorporates model and decision-level fusion, creating a multi-level fusion framework. We enforced constant fusion weight C i + F i + V i ≥ 0 and F i = V i by assuming fusion weights for FL and SER models had equal influential contribution to enhance baseline model performance. Therefore, a decision fusion D i was defined to integrate complementary information and hence rank the churn risk as low, mid, or high. The proposed decision fusion matrix D i can be expressed as\n\nsubject to fusion conditions\n\n• Low risk Churner:\n\nIf I lowrisk = 1, customer is classified as low risk. • Mid risk churner:\n\nIf I midrisk = 1, customer is classified as mid risk. • High risk churner:\n\nIf I highrisk = 1, customer is classified as high risk.\n\nWhere D i ∈ {0, 4} is a fusion output weight that embodies ranked risk for each member i. C i , represents the fundamental customer churn understanding based on historical patterns; F i is quantitative financial behavior understanding, i.e., customer FL; V i is a qualitative measure, reflecting customer emotional state and satisfaction level derived from their phone communication with call center; I(•) is an indicator function where I(•) = 1 if the condition in the brackets is true and 0 otherwise. Thus, the logical operators are designed such that exactly one of I lowrisk , I midrisk , and I highrisk should = 1 for a given customer risk level query. This ensures each customer is classified into exactly one risk category.\n\nThe synergistic integration occurs when these modalities fuse distinct learnings to generate a multimodal co-learning allows a coordinated representation of two modalities FL and SER influence complementary the training of another. Thus, this co-learning strategy mitigates the limitations of relying on a single source of information, thereby enhancing the model's robustness. We employed real-world data from multiple sources to evaluate the proposed approach efficiency, including customer historic data from finance networks, demographic data from CRM platforms, and voice data, as shown in Table  II .\n\nCustomer voices were replaced with similar voice from standard emotion databases to maintain privacy while preserving emotional content in the recorded voice files from inbound calls. The proposed method built a CV database leveraging the correlation between negative emotions and high risk churn customers with low financial literacy, as well as the association between positive emotions and low risk churn customers. The EMODB database, a standardized resource for categorizing emotions based on voice recordings, was utilized to label customer emotions  [14] . The FL database was built by combining financial network data and an online customer survey to measure FL level. After initial data processing, training data was enhanced to (4154, 140).
