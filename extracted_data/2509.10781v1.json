      "text": "Audio deepfake is so sophisticated that the lack of effective detection on methods is fatal. While most detection systems primarily rely on low-level acoustic features or pretrained speech representations, they frequently neglect high-level emotional cues, which can offer complementary and potentially anti-deepfake information to enhance generalization. In this work, we propose a novel audio anti-deepfake system that utilize emotional features(EmoAnti) by exploiting a pretrained Wav2Vec2 (W2V2) model fine-tuned on emotion recognition tasks,which derive emotion-guided representations, then designing a dedicated feature extractor based on convolutional layers with residual connections to effectively capture and refine emotional characteristics from the transformer layers outputs. Experimental results show that our proposed architecture achieves state-of-the-art performance on both the ASVspoof2019LA and ASVspoof2021LA benchmarks, and demonstrating strong generalization on the ASVspoof2021DF dataset.

      "text": "Text-to-speech (TTS) and voice conversion (VC) technologies, empowered by the rapid advancement of deep learning, have achieved remarkable realism in synthesized speech generation  [1] . While this progress has expanded their application domains, it also raises significant security concerns: such synthetic speech can be exploited to launch spoofing attacks against automatic speaker verification (ASV) systems, potentially leading to financial loss and privacy breaches. This has driven increasing research interest in audio anti-deepfake as a critical countermeasure.\n\nEarly audio anti-deepfake methods primarily relied on low-level acoustic features such as fundamental frequency (f0)  [2]  and LFCC  [3] . For example, Xue et al.  [2]  combined f0 with real and imaginary spectrograms for anti-deepfake. While interpretable, these approaches often neglect high-level emotional information and exhibit limited generalization. Leveraging emotional features, Conti et al.  [4]  proposed a neural network to detect audio deepfake, whose current generation techniques are unable to accurately synthesize natural emotional behaviors in speech. To extract key features from deepfake audio, many approaches  [5, 6, 7]  use self-supervised speech models, which learn general-purpose representations from large-scale unlabeled speech, as their backbone. Although these approaches achieve promising performance, they lack the ability to interpret the general-purpose features learned by the pretrained models.\n\nTo address both the interpretability of learned representations and the generalization capability of the model, we propose a novel audio anti-deepfake framework: EmoAnti. Our approach is built upon two key components: 1) to capture high-level emotional information while enhancing the interpretability of speech embeddings, we adopt Wav2Vec2 as the backbone model and fine-tune it on a speech emotion recognition (SER) task; 2) to improve generalization, we design a convolutional residual feature extractor(CRFE) to refine emotion-guided representations from the transformer layers of Wav2Vec2 and identify subtle emotional discrepancies between bonafide and spoof speech.\n\nOur contributions are as follows:\n\n1) Based on emotional-aware embeddings, we propose a anti-deepfake method, which achieves strong generalization performance and maintains interpretability.\n\n2) To better capture and refine emotion-guided representations in speech, we design a convolutional residual feature extractor built upon Wav2Vec2.\n\n3) To validate the importance of emotional information in audio anti-deepfake, we conduct comprehensive ablation studies, which provide new insights for future research.\n\nFig.  1 : Overview of the EmoAnti framework.Dashed -line parts denote the internal detailed structures and the workflow during model operation.",

      "text": "The overall architecture of the proposed model is illustrated in Fig.  1 . Given raw audio waveforms as input, the fine-tuned Wav2Vec2 model processes them through a series of Conv1d and transformer layers to extract high-level emotion-guided representations. These features are then passed to the convolutional residual feature extractor and feature fusion moudle, which further refines and fuses multi-level emotional cues to generate enhanced fusion feature vectors. Finally, the fused representations are fed into a classifier to generate the final prediction. This section provides a detailed description of each component in the framework.",

      "text": "In this study, we adopt the wav2vec2-large-robust model  [8, 9]  as the frontend encoder. It consists of three main components: 1) a 7-layer convolutional feature extractor that transforms raw waveforms into a feature sequence X = {x 1 , x 2 , • • • , x N } using strided convolutions-initially with a stride of 5, followed by strides of 2-thereby reducing the temporal resolution; 2) a 12-layer transformer encoder (with 16 attention heads per layer) that captures long-range temporal dependencies; 3) a quantization module for latent speech representation learning. Let\n\ndenote the output of the l -th transformer layer (l ∈  [1, 12] ), and let\n\nl=1 represent the collection of outputs from all 12 transformer layers.\n\nTo adapt the pretrained model for emotion recognition and audio anti-deepfake, we fine-tune it by retaining the backbone of wav2vec2-large-robust-including the convolutional feature extractor and transformer encoder-to leverage its latent speech representations, while adding task-specific classification heads. For emotion recognition (Fig.  2 ), the classification head takes the final transformer layer's output H L as input and predicts emotion categories by leveraging paralinguistic cues. This enables the model to effectively transfer the emotion-guided representations learned during pretraining to the task of audio anti-deepfake.",

Inspired by this, we design a convolutional residual feature extractor to aggregate and refine emotional representations from multiple trans-former layers, thereby enhancing the ability to distinguish subtle emotional details in audio deepfakes. Specifically, the module consists of four sequential convolutional residual blocks. Each block's main branch contains two Conv1d layers (kernel size = 3, padding = 1): the first projects the input dimension d in to a hidden dimension d hidden through BatchNorm1d and ReLU activation, while the second preserves d hidden with an additional BatchNorm1d layer.\n\nwhere H l is the input hidden representation from the l-th transformer layer.\n\nThe residual branch uses a 1 × 1 Conv1d if d in ̸ = d hidden , otherwise it applies identity mapping:\n\nThe block output is then obtained by element-wise addition and ReLU activation:\n\nfollowed by transposing f to [B, T, d hidden ] for storage and further use.",

The main contribution of EmoAnti is constructing a Wav2Vec2 fine-tuned on emotion recognition tasks to extract emotional cues from speech, with subsequent refinement via a convolutional residual feature extractor to distinguish emotional differences between spoofed and bonafide speech. Comparative experiments demonstrate that our approach leveraging emotional details achieves excellent performance in audio anti-deepfake. Meanwhile, ablation studies further validate the significance of emotional information for anti-deepfake. There is still room for improvement: we can replace the CRFE with a model that attends to global information to enhance generalization on the 2021DF dataset.",
