      "text": "In this paper, we evaluate the different features sets, feature types, and classifiers on both song and speech emotion recognition. Three feature sets: GeMAPS, pyAudioAnalysis, and LibROSA; two feature types: low-level descriptors and high-level statistical functions; and four classifiers: multilayer perceptron, LSTM, GRU, and convolution neural networks are examined on both song and speech data with the same parameter values. The results show no remarkable difference between song and speech data using the same method. In addition, high-level statistical functions of acoustic features gained higher performance scores than low-level descriptors in this classification task. This result strengthen the previous finding on the regression task which reported the advantage use of high-level features.",

      "text": "Music emotion recognition is an attempt to recognize emotion, either categories or dimensions, within pieces of music. Music expresses and induces emotion. Therefore, the universality of emotion within the music can be extracted regardless the origin of music  [5] . Recognizing emotion in music is important, for instance, in the music application's recommender system.\n\nA Song is part of music that is performed by the human voice. While research on music emotion recognition is well-established, research on song emotion recognition is less developed. Since it is a part of music, recognizing song emotion recognition is essential for music emotion recognition. This research aimed to evaluate song emotion recognition in parallel with speech emotion recognition.\n\nIn speech emotion recognition, several acoustic features, types, and classifier have been developed. Moore at al. proved that using high-level features improves the performance of emotion recognition compared to using low-level features  [10] . Moreover, Atmaja and Akagi  [2]  showed that using high-level statistical functions (HSF), i.e., Mean+Std, of low-level descriptors (LLDs) of pyAudioAnalysis feature set  [2]  gains higher performance than using LLD itself. The reported results are obtained in dimensional emotion recognition tasks. In categorical emotion recognition, no report showed the effectiveness of Mean+Std from categorical emotion recognition. In addition to the evaluation of different types of features (LLDs vs HSFs) in categorical speech emotion recognition, we added the task to evaluate that feature types evaluation for song emotion recognition, as well as effect of different feature types and classifiers.\n\nThe contribution of this paper, besides the feature types evaluation, is an evaluation of a feature set derived from LibROSA toolkit  [8] . We compared both LLDs and HSF from selected LibROSA acoustic features to GeMAPS  [3]  and pyAudioAnalysis  [6] . We expect an improvement of performance from those two feature sets by utilizing a larger number of acoustic features, particularly on HSF feature type. Although the data is relatively small, i.e., about 1000 utterances for both song and speech, we choose deep learning-based classifiers to evaluate those features due to its simplicity. Other machine learning method, e.g., support vector machine, may obtain higher performance due to its effectiveness on smaller data.",

This dataset contains multimodal recordings of emotional speech and song on both audio and video formats. Speech includes seven emotion categories: calm, happy, sad, angry, fearful, surprise, and disgust expressions; a neutral with a total of 1440 utterances. Song includes five emotion categories: calm, happy, sad, angry, and fearful; and a neutral with a total of 1012 utterances. Both speech and song are recorded at 48 kHz.

      "text": "The first evaluated feature set for emotional speech and song is Geneva Minimalistic Acoustic Parameter Set (GeMAPS)  [3] . This feature set is a proposal to standardize acoustic features for voice and affective computing. Twenty-tree acoustic features, known as low-level descriptor (LLD), are chosen as minimalistic parameter set while the extended version contains added spectral and frequency related parameters and its functional. The extended version (eGeMAPS) consist of 88 parameters. This research used the minimalistic GeMAPS feature set due to its effectiveness compared to other features sets  [3, 1] .\n\nThe openSMILE toolkit  [4]  was used to extract 23 LLDs GeMAPS feature set for each time frame. That frame-based processing is conducted with 25 ms window length and 10 ms hop length resulting (523, 23) feature size for speech data and (633, 23) feature size for song data.\n\nThe second evaluated feature set is pyAudioAnalysis (pAA). pyAudioAnalysis was designed for general-purpose open-source Python library for audio signal analysis. The library provides a wide range of audio analysis procedures including: feature extraction, classification of audio signals, supervised and unsupervised segmentation, and content visualization  [6] . Thirty-four LLDs are extracted on frame-based processing from this feature set. Those LLDs, along with the previous GeMAPS and next LibROSA feature sets, are shown in Table  1 . As the final feature set, we selected five LLDs from LibROSA feature extractor including MFCCs, chroma, mel spectrogram, spectral contrast and tonnetz. The number of features for each LibROSA LLD is shown in Table  1  with a total of 193 features. This number of features is chosen based on experiments. The detail of LibROSA version used in this experiment can be found in  [8] .",

      "text": "The traditional method to extract acoustic feature from a speech is done on a framebased processing method, i.e., the aforementioned LLDs in each acoustic feature set. The higher level acoustic features can be extracted as statistical aggregation functions over LLDs on fixed-time processing, e.g., an average feature value of each 100 ms, 500 ms, 1 s, or per utterance. This high-level statistical functions (HSF) is intended to roughly describe the temporal variations and contours of the different LLDs over a fixed-time or an utterance  [9] . In dimensional speech emotion recognition, this HSF feature performs better than LLDs, as reported in  [2, 12, 10] .\n\nSchmitt and Schuller  [12]  evaluated mean and standard deviation (Mean+Std) of GeMAPS feature set and compared it with eGeMAPS and bag-of-audio-word (BoAW) representations of LLDs. The result showed that Mean+Std works best among the three. Based on this finding, we incorporated Mean+Std as HSFs from the previously explained three feature sets. The Mean+Std is calculated per utterance on each feature set resulting difference size/dimension for each feature set, i.e. 46-dimensional for GeMAPS, 68-dimensional for pyAudioAnalysis, and 386-dimensional for selected Li-bROSA features. Hence, two feature types are evaluated; LLD and HSF, from GeMAPS, pyAudioAnalysis and selected LibROSA features.",

Both results are presented in terms of accuracy and unweighted average recall (UAR). Accuracy is widely used to measure the classification error rate in balanced/near-balanced data. It defines the number of correctly classified examples divided by the total number of examples, usually presented in % (here we used 0-1 scale). UAR is an average recall from all classes, i.e., the number of correctly classified positive examples divided by the total number of positive examples in each class. UAR is widely used to justify classification method from imbalanced data.",

      "text": "Table  2  shows accuracy and UAR of different feature sets and feature types. On different feature types, LibROSA-based acoustic features perform best on both emotional song and speech data. On different feature sets, HSF features perform better than LLD, except on pyAudioAnalysis feature set for speech data. Only in that pyAudioAnalysis feature set LLDs of pyAudioAnalysis obtained better accuracy and UAR than its HSF. In overall evaluation, our proposal on using Mean+Std of LibROSA-based acoustic features perform best among six different features. This finding suggests that Mean+Std performs well not only on dimensional speech emotion recognition (regression task) but also on categorical song and speech emotion recognition.\n\nTo find in which emotion category our method performs best and worse, we performed confusion matrix presentation as shown in Figure  1  and 2 . We found featurespecific patterns on the detection of each emotional song category. For instance, the GeMAPS features, both LLD and HSF, obtained the lowest recall on the sad category while LibROSA HSF obtained high recall on this sad category. The happy category which obtained low scores on LLDs of pyAudioAnalysis and LibROSA obtained improvement on its HSFs. The highest and lowest recall scores vary for each feature on both song and speech data. On the speech data (Figure  2 ), LLD features shows best recall scores on calm category while HSF features obtained better score on neutral category. On both song and speech data, it was found the HSF improved recall scores of LLDs features. Since each feature has a different highest recall score, it is interesting to combine those features sets to improve the current result for future research direction.\n\nAlthough we found no remarkable different on the performance trends from the same features sets between emotional song and speech data, a significant difference maybe found on the using of specific acoustic features, e.g., F0 contour, spectral features and amplitude envelope, as reported in  [11]  for emotional singing voice.",

In overall evaluation, the LSTM classifier obtained the best result among other three. However, GRU classifier shows better UAR on song data, i.e., on recognizing each emotion category. This result shows that recurrent-based classifiers (LSTM and GRU) performs better than MLP and 1-dimensional convolution network on classification of emotional song and speech. Similar to the previous Table  2 , the song data showed higher scores than speech data. Since the song data contains fewer data (samples) and fewer emotion categories than speech data, it can be concluded that song is more emotional than speech. The result on the same classifier, same feature set, and same feature type supports this finding.",

First, we conclude that there is no remarkable difference between song and speech emotion recognition on the same features and classifiers based on the evaluated methods. In other words, the features types/sets and classifiers which gain better performance on song data will also gain better performance on speech data. Second, song is more emotional than speech. On both accuracy and unweighted average recall, the scores obtained by song data always higher than speech data. Both song and speech data contain the same statements; hence, the different is the intonation/prosody and other acoustic information which is captured by acoustic features. Third, on different feature types, high-level statistical functions consistently performed better than low-level descriptors. For the future research direction, we planned to combine different acoustic features types and sets since the result showed differences among emotion categories.",
