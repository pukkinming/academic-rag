      "text": "Multimodal emotion recognition in conversation (MERC) seeks to identify the speakers' emotions expressed in each utterance, offering significant potential across diverse fields. The challenge of MERC lies in balancing speaker modeling and context modeling, encompassing both long-distance and short-distance contexts, as well as addressing the complexity of multimodal information fusion. Recent research adopts graph-based methods to model intricate conversational relationships effectively. Nevertheless, the majority of these methods utilize a fixed fully connected structure to link all utterances, relying on convolution to interpret complex context. This approach can inherently heighten the redundancy in contextual messages and excessive graph network smoothing, particularly in the context of longdistance conversations. To address this issue, we propose a framework that dynamically adjusts hypergraph connections by variational hypergraph autoencoder (VHGAE), and employs contrastive learning to mitigate uncertainty factors during the reconstruction process. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposal against the state-of-the-art methods on IEMOCAP and MELD datasets.

      "text": "Emotion is one of the crucial characteristics of human behavior  [19] . Experienced psychiatrists can assess emotions by observing an individual's behavior, which serves as a key indicator for understanding their inclinations and responses. As human-computer interaction (HCI) advances, the capability to discern emotions from dialogues using multimodal information is becoming increasingly significant  [29, 41] . This process is commonly referred to as multimodal emotion recognition in conversation (MERC). The multimodality herein includes different modal information such as the speaker's language, tone, facial expression, body movement and so on  [6, 36] . From a modeling perspective, a conversation consists of a sequence of utterances. Each utterance contains one or more modalities of information and is linked to speaker information. The target of MERC is to identify the emotion category of each utterance by analyzing the available information and contextual cues.\n\nCompared with the emotion recognition in non-dialogue scenarios  [10] , MERC necessitates a specific emphasis on modelling the speakers involved in the dialogue. Also unlike the analysis of single-modal information  [9] , the processing of multimodal information demands the utilization of distinct processing techniques to extract meaningful information from various modalities. Different modalities of information need to be synthesized to facilitate the comprehensive analysis of a conversation. For example, when a speaker utters the word \"ok\" with a tone of helplessness, solely relying on textual cues may not fully convey the speaker's emotional state. By taking into account factors such as intonation and tone assist in inferring the underlying feeling of sadness expressed by the speaker. Efficient integration and utilization of multimodal information play a crucial role in enhancing the precision of emotion recognition during conversations  [31] .\n\nCurrent research methodologies regarding MERC can be classified into two main categories: non-graph-based method  [13, 24, 25]  and graph-based method  [3, 9, 12, 14, 21] . Non-graph-based method typically utilizes recurrent neural networks (RNN) or long short-term memory (LSTM) to capture contextual information, while the output utterance representations are used for label classification. However, these methods encounter challenges in modeling long-range dependencies because of issues in information propagation and gradient vanishing problems  [9] . Graph-based method typically uses a graph to depict a conversation, with each utterance represented as a node and the relationships between utterances shown through edge weights or connections between nodes. Contextual information is captured through graph convolutions, and the resulting node embeddings are fed into subsequent classification steps  [19] .\n\nGraph-based methods can be further divided into standard graph-based and hypergraph-based methods. Standard graph-based method  [9, 12, 14, 21]  is a typical graph-based method, which represents textual information in utterances as nodes and captures contextual relationships by connecting nodes with various types of edges within a specific window size. For the standard graph-based methods, the pairwise connection approach fails to depict the actual physical structure of MERC accurately. Additionally, as the number of graph convolution layers rises, the training time and storage requirements increase exponentially. It can also result in oversmoothing of the graph and redundancy of nodes, potentially leading to inaccurate assessments  [27] .\n\nHypergraph-based method changes the point-to-point connection to a hyperedge connection structure that more closely fits the model  [3] . Hypergraph is a special graph structure capable of capturing high-order correlations, enabling the exploration of more intricate relationships  [1] . By linking multiple modalities within a single utterance and connecting all nodes of the same modality using hyperedges, the hypergraph-based method can achieve outstanding performance improvement. Nevertheless, the fixed fully connected hypergraph structure still results in information redundancy, graph smoothing and slow convergence, especially when processing longdistance conversations  [38] .\n\nTo address the aforementioned issues in existing hypergraph-based methods, we propose a multimodal fusion framework via hypergraph autoencoder and contrastive learning named HAUCL for MERC, which is applicable to multimodal data and capable of adaptively adjusting hypergraph connections. The framework consists of five modules: (1) unimodal encoding, (2) hypergraph construction, (3) hypergraph convolution, (4) hypergraph contrastive learning, and (5) classifier. The unimodal encoding module is designed to generate modality-independent representations. For the hypergraph construction module, it firstly forms an initial fully connected hypergraph structure. Then, a variational hypergraph autoencoder (VHGAE)-based approach  [32]  is introduced to realize adaptive adjustment of the hypergraph. In this paper, we develop VHGAE to map the hypergraph to the latent space to obtain node and hyperedge by sampling from space, and then learn new connections via Gumbel-Softmax  [16] . The aforementioned procedures exhibit a degree of randomness. To minimize the influence of random factors, two parameter-sharing paths are established through the utilization of contrastive learning techniques: Two VHGAEs reconstruct the hypergraph, and the reconstructed hypergraphs are utilized in the subsequent hypergraph convolution module to learn the embeddings along with contextual information. Then, point-to-point hypergraph contrastive learning module is applied to the obtained two hypergraphs, where nodes corresponding to each other in different hypergraphs are considered positive sample pairs to ensure model stability. Conversely, other nodes are treated as negative sample pairs to enhance the learning of more distinctive embeddings. Finally, the learned embeddings are fed into the classifier module for emotion category prediction.\n\nThe main contributions of this paper are summarized as follows:\n\n• We propose a joint learning framework based on hypergraphs, which achieved synergistic optimization of hypergraph reconstruction, contrastive learning, and emotion recognition, leading to globally optimal performance. Specifically, VHGAE is integrated into MERC to adaptively adjust the hypergraph, while Gumbel-Softmax is devised to mitigate data overflow. • We utilize contrastive learning to mitigate the impact of uncertainty in the sampling process and the Gumbel-softmax learning process of VHGAE, enhancing the robustness and stability of the model. • Extensive experiments conducted on two mainstream MERC datasets, IEMOCAP and MELD, validate the effectiveness of our work. The results showed that our proposal performed superiorly compared to the state-of-the-art methods in accuracy and weighted F1 score.",

      "text": "Regarding the non-graph learning methods, BC-LSTM captures contextual information from surrounding utterances in three different modalities by using three independent bidirectional LSTM networks, and the output utterance representations are used for label classification  [25] . However, this method lacks the usage of speaker information and thus is not applicable to multi-person conversation scenarios. DialogueRNN utilizes three gate recurrent units (GRUs) to track the global context, speaker state, and emotion state throughout the entire dialogue, which effectively integrates speaker modeling, contextual modeling, and emotion modeling  [24] . To mimic the human reasoning process, DialogueCRN introduces reasoning modules to integrate the factors that make emotions happen  [13] .\n\nThe standard graph-based methods, such as DialogueGCN  [9] , represent textual information in utterances as nodes and capture contextual relationships through different types of edges connecting nodes within a given window size. The multimodal graph convolutional network (MMGCN) develops DialogueGCN by further incorporating audio and video modalities into the model  [14] . To address the challenge of cross-modal interaction in information fusion within ERC, MIMMN introduces a multi-view network that leverages complementary information from all modalities. It dynamically balances the relationships between all modalities during the fusion process  [33] . MM-DFN  [12]  uses a dynamic fusion mechanism to fully understand the context relationship between multiple modalities and reduce the redundancy between modalities. COGMEN  [17]  utilizes graph neural network (GNN) to leverage both local and global information in a conversation. GraphMFT  [21]  not only designs a multimodal fusion method based on graphs but also utilizes multiple graph attention networks (GATs) to capture the intra-modal contextual details and inter-modal complementary information. M3NET  [3]  introduces the hypergraph into the field of MERC. Through simple fully connected structures and randomly initialized edge weights, significant improvement in prediction accuracy and time efficiency has been achieved by multiple hypergraph convolutions.",

      "text": "A hypergraph acts as an extended version of the standard graph learning, specifically designed to extract high-order correlations within the data  [1, 39] . The examples of hypergraphs are shown on the left side of Figure  1 , with the corresponding standard graphs shown on the right side. The circular dots represent five nodes, i.e., from 𝑉 1 to 𝑉 5 . Curves with the same color form a hyperedge, and there are three hyperedges 𝑒 1 , 𝑒 2 , 𝑒 3 in total. In a hypergraph, connections are not limited to pairwise relationships as in a standard graph. Hyperedges can link multiple nodes together, and a single node can be linked by multiple hyperedges simultaneously. Meanwhile a hypergraph can include multiple types of hyperedges, representing multiple meanings. In this paper, we create a hypergraph in which all utterances linked to the same speaker are grouped together on a hyperedge, while also connecting similar modality into another hyperedge. This structure closely resembles the physical structure of certain models, capturing higher-order correlations and minimizing information loss during the modeling process. The effectiveness of hypergraph learning in solving the association problem of multimodal data has already been verified in various applications, such as including recommendation system  [34] , video segmentation  [35] , sleep stage classification  [23, 40] , and drug-target interaction prediction  [28] .\n\nRegarding hypergraph convolutions, the learning process involves aggregating node information onto connected hyperedges with varying weights, followed by sending messages from the hyperedges back to the connected nodes. This process is not constrained by distance, thereby mitigating the limitations of message transmission during the process  [7] . These benefits are particularly pronounced in long-distance transmissions  [8] . Therefore, the hypergraph learning process is anticipated to be effective in the MERC task, as speakers frequently discuss topics that are distant from the current conversation, utilizing long-distance cues.",

Following the approach outlined in M3NET  [3] , features from visual modalities are extracted using DenseNet  [15]  or 3D-CNN  [37] , depending on the adopted dataset. Features from acoustic and textual modalities are extracted using the OpenSmile toolkit  [5]  and the RoBERTa large model  [22]  respectively.\n\nAs mentioned above, incorporating contextual information is crucial for emotion category prediction in conversations. To enhance discourse feature representation, we employ various encoding methods tailored to the characteristics of different modalities. Specifically, we utilize GRU network  [4]  to encode context information for the textual modality, while acoustic and visual information is encoded using two fully connected multilayer perceptrons (MLPs). To facilitate the information fusion across modalities, we normalize the encoded dimension to a unified 𝑑 dimension as below:\n\nwhere 𝑢 𝑖 is the input of unimodal encoding.

      "text": "3.2.2 VHGAE. The fully connected hypergraph generated in the structure initialization stage may lead to redundancy in the subsequent update process, impeding the classification of subtle differences. To mitigate this challenge, we introduce VHGAE to reconstruct the hypergraph, aiming to identify the most appropriate hypergraph structure. VHGAE comprises of three processes: encoder, sampler, and decoder. The structure of VHGAE is illustrated in Figure  3 .\n\nEncoder: It aims to project the hypergraph into a representation consisting of sets of nodes and hyperedges. This projection can facilitate the subsequent decoding process of the non-Euclidean structure, as highlighted in the original paper that proposed variational graph auto-encoders (VGAE)  [20] .\n\nIn our proposed method, we follow the VHGAE framework and utilize a hypergraph neural network (HyperGNN) to perform hypergraph convolution on the original hypergraph. This convolution operation produces embeddings for both the nodes 𝑣 and the hyperedges 𝜖 as:\n\nWe utilize the obtained embeddings to encode the mean 𝜇 and variance 𝜎 vectors for each type 𝑘 ∈ (𝑣, 𝜖 ). This encoding process involves applying linear transformations and activation functions, as described by the following equations:\n\nwhere 𝑊 𝑘 and 𝑏 𝑘 are learnable parameters specific to the type 𝑘. The activation functions 𝜎 and 𝜎 1 correspond to the ReLU and Softplus functions, respectively. Through encoding the mean and variance vectors with node and hyperedge embeddings, we can effectively capture and represent the crucial information regarding the hypergraph's structure within a latent space.\n\nThese encoded vectors will play a pivotal role in the subsequent stages, enabling the generation of meaningful and relevant outputs.\n\nSample: To incorporate the reparametrization trick, we utilize sampling in the latent space to obtain new nodes and hyperedge embeddings. The sampling process introduces stochasticity while ensuring differentiable computations during the training phase.\n\nTo generate the new embeddings, we use the mean 𝜇 𝑘 and variance 𝜎 𝑘 vectors obtained from the encoder process by Equations 6a and 6b. The reparametrization trick involves sampling from a standard normal distribution 𝛿 ∼ 𝑁 (0, 1) and scaling it by the standard deviation 𝜎 𝑘 . The obtained sample is then added element-wise to the mean vector 𝜇 𝑘 to obtain the new embedding 𝑚 𝑘 by:\n\nwhere ⊙ represents the element-wise product between 𝜎 𝑘 and 𝛿. By incorporating the sampled noise 𝛿 into the latent space representation, we introduce randomness to the model, while maintaining differentiability for efficient optimization.\n\nThe obtained embeddings 𝑚 𝑘 serve as the updated representations for the output nodes or hyperedges, capturing the variability and uncertainty within the hypergraph structure.\n\nDecoder: This process aims to reconstruct the hypergraph from the latent space representation. By leveraging the updated embeddings obtained from the encoder process, we can recover the connection structure of the new hypergraph through a series of operations.\n\nFirst, we calculate the matrix ℎ 𝑖 by taking the dot product between the transpose of 𝑚 𝜖 and 𝑚 𝜎 by:\n\nwhere 𝑚 𝑇 𝜎 represents the inverse of 𝑚 𝜎 . Next, we apply the Gumbel-Softmax function to the matrix ℎ with a temperature coefficient 𝜏 to introduce stochasticity:\n\nIn the above equation, Gumbel_Softmax is a function that applies the Gumbel-Softmax relaxation. To prevent data overflow, we incorporate the addition of a constant 𝑝 to the Gumbel-Softmax operation and subsequently apply the softmax function.\n\nAfter conducting the softmax operation, The obtained matrix ℎ has two columns, representing a distribution over the hypergraph connections. We extract the first column of matrix ℎ, which corresponds to the incidence matrix of the new hypergraph G 0 = ( V, E 0 ).\n\nBy obtaining the connection structure of the new hypergraph through the decoder, we can reconstruct the relationships and connections between nodes and hyperedges. This reconstructed hypergraph can then be further utilized for various downstream tasks.\n\nLoss function: The loss function in VHGAE consists of primary components designed to produce a reconstructed hypergraph that closely resembles the original one. Specifically, the first component measures the Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence between the distributions of the latent variables (nodes and hyperedges) and their corresponding prior distributions. The second component quantifies the difference in connection structure between the newly generated hypergraph and the original hypergraph. The VHGAE's loss function L 𝑔 is defined as follows:\n\nwhere KL(𝑚 𝜎 , 𝜎 ) measures the KL divergence between the distribution of the sampled latent variables 𝑚 𝜎 and the prior distribution 𝜎. Similarly, KL(𝑚 𝜖 , 𝜖 ) represents the KL divergence between the distribution of the sampled hyperedge embeddings 𝑚 𝜖 and the prior distribution 𝜖. The third term CE(ℎ 0 , ℎ) denotes the cross-entropy loss function, quantifying the connection structure difference between the original hypergraph ℎ 0 and the generated hypergraph ℎ. This component ensures that the generated hypergraph closely matches the original hypergraph regarding the distribution of connections. By minimizing this loss function, VHGAE aims to learn an effective latent space representation that captures the essential characteristics of the hypergraph while preserving its connection structure.",

This operation enables the information propagation from hyperedges to their incident nodes.

However, when this value is excessively large, it will impact the loss of emotion recognition, i.e., when 𝜆 𝑐𝑙 exceeds 1.1, there is a degradation in accuracy performance as plotted in Figure  4b .\n\nHypergraph layer 𝐿: Figure  4c  demonstrates that increasing the number of covolutional layers in a hypergraph does not necessarily lead to enhanced accuracy performance. A large value of 𝐿 not only amplifies the model's complexity and runtime, but also risks oversmoothing, potentially complicating the differentiation of emotions with similar characteristics. When 𝐿 is 5, there is a sharp decrease in accuracy performance, indicating an over-smoothing phenomenon.\n\nBatch size: The selection of batch size is a crucial factor that impacts the performance of recognition  [11, 18] . Given the non-uniform distribution of MELD dataset, employing a batch size that is too small can render the model susceptible to the interference of small samples, leading to significant gradient fluctuations and convergence challenges. Conversely, an excessively large batch size may prompt the model to overly generalize, potentially compromising accuracy. As depicted in Figure  4d , the best performance is attained with a batch size of 12.",

The results are summarized in Table  3 .   Impact of Speaker Embedding: Speaker embedding can distinguish the input features from different speakers. Existing research has shown that incorporating speaker information can enhance the accuracy of emotion recognition tasks  [14] . The exclusion of speaker embedding (\"w/o SE\" in Table  3 ) results in a decrease in accuracy, with a degradation of 1.11% and 0.81% observed on IEMOCAP and MELD datasets, respectively. These findings indicate that incorporating person modeling can enhance the model's performance in the MERC domain.\n\nImpact of VHGAE and Contrastive Learning: We utilize VHGAE for dynamic hyperedge selection to minimize redundancy and employ contrastive learning to mitigate random errors. In Table  3 , \"w/o GCL\" indicates the direct fusion of two hypergraph convolutions without the inclusion of VHGAE and contrastive learning module. The results demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed HAUCL: It can improve the accuracy performance by 0.78% and 0.43% on IEMOCAP and MELD datasets respectively.\n\nImpact of Contrastive Learning: \"w/o CL\" in Table  3  refers to the model that incorporates hypergraph and VHGAE without the integration of contrastive learning. The experimental results indicate a 0.98% enhancement in accuracy on IEMOCAP dataset and a 0.58% improvement on MELD dataset. These results verify that the contrastive learning module effectively",

To visualize these representations in a more comprehensive manner, we employ t-SNE  [30]  method for dimensionality reduction, transforming the obtained nodes into three dimensions. Furthermore, we assign distinct colors to indicate the true labels of the nodes. By comparing the two figures in Figure  5 , it is evident that the data points depicted in Figure  5a  (our method) exhibit greater separation, resulting in a more discriminative segmentation. As aforementioned, the representations derived from the proposed HAUCL exhibit reduced redundancy and enhanced discriminability, thereby enabling the attainment of superior outcomes.",

This framework aims to address the issue of excessive redundancy stemming from the fully connected structure of graphs or hypergraphs. The proposed method HAUCL effectively integrates hypergraph adaptive reconstruction and contrastive learning, which reduces information redundancy and enhances accuracy.\n\nExperimental results verify the superiority of our proposed method against state-of-the-art ones. In the future, we expect to integrate external knowledge, such as large language models (LLM), into our framework. By focusing on linear labels such as valence-arousal-dominance (VAD) in dimensional emotion space, we aim to substitute classification labels with the goal of enhancing machines' comprehension of human behavior.",
