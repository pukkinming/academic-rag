      "text": "In the latest social networks, more and more people prefer to express their emotions in videos through text, speech, and rich facial expressions. Multimodal video emotion analysis techniques can help understand users' inner world automatically based on human expressions and gestures in images, tones in voices, and recognized natural language. However, in the existing research, the acoustic modality has long been in a marginal position as compared to visual and textual modalities. That is, it tends to be more difficult to improve the contribution of the acoustic modality for the whole multimodal emotion recognition task. Besides, although better performance can be obtained by introducing common deep learning methods, the complex structures of these training models always result in low inference efficiency, especially when exposed to highresolution and long-length videos. Moreover, the lack of a fully end-to-end multimodal video emotion recognition system hinders its application. In this paper, we designed a fully multimodal video-to-emotion system (named FV2ES) for fast yet effective recognition inference, whose benefits are threefold: (1) The adoption of the hierarchical attention method upon the sound spectra breaks through the limited contribution of the acoustic modality, and outperforms the existing models' performance on both IEMOCAP and CMU-MOSEI datasets; (2) the introduction of the idea of multi-scale for visual extraction while single-branch for inference brings higher efficiency and maintains the prediction accuracy at the same time; (3) the further integration of data pre-processing into the aligned multimodal learning model allows the significant reduction of computational costs and storage space. Source code will be available in https://github.com/qlwei89/FV2ES if this paper is accepted.",

      "text": "ITH the rapid development of social networks, more people choose to use videos to express their emotions and opinions. The modern technique of multimodal emotion recognition can help understand these emotions through text, speech, facial expressions, gestures, postures, etc. In the existing multimodal-based video emotion recognition work, we observe three distinct limitations. Firstly, acoustic modality features are usually extracted by the OpenSmile toolkit  [1]  or RNN-based deep learning networks  [2, 3, 4] . Though these global spectrum features or coarse-grained audio information are useful for the overall multimodal recognition task, it seems that the contribution of the acoustic modality is relatively low as compared to visual and textual modalities, which affects the improvement of the video emotion recognition performance. Secondly, 5G networks allow people to easily record and share high-definition videos through their mobile phones anytime and anywhere. Meanwhile, in the era of self-media, the low threshold of video lease has significantly increased the number and the length of videos. However, although recent deep learning networks  [5, 6, 7, 8, 9]  adopted for the visual modality led to better performance, they cannot cope with the abovementioned computing and storage challenges due to the complex structures. Thirdly, throughout the entire field of multimodal video emotion recognition, the research has always stayed at the academic level. Most existing non-endto-end frameworks  [10, 11, 12]  own pipelines with combined models that aim to obtain better performance; however, this kind of slow and incoherent method hindered the application of multimodal video emotion recognition.\n\nIn this paper, we aim to address the above limitations by designing a fully multimodal video-to-emotion system for fast yet effective recognition inference, whose main flow and components are illustrated in Fig.  1 . In this system, the original video is taken as the input. The method of hierarchical attention is used to extract features for each spectral patch of the audio modality to enhance the effect of the audio modality. At the same time, we adopt multi-branch feature learning and single-branch inference structure, so that we can extract the frames' information of visual modality and simplify the inference model. For text modalities, we adopt Albert  [13]  to extract textual features. And we use the basic transformer  [14]  to obtain the visual and acoustic sequential information. Finally, multimodal fusion is performed through a feedforward network. Specifically, through sound spectrum segmentation, intrablock self-attention, and block aggregation processing, we extract the layered spectral features to obtain the internal relationship information of the audio spectrum. At the same time, for video frames, we adopt the structure of multi-branch feature learning and single-branch inference. During training, the advantages of multi-branch feature learning are used to extract the information of video frames. In the inference process, we choose the single-branch structure for prediction, which is simpler and more computationally efficient. We take their respective strengths and realize their connection through parameter migration, which can compress the computational loss and ensure the learning of frame features. Simultaneously, to realize the comprehensive connection between the input video and the procedure of emotion analysis, we integrate the data pre-processing into the multimodal emotion analysis model.",

      "text": "Over the past few years, multimodal emotion recognition has been a widely studied academic topic for various research tasks such as human-machine communication  [30] , action recognition  [31] , online advertising recommendation  [32]  and Video Q&A  [33, 34] . In Table  I , we show almost all of the existing popular multimodal emotion recognition research. From the \"Modality\" column, we can find that all of the multimodal emotion recognition methods considered both visual (V) and textual (T) modalities. It is worth noting that in some studies, researchers studied only V and T modalities while ignoring the acoustic (A) modality  [7, 9] . \"Effect\" in this table refers to the performance effect of three modalities on common datasets and evaluation standards, and it seems that the contribution of the acoustic modality was always the lowest. This kind of low contribution mostly embodies two aspects. On one hand, the emotion recognition performance of modality A is worst compared to modality V and T. For example, in HFU-BERT  [6] , VGGish & SoundNet were used to extract audio information and the acoustic modality played the auxiliary role (F1-scores on the CMU-MOSEI dataset equal 0.74, 0.72, 0.56 for modality V, T, A respectively). On the other hand, it seems more difficult to improve the performance of modality A in multimodal emotion recognition research. For instance, the ablation experiments in  [22]  show that accuracies were increased by 7.4%, 9.6% while only 6.7% on the CMU-MOSEI dataset for modalities V, T, and A respectively.\n\nIn addition, looking at the \"Visual processing\" column in Table  I , we can see that after the year 2015, almost all of the researchers tend to introduce deep learning networks (Cross-modal Transformer  [23] , ResNet50  [6] ) to obtain deeper visual features for better multimodal emotion prediction effect. However, deeper networks own more complex structures, leading to lower computing efficiency for inference and more demands for storage memories. Thus, deep learning inference models may not function well in the current 5G and self-media era, where videos with higher resolution and longer length are leased and shared. This practical problem has yet to be addressed in the existing research.\n\nMoreover, the \"System implementation\" column shows that there is still no attempt to build a multimodal video-to-emotion system to promote practical application, and that may be due to the non-end2end structures. Specifically, in  [10] , late fusion  [11, 12] , and later tensor fusion  [35] , manual feature learning or common pretrained deep learning models were usually combined  [7, 23] . This can result in the unaligned fusion relationship among the V, T, and A modalities in the training and inference procedure. Though Dai W et al.  [5]  made a breakthrough by realizing end-to-end aligned multimodal features learning, this model needed the data pre-processing module and thus it still has not reached the full consistency from data input to emotion prediction.",

      "text": "In order to bridge the gap between the contributions to the final emotion prediction results of the acoustic modality and the other two modalities, and inspired by the outstanding performance of nesting transformers  [36]  applied in image classification, we design a novel hierarchical-attention spectrum computing module to get fine-grained spectral information. Fig.  2  illustrates the structure of the module proposed in this section. The right panel of this figure looks like a three-layer pyramid, where spectrum maps at various layers are included. And the left panel shows the procedure of generating hierarchical spectrum maps. Specifically, the initial spectrum is obtained through Melscale filter banks. The input of the hierarchical-attention spectrum computing module is a reshaped 𝐻𝐻 × 𝑊𝑊 sound spectrum, where 𝐻𝐻 = 𝑊𝑊. And this input is divided into 16 patches of equal size 𝑆𝑆 × 𝑆𝑆 (where\n\n), and these little patches are called the first-layer spectrum maps. After segmentation, we use the Transformer Layer for each spectral patch. Inside the Transformer Layer, we firstly embed the patch of size 𝑆𝑆 × 𝑆𝑆 as a 𝑑𝑑-dimensional vector:\n\nwhere 𝐼𝐼 refers to a patch size of 𝑆𝑆 × 𝑆𝑆.\n\nThen, the basic transformer  [14]  is adopted on each ddimensional vector to extract local self-attention acoustic features. And the LN  [37]  and GELU  [38]  operations are performed on the features to get the output of the first layer:\n\nwhere 𝑂𝑂 1 represents the output of the first layer, MSA is the multi-head attention of the basic transformer. As shown in Fig.  2 , every four spatially adjacent patches are merged into one block through a 3 × 3 CNN followed by LayerNorm  [37]  and a 3 × 3 max pooling layer. The aggregated four blocks are termed as the second-layer spectrum maps:\n\nwhere 𝐼𝐼 2 is the input of the second layer. With regard to the second layer, each block is again fed into the basic transformer  [14]  and then these four blocks are combined. The result is the input of the third layer 𝐼𝐼 3 , which is passed through the basic transformer to get the final fused spectrum map.\n\nOverall, we extract acoustic hierarchical spectral information through sound spectrum segmentation, intrapatch (block) self-attention, and patch (block)  aggregation. In this way, we take full advantage of the internal relationship of the acoustic data, making up for the limitations of the previous work in which the global and coarse-grained acoustic information is extracted.",

In Fig.  3 , we show the training and the inference models adopted for the visual modality, whose structure is based on 3 × 3 convolution, 1 × 1 convolution, Identity, and ReLU activation layers  [40] . In the left panel of this figure, we can see that spatial-visual feature is learned mainly through multi-branch and multi-kernel convolutions. As shown in Fig.  3 , for the input image frame, we use three branches to extract multi-dimensional features, including the 3 × 3 convolution branch, the 1 × 1 convolution branch, and the Identify branch. Then the middle features are fused as the input of the ReLU layer  [40]  to obtain the final result.\n\nThe right panel of Fig.  3  shows the inference procedure, instead of the original clunky multi-branch structure, we choose a purer single-branch structure. And the middle panel shows the details of the process of parameter migration from training models to inference models, in which a three-channel input is taken as an example. Specifically, among the three branches in training models, only the 3 × 3 convolution branch is retained while the 1 × 1 convolution kernel is transformed to 3 × 3 convolution by zero padding. It is worth noting that each convolution here contains a BN layer  [41] .\n\nThe original RepVGG used a model architecture similar to ResNet in order to benchmark the SOTA model. However, the problem we face is that of improving the processing efficiency of video image frames when dealing with a lot of high-definition videos. Thus, we use the multi-branch training and single-branch prediction ideas of RepVGG to achieve this target. And we hope to improve inference efficiency with a simpler structure. Hence, we combine a 3 × 3 convolution, a 1 × 1 convolution and Identity as one layer, and finally use such six layers as the visual module structure for the target task.",

      "text": "Although some video sentiment analysis also performs preprocessing operations, they often choose to store modal information files after video processing. Then the model calls the modal information file for inference analysis. In this process, the memory and efficiency waste generated by storage, generation and invocation, we think, unnecessary. We want to solve the \"last mile\" problem by decreasing the unnecessary computational storage waste. Thus, we designed a \"fully video to emotion system\" (FV2ES), which directly interfaces the preprocessed modal information with the V2EM input in order to reduce the waste of previous systems.\n\nIn this subsection, we take the first step to think outside of the existing academic research on multimodal video emotion recognition. Fig.  4  illustrates the data flow of FV2ES, in which the whole process including data uploading, features extraction, and the final emotion prediction is coherent. In FV2ES, long videos are allowed to be taken as the input, and the complete dialogue texts and the audio Mel-spectrogram of the input videos are obtained firstly. At the same time, the image frames need to be preprocessed. Take the videos in the IEMOCAP dataset, for instance. Here the two-person dialogue videos are divided into one-person frames according to the characters. Long videos are too verbose and cause computational overhead. To solve this problem, we divide the whole video into several short video segments. At the same time, we use the timeline to align the data of the three modalities. We select the text, spectrum, and image frames in the same period and take these directly as input to V2EM. Then we can obtain the emotion prediction of this period through V2EM. Finally, the emotional prediction values of multiple short videos are taken as the emotional prediction result of the input video.\n\nBased on the Flask technology, we build FV2ES which is expected to enhance the industrial application value of multimodal video emotion analysis. Users can upload the videos to be analyzed at the front end of the platform while these modality data will be computed at the back end. The obtained emotional scores and the final prediction will be printed on our designed interface.",

In Table  II , we show the results of V2EM on the IEMOCAP dataset.\n\nCompared to baselines, the weighted accuracy of V2EM is outstanding (15.46% improved compared to LF-LSTM, 5.20% improved compared to LF-TRANS,10.9% improved compared to EmoEmbs, and 5.30% improved compared to MulT). Such excellent results confirm the superiority of the V2EM structure. Since FE2E performs best in the existing SOTA models and it used the same text processing method as V2EM, we choose FE2E as the reference model to observe the effects of V2EM in the 30 epochs training process. As shown in Fig.  5 , during 30 epochs, the performance of V2EM is significantly better than that of FE2E (1.22% improved), and the good performance is maintained stably. We further evaluate the results of V2EM on the CMU-MOSEI dataset as shown in Table  III  and Fig.  5 . We observe similar trends on this dataset. (10.78% improved compared to LF-LSTM, 9.05% improved compared to LF-TRANS, 5.70% improved compared to EmoEmbs, 4.50% improved compared to MulT and 1.16% improved compared to the best SOTA model FE2E  [5] ).\n\nAblation Experiments. To better explore the effect of the hierarchical-attention spectrum computing module and the RepVGG-based single-branch inference module on multimodal video emotion prediction, we conduct ablation experiments, in which the VGG16 model is used to process the visual and auditory data, and the Alert model is adopted to extract textual features. Then we use the hierarchicalattention spectrum computing module and the RepVGGbased single-branch inference module respectively on the basis of the basic model to observe the prediction performance.  As shown in Table  IV  and Table  V , the introduction of the audio module effectively improves the performance on these two public datasets. On the IEMOCAP dataset, 𝑊𝑊 𝐴𝐴𝐴𝐴𝐴𝐴 . in the V+A(Ours)+T model equals 0.8223, which is 0.38% improved compared to the baseline, and the F1 score is 0.36% improved compared to the baseline. Similarly, on the CMU-MOSEI dataset, the adoption of the audio module makes 𝑊𝑊 𝐴𝐴𝐴𝐴𝐴𝐴 . 1.14% improved. At the same time, the performance of the V+A(Ours)+T model on both datasets is significantly better than that of V(Ours)+A+T, indicating that the audio modality has a greater contribution to the overall multimodal emotion recognition results. Here, it can be seen that the effect of V(Ours)+A+T is not as good as that of baselines. We believe this is due to the relative simplicity of our six-layers visual structure compared to the VGG-16 structure used by the baseline. Thus, there is less performance improvement. However, our original intention of designing the RepVGG-based single-branch inference module is to bring efficiency improvements, which is demonstrated in the subsequent analysis. Thus, its lack of performance is something we can tolerate. Therefore, the above experiments show that the proposed V2EM using the hierarchical-attention spectrum computing module can solve the problem that the contribution of the audio modality is relatively low in the existing multimodal models.\n\nTo make further analysis of the reason for the good performance of the hierarchical-attention spectrum computing module proposed in section III-A, we show a visualization of audio attention maps in Fig.  6 . In this figure, we take the first audio clip of Ses01M_script03_2 in the IEMOCAP dataset as the example. The audio attention maps of each layer are extracted through the self-attention module of three layers. On the far left is the original Mel spectrogram. Reshape Mel Spectrum to get the input of the audio module, as shown in the \"Input\". After being processed by the first Transformer layer of the audio module, the 16 attention maps shown in \"Layer 1\" are obtained. The warm areas represent the focused regions of the attention layers. We can observe that the features of the hierarchical-attention spectrum computing module focus on more subtle internal relationships of audio features in early attention layers. Then, after Aggregation and the second Transformer layer, 4 audio attention maps are obtained as shown in \"Layer 2\". Its warm area becomes larger. At the same time, as shown in \"Layer 3\", the warm area in the attention map obtained after the third Transformer layer is larger. It can be seen that the information on the internal features of the final fusion sound spectrum can be obtained after hierarchical extraction. Therefore, we can say that the proposed audio module can extract more fine-grained, locally high and low audio spectral features, thus leading to the enhancement of the acoustic contribution to the overall multimodal emotion recognition performance.\n\n2) The Inference Efficiency of V2EM Comparative Experiments. In Table  II  and Table  III , we show the prediction speed of V2EM on the IEMOCAP dataset and the CMU-MOSEI dataset. V2EM is the proposed end-to-end model for multimodal video-toemotion prediction. And FE2E is the best end-to-end prediction model in the SOTAs. From these two tables, we can find that the computing efficiency of V2EM is outstanding (On the IEMOCAP dataset, 51.95% improved compared to FE2E while 21.42% improved on the CMU-MOSEI dataset).",

      "text": "In this paper, we transfer the success of VIT to the audio modality for the multimodal emotion recognition task. Taking layered audio spectrum information into consideration can effectively improve the results of emotion classification, and meanwhile it can also promote the contribution of the acoustic modality compared to the visual and textual modalities for the overall multimodal task. In addition, we introduce the RepVGG-based single-branch inference module for visual frames. In this module, the \"big and whole\" instead of \"small and fragmented\" reasoning structure brings much higher computing efficiency and requires less storage space. And therefore, we expect this vision module to help solve the computational and storage problem caused by a large amount of long-length and high-resolution videos in the 5G and self-media era. Moreover, we designed a fully multimodal video-to-emotion system in which the data pre-processing and the multimodal end-to-end learning model are integrated. This operation leads to the further enhancement of the inference efficiency. Above all, the proposed FV2ES in this paper for fast yet effective video emotion recognition inference is valuable in academic study and also applicable for practical industry.\n\nHowever, FV2ES still has some shortcomings. Fig.  7  illustrates the results of the confusion matrix. We can observe that the method proposed in this paper has the best recognition performance on emotion \"excitement\". The main reason is that the excitement is more often expressed in speech and intonation, and the proposed audio module functions well in extracting fine-grained acoustic information (as shown in the confusion matrix A modality). But for similar emotional expressions like happy and neutral, people express subtle differences in expressions, dialogues, and voices, and our model does not perform well in discriminating these emotions.\n\nAt the same time, the video scenes in the public IEMOCAP and CMU-MOSEI datasets used in this paper are relatively pure instead of in the wild. Specifically, the environment in these videos is quiet and there is almost no noise. Furthermore, there are easily recognizable core characters in the frames. Such clean datasets are still far from the real world. In the future, we will optimize V2EM to improve the performance and migrate FV2ES to short video data in social networks. And we are going to take the visual processing of complex backgrounds, noisy audio, and random text processing into account, so as to promote more links between the multimodal video emotion analysis academic research and industry application.",
