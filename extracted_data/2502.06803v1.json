      "text": "Emotion recognition and generation have emerged as crucial topics in Artificial Intelligence research, playing a significant role in enhancing human-computer interaction within healthcare, customer service, and other fields. Although several reviews have been conducted on emotion recognition and generation as separate entities, many of these works are either fragmented or limited to specific methodologies, lacking a comprehensive overview of recent developments and trends across different modalities. In this survey, we provide a holistic review aimed at researchers beginning their exploration in emotion recognition and generation. We introduce the fundamental principles underlying emotion recognition and generation across facial, vocal, and textual modalities. This work categorises recent state-of-the-art research into distinct technical approaches and explains the theoretical foundations and motivations behind these methodologies, offering a clearer understanding of their application. Moreover, we discuss evaluation metrics, comparative analyses, and current limitations, shedding light on the challenges faced by researchers in the field. Finally, we propose future research directions to address these challenges and encourage further exploration into developing robust, effective, and ethically responsible emotion recognition and generation systems.",

      "text": "Emotions are central to human communication, shaping interactions through body language, facial expressions, vocal intonations, and textual cues  [1] . Psychological research suggests recognition of emotions is innate in humans, with newborns able to replicate facial expressions and vocal tones as early as two days old  [2] . Understanding emotions aids in teamwork and cooperation, a concept recognised by Darwin's theories on survival mechanisms  [3] . This significance has led to the development of emotion models like Ekman and Friesen's Facial Action Coding System (FACS), which categorises emotions such as anger, disgust, fear, happiness, sadness, surprise, and contempt  [4, 5] , forming the basis for many contemporary emotion recognition systems.\n\nAs interest in artificial intelligence (AI) grows, emotion recognition and generation technologies have gained traction in fields such as healthcare, customer service, education, and entertainment  [6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11] . AI systems can now analyse and simulate emotional responses, allowing machines to engage in more meaningful human-computer interactions. Emotion recognition is used in applications such as driver fatigue detection  [12]  and lie detection  [13] , while generative models create realistic emotional content in apps like FaceApp  [14] , HeadSpace  [15] , and Wysa  [16] .\n\nThis survey provides a comprehensive review of State-of-the-Art (SOTA) methodologies in AI for emotion recognition and emotion generation, addressing the gap in the literature regarding the integration of these two domains and their applications across multiple modalities. The generation of emotions on faces, Facial Expression Generation (FEG) systems, are termed in the literature as Talking Face or Speech/Text-to-Animation models, while Speech Emotion Generation (SEG) involves Speech-to-Speech or Speech Reenactment methods, and Text Sentiment Generation (TSG) relies on Large Language Models (LLMs). Existing reviews have typically focused on either emotion recognition  [17, 18, 19]  or emotion generation  [20, 21] , without addressing their intersection. Additionally, Facial Expression Recognition (FER) and FEG have not yet been discussed alongside Speech Emotion Recognition (SER), SEG, or Text Sentiment Recognition (TSR). Research tends to prioritise facial systems due to heightened public interest and the relative ease with which facial expressions are interpreted by both humans and machines  [22] . These systems also benefit from extensive pretrained models and datasets derived from computer vision research  [23] . By exploring both emotion recognition and generation across modalities, this survey aims to offer insights into current techniques, highlight areas for improvement, and guide future research directions. This survey is structured to provide a holistic examination of the field. Section 1.1 explores various applications of emotion recognition and generation models. Section 2 discusses preprocessing techniques to improve model accuracy and efficiency. Section 3 reviews the datasets commonly used, detailing their characteristics. Sections 4 and 5 present state-of-the-art methods for emotion recognition and generation, respectively, across faces, speech, and text. Section 5.4 discusses emotion control methods accross modalities. Section 6 provides a comparative analysis of evaluation metrics to assess SOTA performance. Section 7 outlines current challenges and future research directions. Finally, Section 9 concludes with a synthesis of key findings and contributions to the development of emotion recognition and generation technologies.",

In customer service, they are utilised to discern customers' emotions and evaluate the effectiveness of sales assistants' communication strategies through assessment of transcripts  [7] . Similarly, at self-service checkouts, FER is used to gauge customer satisfaction based on their facial cues  [6] . In healthcare, these systems assist in tracking the progression of Alzheimer's disease  [8] , facilitating therapy sessions  [9] , and supporting individuals with Asperger's Syndrome in recognising emotions  [24] . They are also used in robotics to interpret human emotions during interactions with machines  [10] , and in educational settings to evaluate students' engagement and learning  [11] . Other applications include lie detection  [13]  and monitoring driver fatigue levels  [12] .\n\nEmotion recognition systems can also serve as foundational tools for training models capable of generating realistic emotional content  [22] . These models can be used to create visual virtual assistants and avatars for virtual calls  [25] . As reliance on chatbots for social interactions and advice increases  [26] , there is a growing opportunity for the development of talking head chatbots. Such chatbots would use speech or text input-whether from a customer service representative, therapist, or a text generation model-to produce animated faces with lifelike emotions in real-time. These animated avatars could integrate with AI models such as Character.AI  [27] , ChatGPT  [28] , Llama  [29] , or Gemini  [30]  to function as therapeutic or customer service bots. This technology has the potential to provide users with a highly immersive and personalised experience, enhancing or even replacing current customer service chatbots.",

      "text": "Preprocessing is an important stage in deep learning pipelines, particularly when handling data obtained from uncontrolled or 'in-the-wild' environments, such as facial and speech data extracted from movies or textual data from social media. Such data often exhibit significant variability compared to controlled laboratory settings, with variations in background, lighting, noise, and other artefacts. To address these challenges, preprocessing typically involves standard steps like data normalisation, noise reduction, and feature extraction to ensure data consistency and optimise model performance. Below, we explore the specific preprocessing techniques used for processing face, speech, and textual data.",

      "text": "Preprocessing for facial emotion recognition systems aims to enhance image quality, standardise data, and extract critical features for accurate model predictions. The initial step involves resizing and cropping facial images to create uniform input dimensions, ensuring consistency across the dataset. By eliminating background elements and focusing on the region of interest, these techniques enable models to concentrate on key facial features. Normalisation, through scaling pixel values to a common range (e.g., 0 to 1 or -1 to 1), ensures uniform pixel intensity across different samples, thereby enhancing the model's capacity to learn relevant patterns. Common methods such as mean subtraction  [31]  and standard deviation normalisation  [32]  are frequently used. Noise reduction techniques, like Gaussian blurring  [33]  and median filtering  [34] , are used to minimise the impact of noise introduced during image acquisition or transmission.\n\nTechniques such as histogram equalisation  [35]  improve contrast by redistributing pixel intensities, enhancing visibility in images captured under challenging conditions. Data augmentation, involving transformations like rotation, scaling, and flipping, increases training data diversity and mitigates overfitting  [36] . Furthermore, advanced algorithms such as Haar cascades  [37]  and deep learning-based facial landmark detection methods  [38]  are applied to extract and align facial regions, standardising poses and reducing variability. Feature extraction models, such as VGG  [39] , ResNet  [40] , and MobileNet  [41] , are widely used for extracting high-level features. Colour space transformations and quality control measures help streamline data preparation, ensuring only high-quality data is fed into the models  [33, 42] .",

      "text": "The primary goals of preprocessing in speech systems are noise reduction, normalisation, segmentation, and feature extraction from raw audio signals. Noise reduction methods like spectral subtraction  [43] , Wiener filtering  [44] , and adaptive filtering  [45]  are used to eliminate background noise which can degrade speech signal quality. Normalisation adjusts amplitude and dynamic range to maintain consistency across recordings  [46] . Speech segmentation techniques, such as endpoint detection  [47]  and silence removal  [48] , isolate speech segments within continuous audio streams, enabling more targeted analysis.\n\nFeature extraction captures the salient characteristics of speech, using Mel-Frequency Cepstral Coefficients (MFCCs)  [49] , which represent spectral properties in a compact form, and Linear Predictive Coding (LPC)  [50] , which models the spectral envelope. Other methods like pitch estimation  [51]  and anti-aliasing filtering  [52]  help preserve signal integrity. Techniques such as de-reverberation  [53]  and pre-emphasis  [54]  further refine the signal quality. For segmentation, windowing techniques like frame blocking divide speech signals into shorter frames, facilitating computational efficiency  [55] . Mean and variance normalisation standardises feature scales, improving model robustness to variability in input data  [56] .",

      "text": "Text preprocessing begins with tokenisation, which breaks down text into smaller units, such as words or characters. This is followed by lowercasing, which standardises the text by treating uppercase and lowercase versions of words identically, thereby reducing vocabulary size and simplifying the learning process  [57] . Punctuation and special character removal further eliminate noise which could interfere with learning. Stopwords-such as \"and\" or \"the\"-are often removed, as they carry little semantic value  [58] . Stemming and lemmatisation techniques group words with similar meanings, helping models understand linguistic variations  [59, 60] .\n\nNumerical values are encoded or replaced with placeholders to maintain the semantic integrity of the text  [61] . Outof-vocabulary words are managed through tokenisation or character-level representations  [62] , while padding and truncation ensure uniform sequence lengths, which is crucial for text classification  [63] . Pretrained word embeddings, such as Word2Vec  [64] , can be used to initialise the embedding layers of deep learning models or be fine-tuned during training. Encoding methods like one-hot or integer encoding convert textual data into numerical representations, while pretrained tokenisers accelerate this conversion  [65] . Text augmentation techniques, such as synonym replacement and paraphrasing, diversify training data and reduce overfitting, improving generalisation  [66] .\n\n3 Datasets for Face, Text, and Speech ER and EG Systems High-quality, diverse datasets are essential for training emotion recognition and generation models. These datasets provide labelled examples from facial expressions, speech, and text, enabling models to learn emotional cues in varied contexts. Some datasets are captured in controlled environments, while others are collected in the wild, offering more complex real-world variations. This section highlights the most widely used datasets across facial, speech, and text systems, focusing on those with comprehensive emotional labelling and diversity (see 1). This section will discuss deep learning methodologies for emotion recognition for faces, speech, and text. We will discuss the strengths and limitations of current literature. Most emotion recognition systems use the 8 primary emotions anger, disgust, fear, happiness, sadness, surprise, contempt, and neutral  [5] . Unlike traditional methodologies where feature extraction and classification are treated as distinct stages  [67] , deep learning frameworks for emotion detection enable end-to-end pipelines. A key component in classification is the use of a loss layer, which regulates the backpropagation error, for estimating prediction probabilities for each sample. For example, in CNNs the softmax loss function is typically used to minimise the difference between the predicted class probabilities and the ground-truth. Some models simultaneously predict both discrete emotions and continuous affect dimensions, such as arousal, valence, and strength of emotion  [23]  (see Fig.  1 ). This aims to minimise data mislabelling and improve overall prediction accuracy.\n\nFigure  1 : The EmoFAN pipeline integrates facial landmark detection, discrete emotion classification, and continuous valence-arousal estimation in a single neural network. This unified model performs all tasks in one pass, using a face-alignment network and an attention mechanism to focus on key facial regions, enhancing accuracy. Joint prediction of both emotion types, combined with knowledge distillation, improves robustness.  [23]  4",

      "text": "FER systems begin with facial feature detection, whereby the face is identified and isolated. Methods such as the Viola-Jones algorithm, Histogram of Oriented Gradients (HOG), and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) are used. Facial landmark detection identifies key points on the face, then feature extraction focuses on geometric features and appearance features. Traditional machine learning algorithms and deep learning models, especially CNNs, classify these features into emotional categories. CNNs are effective as they automatically learn and extract hierarchical features from raw pixel data  [68] . The following section will discuss state-of-the-art research in FER with an emphasis on novelty, recurring themes, strengths, and limitations of current research.\n\nFER systems are classified into two categories: static image and dynamic sequence. While static methods encode spatial information from individual images, dynamic techniques use temporal relationships across frames within sequences  [17] . Historically, FER heavily relied on handcrafted features or shallow learning techniques such as Decision Trees  [69] , K-Nearest Neighbors (K-NN)  [70] , and Support Vector Machines (SVM)  [71] . However, with the rise in emotion detection competitions such as FER2013  [72] , EMOCA  [73] , and ABAW 2023  [74]  a shift towards the use of deep learning techniques occurred. This has coincided with improvements in processing capabilities and network architectures, enabling the widespread adoption of deep learning methodologies.\n\nModels using pretrained Contrastive Language-Image Pretrained (CLIP)  [75]  achieve remarkable results in FER. Using the joint embedding space of text and images, CLIP models can understand contextual information across modalities.\n\nBy training on large datasets containing images paired with descriptions of emotions, CLIP learns to associate visual patterns with their emotional description. One such model which uses CLIP is DFER-CLIP  [76] . This method combines both modalities, using a temporal model atop the CLIP image encoder. Temporal facial features are captured while using descriptions of facial behaviour instead of class names for the text encoder. It uses learnable prompts as context for descriptors of each facial expression class, enabling automatic learning of relevant context information during training. The model's pipeline involves extracting features from facial images or frames, and predicting facial expression descriptions. Furthermore, DFER-CLIP automates the generation of textual descriptors by prompting a language model with queries about useful visual features for each expression, culminating in comprehensive descriptions for classification.\n\nAttention is a key topic in FER with approaches such as self-attention, patch attention, and cross attention being utilised. EmoFan (see Fig.  1 ) uses attention mechanisms on facial landmarks and facial heat maps and achieves SOTA results.\n\n[77] uses patch attention and a pretrained ResNet-18 to extract the facial feature maps to overcome issues caused by occlusion for improved performance.  [78]  uses a similar approach by making use of window-based cross-attention mechanisms in conjunction with landmark detection, and multi-scale feature extraction. In comparison,  [79]  uses self-attention and a transformer to identify facial expressions in images or videos where the face is difficult to see.  [73]  addresses a shortfall in labelled datasets by incorporating an emotion recognition model into the 3D face reconstruction framework DECA  [80]  This enables improved emotion reconstruction and classification, along with the use of their Emotion Consistency Loss.",

      "text": "Figure  2 : The SER model processes frame-level speech features as input, using a 2-layer LSTM to generate outputs aligned with each frame's corresponding time. The LSTM's internal forget gate has been replaced by an attention gate. To differentiate emotional nuances across time and feature dimensions, the model applies a weighting operation separately on the LSTM's output along both the time and feature dimensions. These two weighted outputs are then fed into fully connected layers, and the final output from the softmax layer provides the classification result.  [81]  Recognising emotions in speech involves a multidisciplinary approach, integrating linguistics, psychology, and computer science  [82] . Acoustic feature analysis, focusing on prosody and voice quality, plays a key role. Prosodic features, such as pitch, intensity, and speech rate, effectively indicate emotions. For example, happiness or excitement use higher pitch and greater variability, while sad voices use lower pitch and slower speech. Voice quality, including elements such as breathiness and tension, can also signal different emotions. Word choices and sentence structures, provide additional clues. Short, abrupt sentences can indicate anger, while longer, complex sentences might suggest calmness. Contextual analysis, considering the situational context and dialog history, is vital, as the same utterance can convey different emotions depending on the context  [83] .\n\nTransformer based model ESCM  [84] , achieved state-of-the-art results in SER by adjusting emotions and semantics based on context. They achieve this by using Graph Convolutional Network (GCN) to find correlations between words in spoken coversations. In contrast,  [81]  (see Fig.  2 ) introduces a novel approach to speech emotion recognition by integrating attention mechanisms into Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) models. By prioritising relevant information across both time and feature dimensions, the attention-based LSTM architecture improves performance in SER. The use of frame-level features provide a comprehensive representation of emotional content, contributing to the model's accuracy.  [79]  use Large Language Models (LLMs) and weakly-supervised learning to label the emotions in speech data, which contributes to the effectiveness of their SER model.\n\nFurther innovations in time-frequency analysis have also improved SER. For instance, the fast Continuous Wavelet Transform (fCWT) enables high-resolution analysis of non-stationary speech signals, balancing temporal and spectral features. When combined with Deep Convolutional Neural Networks (DCNNs), this approach enhances the extraction of paralinguistic information, offering robust real-time performance while overcoming limitations of traditional methods like the Short-Term Fourier Transform (STFT)  [85] .",

NLP models enable machines to understand, interpret, and generate text  [87] . Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT)  [88]  are used in most modern NLP models  [89] . These models are useful for TER due to their ability to capture contextual data and decipher emotions in text, enabling SOTA performance. Campagnano et al.  [90]  combines BERT encodings with bidirectional LSTM layers to achieve robust emotion classification, particularly in semantic role labelling tasks.  [91]  use a modified BERT-based architecture to classify emotions for individual sentences and entire texts.  [92]  use a BERT model trained on data from 100 languages as well as X (formerly Twitter), to detect emotions on social media platforms.

The use of CNN-LSTM channels extracts both local and global contextual information from input text, working for diverse text inputs.

      "text": "FEG and face manipulation techniques have been around for years, present on mobile phone apps such as Instagram  [100] , SnapChat [101], and AI photo editors such as FaceApp  [102]  and others. The release of visually appealing talking-head models such as VASA  [103]  and EMO-Live  [99] , have further bolstered public interest in this research area. Talking-head animation refers to models which take as input an image of a person, and generates new frames using audio  [99]  (see Fig.  4 ), video  [104] , or text  [22]  to guide the facial expressions. The manipulation of facial expressions through prompts is another new area of research  [105, 106, 107] . FEG models often focus on prioritising the manipulation of the mouth, eyes, or poses  [108, 109, 110, 111] , while others focus on overall realism  [99, 103, 112] .\n\nWith mouth movements now achieving realism pretrained SOTA models such as Wav2Lip  [109]  are incorporated into larger models to guide the lip movements, while the model focuses on poses and facial expressions  [112] .  [99, 104]  use 3D face modelling techniques and reconstruction methods to capture detailed facial geometry. This allows for accurate expression synthesis and emotion manipulation. Similarly, other methods use 3D registration and mesh-based representations to achieve realistic Face Expression generation  [113, 114] . Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN) are used for generating animations  [105, 115]  due to their ability to create realistic synthetic content. GANs are trained by generating content through a generator network, then using a discriminator network to predict if the generated content is real or not. For Face Expression generation, GANs are combined with other models to generate realistic facial expressions in talking-head animation generation  [116, 117, 118, 106, 113] . For example,  [106]  employ LSTM networks and a GAN for speech-driven animation.\n\n[116] use a GAN to guide the generation process of emotional animations, and preserve the identity of the target face.  [117]  focuses on facial expression manipulation using a modified U-Net structure with GANs and achieves precise emotion manipulation.  [119]  use GANs and attention mechanisms as the backbone of their text to talking-head generation framework. Meanwhile,  [120]  and  [105]  utilise GANs in their methodologies for efficient emotional manipulation. Additionally,  [113]  use a GAN for personalised facial expression manipulation.  [99]  use Diffusion models for generative power and extensive control over the generation of animations. Diffusion models iteratively refine a noisy image into a high-quality sample. This refinement allows for the generation of highly realistic facial expressions, while maintaining control over intensity, duration, and subtle movements. By conditioning the diffusion process on desired expression labels or latent codes, these models produce specific facial expressions with remarkable realism. As diffusion models capture uncertainty during generation, this enables the synthesis of realistic variations.\n\nAttention's ability to focus on important facial regions and generate realistic facial expressions has enabled them to become a key part of face generation architectures. In  [107] , attention mechanisms ensure the generated facial animations accurately capture the speaker's gestures and facial expressions.  [99]  (see Fig.  4 ) integrates attention mechanisms into the pipeline to improve the quality and synchronisation of talking portrait videos, attention mechanisms are utilised to refine motion dynamics and speed adjustments. This method achieves realistic talking portrait videos which closely align with the input audio content.  [119]  use attention gate and self-attention mechanisms in their text-based talking-head generation framework. By incorporating these mechanisms their model manipulates Action Unit-related embeddings, leading for accurate and expressive facial animations synchronised with input text. CLIP with its multimodal capabilities is useful for facial animation generation tasks. By inputting textual prompts to describing desired emotional states along with images associated with those emotions, CLIP can generate images reflecting the specified emotions. This allows the model to learn associations between text and images which improves its ability to generate content with realistic emotions. TalkCLIP by  [121]  generates realistic talking head videos of a target speaker with specific speaking styles. Their model utilises CLIP embeddings and an adaptor network to map text descriptions, to speaking style codes.\n\nFurthermore, researchers have explored the ability to control the generation of emotions on the faces through various inputs such as speech, video, facial reenactment, and text. Speech data is the most common input medium whereby an animated face video is generated using the emotions in the speech  [106, 105, 99]  (see Fig.  4 ). Video is used as an input in architectures where the face is changed to a target face using facial reenactment methods  [104] , or the emotions are manipulated via facial reenactment from a static image  [116] . However, the synchronisation of speech and facial animations rely on robust phoneme processing within the architectures  [119] . Using text as a input is a relatively unexplored field which enables the generation of Face Expression generation based on the emotion content of textual dialogue  [114] . Other researchers have explored methods to directly control the emotions on the output videos using CLIP text prompts  [105, 121] .",

      "text": "One element of SEG, known as voice conversion, speech-to-speech synthesis, or speech reenactment, involves the transformation of speech signals to modify the vocal characteristics of one speaker to resemble another or to produce entirely synthetic voices. These methods form the basis of SEG, whereby the emotions in a target voice can be changed through prompts  [122] (see Fig.  5 ), or by the emotions in a target voice through using a emotional reference voice  [123] .\n\nRecent advancements in AI have led to the development of synthetic voices that are almost indistinguishable from human speech. Achieving realism in generated speech involves capturing natural intonation, rhythm, and emotion. Advanced systems, such as those by ElevenLabs  [124] , use SOTA deep learning techniques to produce high-quality, realistic speech. These systems generate voices that sound authentic and carry unique characteristics associated with individual speakers. This section reviews recent advancements in SEG methodologies. Efficient fine-tuning is achieved using methods such as QLoRA, which significantly reduce computational requirements.\n\nThe model is iteratively optimised and evaluated to attain state-of-the-art performance across various applications.  [29]  SEG models use phonetic content, including emotional cues, from a source voice to synthesize audio in a target voice while retaining desired stylistic characteristics  [123] . A common approach in SEG involves using language models like BERT  [88]  for extracting contextualized representations of linguistic content, thereby enabling precise alignment between source and target voices. BERT embeddings contribute to the controllability and realism of SEG systems, facilitating accurate transformations in speech style and characteristics, which allows synthetic speech to be tailored to specific emotions  [125, 123, 126, 127] . Traditional approaches often rely on text-based conditioning using transcripts  [128] ; however, recent methods, such as that by  [127] , employ discrete representations for phonetic content. This enables the capture of non-textual cues, such as laughter, and supports diverse linguistic applications. Additionally,  [126]  propose an architecture that integrates source and target encoders with a decoder, preserving critical linguistic and speaker features throughout the conversion process to ensure the synthesized speech remains natural and true to the source. SEG also benefits from adversarial training techniques inspired by GANs  [129] . In these frameworks, a discriminator differentiates between target voice samples and synthesized speech, prompting the model to generate speech that convincingly reconstructs the source content while mimicking the target speaker's characteristics.The DDDM-VC model  [130]  introduces a novel approach for SEG, enhancing controllability by decoupling and independently processing attributes such as content, pitch, and timbre. Through attribute-specific denoising, DDDM-VC achieves high-precision voice style transformations, while the inclusion of prior mixup techniques strengthens robustness in voice adaptation, especially in zero-shot scenarios. This disentangled structure enables DDDM-VC to maintain speaker fidelity and naturalness in synthesized voices across a variety of speaker styles . Similarly, PromptVC by  [122]  (see Fig.  5 ), uses a latent diffusion model for voice style conversion using natural language prompts. This enables precise control over the attributes in the generated speech. Another method uses Contrastive Predictive Coding (CPC) features to enhance the quality of synthesised speech  [123] , which is a self-supervised learning technique for predicting future utterances in latent space. Similarly,  [131]  preserves time-synchronisation and fundamental frequency information to maintain the naturalness of converted speech. Finally, two-stage training schemes are frequently used to align hidden representations between source and target speech. The initial stage focuses on reconstructing single utterances to establish alignment, followed by a second stage where multiple utterances refine the conversion process  [132] . This progressive refinement enhances the model's adaptability, improving performance in scenarios with significant divergence between source and target speech characteristics.",

      "text": "TSG models work from a user interface by taking input text, and generating a response (see Fig.  6 ). TSG have the ability to alter the emotional content in existing text. Large Language Models (LLMs) such as ChatGPT  [28] , Llama  [29]  (see Fig.  6 ), Gemini  [133]  can create text with emotions and personality which can pass for human writing. Ensuring accurate grammar and syntax, a diverse and contextually appropriate vocabulary, and consistency in style, tone, and information are all important for TSG. Additionally, typographical errors, realistic mistakes, smooth transitions between ideas and a deep understanding of context also contribute to the text's realism.\n\nUntil recently Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs)  [134]  were used extensively in text generation due to their ability to handle sequential data by maintaining an internal memory. However, traditional RNNs suffer from the vanishing gradient problem, which impedes long-range dependencies. They also struggled to work on long sentences  [135] .\n\nResearchers attempted to combat this by running the RNNs both forward and backward over the textual data  [136] , which did not rectify the problem. These limitations led to the development of Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks, a variant of RNNs. LSTMs employ architectures with gated mechanisms, including input, output, and forget gates, enabling them to learn and retain long-term dependencies in sequential data  [135] . This feature makes LSTMs particularly ideal for tasks requiring memory over extended sequences, such as text generation. Another architecture used for text generation are Sequence-to-Sequence (Seq2Seq) models  [137] , which consist of an encoder and a decoder. Seq2Seq models have shown proficiency in generating coherent and contextually relevant text, making them valuable for emotional text generation tasks. Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs)  [138] , used mostly in computer vision, have also emerged as useful for text generation tasks. The generator produces synthetic text data, while the discriminator evaluates the authenticity of the generated text. Used in conjunction with the above algorithms, attention mechanisms enable models to focus on relevant parts of the input text sequence when generating a response. Attention mechanisms allow models to weigh the importance of each word in the input sequence dynamically as they generate each word in the output sequence  [139] . For example, in the Seq2Seq model, attention mechanisms help align the encoder hidden states with the decoder hidden states at each time point, ensuring the model attends to the most relevant parts of the input sequence when generating each word in the output sequence  [139] .\n\nTo address these challenges researchers are exploring various approaches. One approach involves fine-tuning pretrained language models such as ChatGPT  [28]  for emotion-specific tasks  [140] . This approach uses datasets annotated with emotional labels to train the model to associate linguistic patterns with emotional states. During fine-tuning, adjustments are made to the model's parameters through additional training iterations on emotional text datasets. Developing models with an understanding of contextual cues is essential for accurate emotional text generation. This involves considering factors such as the broader narrative, speaker intent, and audience context to generate realistic text.",

Enhanced latent representations capture intricate facial expressions, incorporating identity-specific canonical keypoints, rotation, translation, and expression deformation components. The transformer model predicts synchronised expression deformations from audio inputs and predicts head pose features, and latent source image representations. Next, three primary modules-Deep Emotional Prompts, Emotional Deformation Network (EDN), and Emotional Adaptation Module (EAM)-play integral roles in the emotional adaptation. Deep Emotional Prompts inject emotion-guided expression generation into the model, using latent codes sampled from a Gaussian distribution to provide crucial emotional guidance.

The inherent complexity of emotions-often difficult for humans to interpret reliably-creates challenges for machines, especially in speech and text ER and EG, where non-verbal cues are absent. Subtle expressions of emotions, such as microexpressions, in FEG add further complexity to emotion recognition and generation processes. A promising direction is to integrate multiple modalities, such as facial cues, speech, text, and body language, to create more robust systems.\n\nAdvancements in natural language processing (NLP), particularly through transformer models like GPT and BERT, are also essential for capturing linguistic nuances and cultural differences in emotional expression. Generating subtle and dynamic emotions in real time is another challenge, especially for interactive applications like virtual reality. Improved real-time emotion tracking is essential to make ER and EG systems more responsive and functional in dynamic environments.\n\nA shortage of large, diverse datasets limits progress in ER and EG. Current datasets often contain biases or labelling errors and lack generalisability, which hampers model performance. Efforts to collect \"in-the-wild\" datasets that reflect real-world emotional dynamics and include multiple languages would improve model effectiveness and fairness. Standardised evaluation metrics are also needed to enable consistent assessment and comparison of models. Openaccess benchmarks would provide clear standards for evaluating models, measuring both accuracy and emotional appropriateness, and fostering progress across the field. Ethical concerns, such as the misuse of deepfake technology, indicate the need for ethical guidelines and detection mechanisms without hindering technological progress.

In FEG, accurately capturing the nuances of facial muscle movements and micro-expressions presents substantial difficulty, while ensuring emotional coherence across frames adds further complexity. Similarly, generating realistic emotions in speech and text requires addressing the intricate subtleties of tone, intonation, context, and emotional consistency. Limited labelled data, especially for in-the-wild systems, also impedes model robustness and generalizability. Future research should focus on expanding dataset diversity and improving models for under-explored modalities like speech and text. Multimodal approaches, enabling emotion analysis and generation across faces, speech, and text, hold promise.
