However, most FER databases are annotated with several basic mutually exclusive emotional categories and contain only one modality, e.g., videos. The monotonous labels and modality cannot accurately imitate human emotions and fulfill applications in the real world. In this paper, we propose MAFW, a large-scale multi-modal compound affective database with 10,045 video-audio clips in the wild. Each clip is annotated with a compound emotional category and a couple of sentences that describe the subjects' affective behaviors in the clip. For the compound emotion annotation, each clip is categorized into one or more of the 11 widely-used emotions, i.e., anger, disgust, fear, happiness, neutral, sadness, surprise, contempt, anxiety, helplessness, and disappointment. To ensure high quality of the labels, we filter out the unreliable annotations by an Expectation Maximization (EM) algorithm, and then obtain 11 single-label emotion categories and 32 multi-label emotion categories. To the best of our knowledge, MAFW is the first in-the-wild multi-modal database annotated with compound emotion annotations and emotionrelated captions.

Ekman  [13]  and contain only a single modality, e.g., videos.

In order to enhance the real-world use of FER technology, it is essential to construct a sizable, in-the-wild dynamic affective database encompassing compound emotions and modalities.\n\nExisting dynamic databases are classified into two categories based on the method of collection: laboratory-collected constrained databases and in-the-wild databases  [24] . Table  1  reports existing dynamic FER databases and their information. Through event induction, the constrained databases, including CK+  [28] , MMI  [31] , etc., record films of facial expression changes in the lab. These databases with single, limited, and consistent expression changes have seen substantial breakthroughs in FER technology, but they fall short in simulating the complex real-world human emotions. The in-the-wild databases, such as AFEW 7.0  [7]  and DFEW  [20] , are constructed by crawling videos from movies and TV dramas. These databases closely reflect actual life, including a variety of contextual factors and spontaneous expressions. However, they still have the following limitations:\n\n• The labels of the data are monotonous. As shown in Table  1 , most existing databases are composed of seven or eight basic mutually exclusive emotional categories, e.g., six basic expressions plus neutral or contempt. Many studies  [10, 12, 32, 35, 40]  have shown that people usually express multiple emotions simultaneously in real life, along with gestures and vocal changes. • Video sources are relatively homogeneous and repetitive. As shown in Table  1 , videos in CAER  [22]  and DFEW  [20]  are from 79 TV dramas and 1,500 movies, respectively, while EmoVoxCeleb  [1]  is collected from interview programs. • The modality of the data is relatively monotonous. As shown in Table  1 , most existing FER databases contain only video and audio modalities, and very few contain text modalities.\n\nTo overcome the above problems, we construct a large-scale compound affective database called MAFW with multiple modalities in the wild, which contains 10,045 video-audio clips. MAFW can be used as a new benchmark for researchers to develop and evaluate their methods for several FER tasks, such as multi-modal emotion recognition, cross-domain FER, emotion captioning, selfsupervision FER, etc. Fig.  1  gives typical examples and the corresponding annotations in our MAFW database. Our MAFW has the following three advantages over the existing databases:\n\n• Our MAFW is the first large-scale, multi-modal, multi-label affective database with 11 single expression categories, 32 multiple expression categories, and emotional descriptive texts. To obtain reliable and objective annotation, each clip in MAFW is independently labeled enough often as one or more of the 11 expression categories. Unreliable labels are then removed by an Expectation Maximization (EM) based reliability evaluation algorithm. • Unlike most existing multi-modal FER databases that are only labeled with expression category tags, we also provide bilingual descriptive texts on facial expressions and emotions for videos in English and Chinese. The descriptive texts include the information on the environment, body movements, facial unit action, and other emotional elements that can be used for both video emotion captioning and FER. • Compared to existing databases whose sources are mostly movies and TV shows, MAFW also includes short videos of reality TV, talk shows, news, variety shows, etc.\n\nIn addition to MAFW, we also propose a novel Transformerbased expression snippet feature learning method (T-ESFL) to effectively model subtle intra-snippet and inter-snippet expression movements for discovering movement-sensitive emotion representation, thus obtaining robust uni-and multi-modal FER. Furthermore, we establish four benchmark evaluation protocols for MAFW. Extensive experiments show the advantages of T-ESFL over other state-of-the-art deep learning methods, for both uni-and multimodal FER.",

      "text": "Constrained dynamic FER databases The constrained databases are usually captured from a small group of individuals in a fixed indoor setting, with emotion frequently occurring during video viewing and event elicitation. For example, CK+  [28]  collected six basic expressions from 123 individuals under laboratory conditions. BP4D  [39]  collected eight expressions from 41 individuals in eight different scenarios, including one-to-one interviews (evoking pleasure), suddenly hearing a voice (evoking surprise), and so on. Despite being spontaneous, the constrained expression databases are limited by a single environment, simple settings, the number of individuals, and the cost of production, making it difficult to simulate the real-world human emotions.\n\nIn-the-wild dynamic FER databases Dynamic FER databases in the wild are usually collected from online sources like TV episodes, movies, and other media. AFEW 7.0  [7]  and DFEW  [20]  collect 1,800 and 16,372 facial expression video clips from movies, respectively.  13,201 facial expression video clips from TV dramas are included in CAER  [22] . Although these databases are created using real-world films, they all have the same restrictions, such as just offering basic and single expression labels and using movie or television clips as their sources.\n\nCompound FER databases Recent studies in psychology and cognition have revealed that people frequently express compound emotions at once  [12, 35] . This suggests that the existing FER databases with single, basic expression labels are not conducive to understand human emotions. In CVPR2017, Deng et al.  [25]  presented the first static compound FER database, namely RAF-DB, that contains 7-class single expressions and 12-class multiple expressions. In ACL2018, Zadeh et al.  [2]  presented a dynamic database, CMU-MOSEI, supporting multiple labels consisting of six basic expressions. Compared to these compound FER databases, our MAFW has more basic emotion categories, reliable multi-label emotion categories, and richer modalities.",

The first data sources are movies, TV dramas, and short videos from some reality shows, talk shows, news, variety shows, etc., on BiliBili and Youtube websites. We develop a crawler program to crawl over 1,600 HD movies, TV dramas, and over 20,000 short videos. These videos come from China, Japan, Korea, Europe, America, and India and cover various themes, e.g., variety, family, science fiction, suspense, love, comedy, and interviews, encompassing a wide range of human emotions. To ensure the diversity of the data, we only randomly download one episode of the same TV series, as well as select no more than three facial expression clips in an episode or short video. The second data source, inspired by  [38] , uses videos from already-existing public databases to supplement some unusual categories, including 1,097 videos from DFEW  [20] , 98 videos from AFEW 7.0  [7] , and 850 videos from EmoVoxCeleb  [1] .\n\nWith the crawled audio-video clips, we first use FaceDetector  [18, 23]  to detect the clips containing faces, then manually remove the unqualified clips to obtain 10,045 usable clips.",

      "text": "Unlike other databases that only give the basic and single emotion annotation, our database offers three different types of emotion annotations for video clips: (1) single expression label, i.e., each clip is assigned to a predominant and exclusive expression label, namely anger(AN), disgust(DI), fear(FE), happiness(HA), sadness(SA), surprise(SU), contempt(CO), anxiety(AX), helplessness(HL), disappointment(DS), and neutral(NE) (see Fig.  1(a) ); (2) multiple expression label, i.e., a clip can be annotated as a multi-label multiple expression category when it is determined to contain multiple emotions (such as \"Anger+Disgust\" in Fig.  1(b )); (3) emotional descriptive text, i.e., each clip is bilingually annotated with a couple of sentences describing the subjects' affective behaviors in the clip. The following details the annotator selection, compound emotion category annotation, and descriptive text annotation, respectively.\n\nAnnotator selection Our annotators are college students from different degrees, majors, countries, and genders. To help annotate the emotion category and emotional descriptive text of each video, each annotator is initially trained to recognize expressions using the expression training tool mett 1 proposed by Paul Ekman to gain knowledge of facial action units and emotions. Following the instruction, the experts evaluate each annotator. Finally, for the annotation, 11 skilled annotators are used, each of whom had a test accuracy of at least 90%. Compound emotion category annotation To facilitate effective annotation, we create the ExpreLabelTool labeling tool. Each clip is categorized into one or more of the 11 complex emotions using the tool and is labeled by the 11 annotators. On a scale of 0 to 1, the annotators evaluate the self-confidence scores of their annotations (including 11 levels in ExpreLabelTool). The more certain the annotation is, the higher the score. After that, each clip can be obtained as an 11-dimensional vector, where each dimension represents the score of the labeled emotion. We describe later how to select single and multiple expressions based on this vector.\n\nDescriptive text annotation For each video, except for the neutral emotion, the annotators are required to watch the video carefully and write down the bilingual emotional description according to the pre-established rules. Fig.  1  shows examples of the descriptive texts for emotion captioning in MAFW. The atmosphere, body movements, facial action units, and other emotional details are included in the captions. To ensure the complementarity of the emotional descriptive text, the descriptive text cannot directly use terms with emotional labels, such as \"she is angry\".",

      "text": "Due to the subjectivity difference of annotators, annotation reliability may be highly variable and inconsistent. To get rid of the labels with lower reliability, motivated by  [34]  and  [5] , we employ an Expectation Maximization (EM) algorithm to assess each annotator's reliability to achieve high-reliability labels. The algorithm of EM for reliability estimation is shown in Algorithm 1.\n\nGiven the labels of 𝑁 videos annotated by 𝑀 annotators, we first binarize their labels into a zero-one matrix 𝐻 𝑘 𝑀𝑁 on the emotion category 𝑘 as:\n\nwhere ℎ 𝑘 𝑖 𝑗 will be \"1\", if the 𝑖th annotator labels the 𝑗th video with emotion category 𝑘, otherwise it will be \"0\".\n\nOur goal is to estimate each annotator' reliability by optimizing the likelihood of their labels. The reliability is formulated as two M-dimensional probability vectors: {𝛼 𝑘 𝑖 } and {𝛽 𝑘 𝑖 },\n\nwhere 𝛼 𝑘 𝑖 is the reliability probability that the 𝑖th annotator correctly labels the emotion category 𝑘 and 𝛽 𝑘 𝑖 is the reliability probability that the 𝑖th annotator does not label the emotion category 𝑘. Note that 𝛼 𝑘 𝑖 and 𝛽 𝑘 𝑖 are independent of each other. 𝑣 𝑘 𝑗 = {0, 1} denotes whether the 𝑗th video has the label of the emotion category 𝑘. We initialize the 𝑣 𝑘 𝑗 via annotation majority voting. With the above definitions, in the E-step of the EM, the reliability probabilities are used to estimate the posterior probability 𝜑 𝑘 𝑗 that the 𝑗th video correctly is labeled with the emotion category 𝑘:\n\nwhere 𝑝 𝑘 is the expected probability of the emotion category 𝑘 and initialized by 1\n\n𝑣 𝑘 𝑗 . 𝜇 𝑘 𝑗 and 𝜂 𝑘 𝑗 are calculated as:\n\nIn the M-step of the EM, we first update 𝑝 𝑘 as:\n\nThen, we update 𝛼 𝑘 𝑖 and 𝛽 𝑘 𝑖 by Maximum Likelihood Estimation:\n\nFinally, we set 𝑄 (𝑝 𝑘 , 𝛼 𝑘 , 𝛽 𝑘 ) as the convergence objective in EM algorithm as:\n\nWe can further determine whether 𝑄 (𝑝 𝑘 , 𝛼 𝑘 , 𝛽 𝑘 ) converges:\n\nwhere 𝑡 denotes the number of iterations and 𝜀 is the convergence threshold that is set as 0.000001 empirically. If 𝑄 (𝑝 𝑘 , 𝛼 𝑘 , 𝛽 𝑘 ) converges, we can obtain the reliability of all annotators, otherwise return the E-step. With the reliability estimation, for each emotion category, we retain five high-reliability labels at least. We use Cronbach's Alpha  [6]  scores to measure the consistency of the retained labels.

      "section_name": "Expression Snippet Feature Learning With Transformer",
      "text": "In-the-wild FER is a difficult task due to subtle facial expression movements within videos that can be too difficult to be modeled properly by existing methods. In this paper, we propose a novel Transformer-based expression snippet feature learning method (T-ESFL) that can model intra-snippet and inter-snippet expression movements and relations, to obtain movement-sensitive emotion representation. In particular, for intra-snippet modeling, we decompose the modeling of facial movements of the entire video into the modeling of a series of small expression snippets so that enhance the encoding of subtle facial movements of each snippet by gradually attending to more salient information. Meanwhile, for inter-snippet modeling, we introduce a snippet order shuffling and reconstruction learning (SOSR) head and its loss to improve the modeling of subtle motion changes across snippets by training the Transformer to identify shuffled snippet orders. To this end, the T-ESFL consists of three main components, i.e., expression snippet decomposition, Transformer, and SOSR, as illustrated in Fig.  4 . Expression snippet decomposition Formally, given an input FER video clip S, we first decompose the input into a series of small expression snippets S = {𝑆 1 , 𝑆 2 , ......𝑆 𝑛 }, where 𝑆 𝑖 represents the 𝑖-th snippet and 𝑛 is the total number of snippets. All the snippets have the same length, and they follow consecutive orders along time. To model subtle expression changes within each snippet, we employ a pre-trained CNN  [29]  and attention learning to extract snippet features 𝑅 𝑖 from each 𝑆 𝑖 , thus augmenting the Transformer's ability to model intra-snippet expression changes.\n\nTransformer architecture With the snippet features 𝑅 𝑖 , a Transformer is applied here to model the expression movements across snippets and discover a unified emotion feature for FER. We follow the typical Transformer  [37]  and apply a multi-head attention-based encoder-decoder pipeline for the processing. In general, the multihead attention estimates the correlation between a query tensor and a key tensor and then aggregates a value tensor according to correlation results to obtain an attended output.\n\nSOSR learning To make the output representation of the Transformer more sensitive to subtle expression movements, SOSR shuffles the snippet order and makes T-ESFL reconstruct the correct order in a self-supervision learning manner. The order of frames/audio within each snippet is retained. We follow a Jigsaw permutation  [30]  and shuffle the order pure randomly to deconstruct the normal temporal dependency between the snippets. The shuffled snippets are sent to T-ESFL and predicted the permutation type by using a reconstruction loss 𝐿 𝑟𝑒𝑐 . Based on this, we can achieve movementsensitive emotion representation 𝑇 for robust FER.\n\nOptimization Objective The total objective function of T-ESFL includes two joint cross-entropy losses and is expressed as 𝐿 = 𝐿 𝑐𝑙𝑠 + 1 𝑛 • 𝐿 𝑟𝑒𝑐 . The first one 𝐿 𝑐𝑙𝑠 is a FER classification loss, and the second one 𝐿 𝑟𝑒𝑐 is the snippet order reconstruction loss. Note that, 𝑛 is the number of the decomposed snippets.",

Then, after deleting any frames without faces, we used the face-alignment-master program  [3]  to collect face areas and 68 landmarks on all frames. Finally, we performed face alignment using affine transform and matrix rotation in OpenCV.\n\nEvaluation Metrics Consistent with the previous research  [20, 25] , we chose four widely-used validation metrics, i.e., the unweighted average recall (UAR), weighted average recall (WAR), F-score (F1), and Area under the ROC curve (AUC), to evaluate the uni-modal and multi-modal FER tasks, respectively. The UAR is the average accuracy of all expression categories, regardless of the number of samples per class. The WAR is the recognition accuracy of overall expressions, which is related to the number of samples in each category. The F1 is regarded as the weighted harmonic mean value of the accuracy and recall, and here we simply calculate the average of the F1 on all categories. AUC generically refers to the area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve, and here we calculate the average AUC for all categories. We expect the proposed model to gain improvements in UAR, WAR, F1, and AUC metrics.\n\nImplementation Details In this paper, we employed the Py-Torch framework to implement all models. We conducted experiments in the uni-modal and multi-modal FER tasks, while each task contained single and compound expression classification, respectively. The key training parameters involved in the work are presented in Table  4 . All models were trained on NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3090 and GTX1080, with an initial learning rate of 0.0001 provided by the grid search strategy.

Therefore, MAFW is the first affective database that provides three types of emotion annotations, i.e., single expression labels (11 class), multiple expression labels (32 class), and bilingual emotion captions. Moreover, we also propose a novel Transformer-based expression snippet feature learning method to obtain movement-sensitive emotion representation, thus achieving state-of-the-art performance on both uni-modal and multi-modal FER in the wild. In the future, we will continue to maintain the MAFW and hope that the release of this database can encourage more research on dynamic FER under unconstrained conditions, e.g., multi-modal emotion recognition, self-supervision FER, video emotion caption, zero-shot AU detection, etc.\n\nTable  1  shows the distributions of 32-class multiple emotion categories on the multiple expression set, including the clip length and clip amount.",

Each emotional description text is available in both Chinese and English. 2. Use a personal pronoun as the subject of the sentence to refer to the main character in the video, such as \"an old man\", \"a boy\", etc., rather than their names (either the character's name or the actor's name). 3. Use the simple present tense. 4. Try to describe the part of the emotional elements in one sentence and modify the verb with an appropriate adverb to emphasize the sentiment state of the character. This part should be no less than eight words. 5. Use predefined sentences to describe the part of the five facial features without adding new descriptions arbitrarily. 6. Each sentence should be grammatically correct.",

We used three widely-used standard metrics in video captioning to evaluate the generated emotional text descriptions, namely BLEU-4  [7] , METEOR  [1] , and CIDEr  [9] .
