      "text": "PEECH is one of the most natural form of human communication and a key modality through with emotions are expressed. Consequently, speech emotion recognition (SER) has received increasing interest within the speech processing and Human-Computer Interaction research communities  [1] [2] [3] [4] . Within affective computing systems, emotions are typically represented using either categorical labels or dimensional labels  [4] [5] [6] . In the former case, emotions are represented as discrete categories using nominal labels (e.g., happy, sad, angry, etc.)  [4] [5] [6] ; and in the latter case, emotion are described using interval scales along affective dimensions such as arousal (activated vs deactivated) and valence (pleasant vs. unpleasant)  [7] [8] [9] . Additionally, the interval labels can also be used to assign scalar values for arousal and valence at each time step, leading to a continuous time series emotion labels  [10, 11] . Both nominal and interval labelling systems have been extensively utilised and investigated. However, the challenge of low inter-rater agreement, i.e. variability in labels reflecting variations in perception among different annotators, remains  [11, 12] . This in turn introduces ambiguity in the labels used to train SER systems and increases uncertainty in the predictions  [12] .\n\n'distance' between the elements. Additionally, research in psychology has shown that people are better at discriminating among options than they are at assigning definitive values for what they perceived  [13] . Consequently, several recent studies have advocated that ordinal labelling of emotions is better aligned with human perception, evidenced by lower inter-rater variability  [14] [15] [16] [17] [18] .\n\nWhile the idea of using ordinal labels is appealing, their use in affective computing systems is fairly recent and the term has been used to refer to two related but distinct types of labels in the emotion recognition literature. In this manuscript, we introduce the terms absolute ordinal labels (AOL) and relative ordinal labels (ROL) to distinguish between these two types of ordinal labels which describe different aspects of emotions. Typically AOLs are obtained by asking annotators to select an element from a finite ordinal scale (e.g., {low arousal, medium arousal, high arousal})  [19] , whereas ROLs are obtained by asking annotators to rank the segments within a speech segment from the lowest arousal (or valence) to the highest arousal (or valence)  [11] . As illustrated in Fig.  1 (c ), AOLs denoted by different shades of blue take values from an 'ordered class', with each label providing an absolute and easily interpretable indication of the affective dimensions at that time (e.g., low arousal). ROLs, denoted by the position of red dots in (b), indicate the rank of that segment with respect to all others within the utterance. These ranks retain the pairwise order relationship between all pairs of segments as inferred from the interval labels shown in (a). ROLs provide a relative label indicating the affect at each time step with respect to other time steps, encapsulating a notion of how emotion changes but lacking an indication of an absolute level.\n\nBoth AOLs and ROLs are ordinal but are not equivalent and convey complementary information. Consider two speech segments that are only assigned AOLs -both labelled 'low arousal', even if annotators can determine which of the two corresponds to a lower arousal, the labelling scheme does not encode this. On the other hand, if the two segments are assigned ROLs -for instance, 'A corresponds to lower aroused than B', clearly, there is no indication of the absolute level of arousal and this label cannot distinguish between a scenario where A corresponds to low arousal level and B corresponds to a medium arousal level (Clip 1 in Fig.  1 ), and one where A corresponds to medium arousal level and B to a high arousal level (Clip 2 in Fig.  1 ). Current literature in affective computing typically utilises one or another, with both scenarios referred to as 'ordinal labels'  [11, 20] .\n\nIn this paper, we propose a framework that integrates both the absolute and relative ordinal information. We assume that AOLs are more readily interpretable and consequently the predictions of an emotion recognition system should be absolute ordinal quantities. Simultaneously we also recognise that ROLs are better aligned with the types of judgements humans are better at making, and consequently ROL should inform the training and outputs of the emotion prediction system. In the proposed framework, the AOLs are represented as states of a finite state Markov model, with the state transition prob-abilities predicted by a system trained using ROLs. The overall model, which we refer to as the dynamic ordinal Markov model (DOMM), thus incorporates both information about the emotion at a given time (state probabilities) as well as the change in emotion at a given time (state transition probabilities).",

      "text": "Preference learning (PL), a popular framework for retrieval tasks, refers to a set of ordinal regression models that has become an appealing approach in affective computing. It ranks the samples in ascending/descending order of an emotional attribute. Cao et.al  [21]  describe the use of rankers for categorical emotion representation with different rankers trained for each emotion category. For instance, a 'happy' ranker trained to treat sample labelled 'happy' with a higher preference than a sample labelled 'sad'. For ranking along emotional attributes or dimensions such as arousal and valence, RankSVMs (a popular PL framework) have been adopted in a number of studies  [20, [22] [23] [24] [25] . Deep neural network (DNN) based emotional PL algorithms such as RankNet  [20]  and RBF-ListNet  [23]  have also drawn increasing attention within the field.\n\nApart from preference learning methods, ordinal regression tasks have also been framed as binary classification problems, by decomposing the ordinal variables into an ensemble of pairs of classes in a staircase-like manner, leading to the Ordinal Binary Decomposition Approach  [26] . Finally, naïve approaches which involve treating ordinal labels as interval or nominal labels (and ignoring their ordinal nature) have also been investigated. For instance, a conventional regression model can be trained by treating the relative ordinal labels [𝑟 1 , … , 𝑟 𝑁 ] as 𝑁 different interval values [1, 2, … , 𝑛, … , 𝑁] (e.g., assign the rank order as real numerical values, 𝑟 𝑛 = 𝑛 )  [26, 27] . However, as stated in  [26, 28]  the regressor will be more sensitive to the converted values rather than the original rank order, which might degrade the performance of the regression models.",

      "text": "AOLs have been adopted widely in current emotion recognition studies, but they are generally treated as nominal labels and the underlying ordinality is ignored. For instance, in a few different studies  [29] [30] [31] [32] , affect labels in terms of low, medium and high arousal are utilised, but naïve nominal classifiers, such as support vector machine (SVM), are employed  [30] . An alternative approach is the threshold method that assumes a continuous latent variable represents the emotional state, with appropriate thresholds dividing the range of the latent variable into a few ordered ranges corresponding to absolute ordinal labels. The prediction model then learns a mapping function between the input features and the continuous hidden latent variable, which is then converted to an absolute ordinal label. Several modelling methods can be utilised in this approach, such as cumulative link models  [33] , and proportional odds models  [34] .\n\nAmongst truly ordinal prediction systems, the Ordinal Multi-class SVM (OMSVM) which was first proposed by Kim and Ahn  [35]  for credit ratings and has since been widely used in the area of financial and market analysis  [36, 37] , appears to be a very promising candidate. Additionally, a suitable ordinal binary decomposition approach can also be employed to model AOLs. Compared to the naïve approach and threshold methods, the binary decomposition method is more suitable since it can capture ordinal information without defining distances between ordered classes. Deep learning may also be a valid solutions to ordinal binary decomposition, but it can suffer with generalisation, especially for small dataset  [35, 38] .",

      "text": "The This idea is illustrated in Fig.  2 , with the position of the blue circles indicating the AOL with 𝐴 0 , 𝐴 1 , and 𝐴 2 denoting low (L), medium (M) and high (H) arousal states respectively; and the values within the circles denoting the ROL (rank within a set of 100 time steps). The number on each arrow given by Δ shows the change in ROL between two consecutive instances. It is clear that the value of Δ carries information about the dynamics of the AOL, i.e., any change in 𝐴 𝑖 . For example, the chances of erroneously predicting the AOL at time 𝑡 4 as low or medium instead of high would be greatly reduced if the automatic system took into account that over the 𝑡 3→4 transition, ROL change from rank 48 to 87 (i.e., ∆ = 39).\n\nAn overview of the proposed Dynamic Ordinal Markov Model (DOMM) based emotion prediction system is shown in Fig.  3 . It comprises two subsystems which operate in parallel, one to predict AOLs and one to predict ROLs from the input features. The AOL prediction subsystem is designed to estimate state posteriors, 𝑃(𝛽 𝑡 |𝒙 𝑡 ), given the input features, 𝒙 𝑡 , at each time step 𝑡. The possible states of the model, 𝛽, correspond to the finite set of possible AOLs. In all the systems presented in this paper, there are possible states -'low', 'medium' and 'high' for arousal or valence.\n\nThe output of the ROL prediction subsystem is a rank, 𝛼 𝑡 , at each time step 𝑡; from which state transition probabilities, 𝑃(𝛽 𝑡 |𝛽 𝑡-1 , Δ𝛼 𝑡 ) , are inferred based on the rank difference between consecutive time steps, Δ𝛼 𝑡 = 𝛼 𝑡 -𝛼 𝑡-1 as per Bayes theorem:\n\nwhere 𝑃(∆𝛼 𝑡 | 𝛽 𝑡-1 , 𝛽 𝑡 ) represents the probability of rank (ROL) difference ∆𝛼 𝑡 given the state (AOL) at previous time step, 𝛽 𝑡-1 , and the current state, 𝛽 𝑡 ; 𝑃(∆𝛼 𝑡 | 𝛽 𝑡-1 ) denotes the probability of a change in rank (ROL) of ∆𝛼 𝑡 occurring given previous state was 𝛽 𝑡-1 ; and 𝑃(𝛽 𝑡 | 𝛽 𝑡-1 ) denotes the probability of transitioning from state 𝛽 𝑡-1 to state 𝛽 𝑡 . Models for all three probabilities on the righthand side of (1) can be inferred from labelled training data.\n\nTo model 𝑃(∆𝛼 𝑡 | 𝛽 𝑡-1 ), first all instances of ROL pairs [ 𝛼 𝑡 , 𝛼 𝑡-1 ] with initial state 𝛽 𝑡-1 = 𝐿 from the training data are selected and the corresponding set of Δ𝛼 𝑡 values are computed. Kernel density estimation (KDE)  [40, 41]   Models for 𝑃(Δ𝛼 𝑡 |𝛽 𝑡-1 , 𝛽 𝑡 ) can also be obtained by the same approach, by partitioning the dataset into 9 subsets corresponding to all combinations of 𝛽 𝑡-1 , 𝛽 𝑡 ∈ {𝐿, 𝑀, 𝐻} × {𝐿, 𝑀, 𝐻} , following by KDE. An example is illustrated in Fig.  4   Lastly, the probability 𝑃( 𝛽 𝑡 | 𝛽 𝑡-1 ) is calculated as:\n\nwhere, 𝑖, 𝑗 ∈ {𝐿, 𝑀, 𝐻}; 𝑁 𝑖 denotes the number of instances of state (AOL) 𝑖 in the training data set; and 𝑁 𝑖→𝑗 denotes the number of instances of state 𝑖 followed by state 𝑗 in the training set.\n\nTogether, the state posteriors, 𝑃(𝛽 𝑡 |𝒙 𝑡 ), and the state transition probabilities, 𝑃(𝛽 𝑡 |𝛽 𝑡-1 , Δ𝛼 𝑡 ) , describe a 'dynamic' ordinal Markov model (DOMM). Here the term 'ordinal' refers to the fact that the model represents ordinal labels and the term 'dynamic' refers to the fact that both the state posterior probabilities and the state transition probabilities are time-varying, with both dependent on the input features, 𝒙 𝑡 , at time 𝑡. Note that Δ𝛼 𝑡 is estimated from 𝒙 𝑡 by the ROL prediction subsystem and hence the state transition probabilities are also dynamically inferred from the input features. Given a sequence of input features, {𝒙 𝑡 ; 𝑡 1 ≤ 𝑡 ≤ 𝑡 𝑁 }, the DOMM generates a state lattice and the most probable sequence of states (ab-  The projection of points on the vector indicates ranks  [45] .

During the prediction (test) phase, the test data is passing through the SVM classifiers in order, either along the forward or backward direction, until a class is predicted, at which point the remaining SVMs will not be used. To convert the outputs of OMSVM into state posteriors, we fit a sigmoid function to the outputs as suggested in  [50] :\n\nwhere 𝑦 denotes the SVM output; and 𝑎 and 𝑏 refer to sigmoid function parameters which are determined during training as outlined in  [50] .

      "text": "Absolute ordinal labels can be obtained by thresholding the interval labels into three ordinal levels -low, medium, and high. However, choosing these thresholds are a challenge and no commonly agreed upon thresholds exist  [29, 57] . Therefore, a range of potentially suitable thresholds were analysed. Additionally, the conversion is carried out individually for each annotator and the final consensus AOL is inferred via majority vote among the 6 individual AOLs (one per annotator).\n\nGiven the label value 𝑦 ̅ 𝑡 representing the average arousal/valence intensity within each window and thresholds 𝜃 1 and 𝜃 2 , the AOL is taken as Low, if 𝑦 ̅ 𝑡 ≤ 𝜃 1 ; Medium, if 𝜃 1 < 𝑦 ̅ 𝑡 ≤ 𝜃 2 ; and High, if 𝑦 ̅ 𝑡 > 𝜃 2 . To determine suitable values for 𝜃 1 and 𝜃 2 , measures of label balance and inter-rater agreement after conversion are analysed. Interrater agreement represents consensus level among the converted AOL across multiple annotators. It is quantified as the ratio of the number of frames where more than half of the raters agree on the same AOL. A reasonably high ratio means a higher inter-rater agreement.\n\nThere will be a trade-off between the label balance and level of agreement. For instance, thresholding all annotations into a single AOL leads to perfect agreement but also a highly skewed and uninformative label distribution. Whereas, equally spacing the thresholds is likely to lead to less distinguishable labels that are unlikely to be optimal except in the case of uniform distribution of interval labels, at unrealistic expectation -extreme affect labels are less frequent.\n\nFinally, as arousal annotations were observed to be reasonably symmetrically distributed over [-1, 1], the thresholds 𝜃 𝑎1 and 𝜃 𝑎2 for arousal were also set to be symmetric, with 𝜃 𝑎2 = -𝜃 𝑎1 . A range of different values of 𝜃 𝑎2 , within [0.08, 0.2] with a step size 0.02, was analysed. This region was selected based on the observation that the median arousal value from every annotator fell in the range [-0.067, 0.118] and we wanted to ensure that the 'medium' label always covers the median values. Both the label balance measure and the inter-rater agreement for the chosen range of thresholds are shown in Fig.  6(a) .\n\nIt was also observed that valence labels in RECOLA were skewed towards positive values and consequently the two thresholds, 𝜃 𝑣1 and 𝜃 𝑣2 , were assumed to be symmetrical about 0.085 and instead analysed over the range 𝜃 𝑣2 ∈ [0.13, 0.21] with 𝜃 𝑣1 = 0.17 -𝜃 𝑣2 . These ranges were also chosen so as to ensure the median label value from each annotator was covered by the 'medium' label.\n\nThe label balance measure and inter-rater agreement variations across the range of 𝜃 𝑣2 is depicted in Fig.  6(b ). In Fig.  6 , the. x-axis denotes the upper threshold 𝜃 𝑎2 and 𝜃 𝑣2 values, the left y-axis denotes the label balance and right y-axis denotes the inter-rater agreement levels. Label balance is plotted as the average 𝛾 across all annotators (i.e., 𝛾̅ ) and represented by a blue dashed line, and the inter-rater agreement level is indicated by the solid red line.\n\nIt can be seen from Fig.  6 (a) that 𝛾̅ tends to converge to the minima within the range 𝜃 𝑎2 ∈ [0.14, 0.18], suggesting this would lead to the most balanced label distribution. The agreement level within this range is between 0.54 to 0.6 which is relatively high as well. It should also be noted that the higher agreement level outside this range for 𝜃 𝑎2 mostly likely arises from imbalanced labels -i.e., a large number of instances are assigned to one label. Similar finding were observed for valence, and threshold val-  ues ranging around 𝜃 𝑣2 ∈ [0.16, 0.18] were found to be suitable. Finally, a different set of AOLs for different thresholds within the range 𝜃 𝑎2 ∈ [0.12, 0.18] for arousal; and 𝜃 𝑣2 ∈ [0.14, 0.18] for valence with step size 0.01 were inferred and all experiments were repeated using each set and the mean and standard deviation across them are reported in this paper.",

It is a measurement of precision in retrieving top or bottom k% of the samples. It is calculated by first dividing ground truth labels into high and low groups following the rule that ROLs larger than median is collected in the high group and vice versa as shown in top section of Fig.  8 . The prediction is counted as a success if the top 𝑘% of the predictions belong to high group and the bottom 𝑘% samples of the predictions are retrieved from the low group as depicted in Fig.  8 . The other commonly used metric for quantifying mismatch between two ranks is Kendell's Tau  [71] . It ranges from -1 to 1 indicating the range from completely antithesis to perfect matched, with 0 indicating the two ranks are independent  [72] .

Experimental results on the IEMOCAP database are reported in terms of the mean and standard deviation computed across each fold of the 10-fold cross validation as discussed in section 4.

On the IEMOCAP database, the OMSVM system is compared to an HMM based baseline  [29] . While the UAR of the OMSVM system is lower than that of the baseline, it is reasonably high and significantly higher than chance. Consequently, we expect the OMSVM system to constitute a reasonable AOL prediction subsystem to evaluate the proposed framework. Finally, it should be noted that the baseline system results were reported with a different AOL conversion scheme.\n\nNo suitable baseline systems that allow for a direct comparison on the RECOLA database could be identified since most published literature using RECOLA deals with interval label prediction. The closest reported approaches focus on binary classification tasks of Low/High arousal/valence  [31, 32] . Thus, the binary classification  [31]  was adopted as a reference system (refer Table  3 ). The performance of the OMSVM subsystem is lower than that of reference system, but the OMSVM system's target is one of three AOLs while the reference system is solving a twoclass problem.",

On the IEMOCAP dataset, the RankSVM system achieves a P@k of around 95% and 67% for arousal and valence at k=10% which is better than the 85% and 63% reported in  [20] .\n\nAdditionally, recognising that P@k does not reflect the exact ranking order within the samples but only indicates the performance of retrieving top and bottom k% of samples, we also report Kendall's Tau in Table  4 . The performance of the RankSVM system for valence prediction is uniformly poorer than arousal rank prediction and while this is consistent with reported results on interval labels as well when using audio inputs  [54, 73] , the Kendall's Tau value for valence rank prediction in IEMOCAP is close to chance.",

      "text": "The DOMM framework was developed to integrate complementary information from independent AOL and ROL prediction subsystems. Noting that the proposed approach ultimately predicts AOLs, UAR and weighted Cohen's kappa (𝑘 𝑤 ) are employed as performance metrics. Also recall that UAR does not take the ordinal nature of the labels into account, while 𝑘 𝑤 does. The proposed system, denoted as DOMM_RS, is compared to the basic OMSVM system that does not make use of any relative ordinal information. In addition, we also report the per-Fig.  9 . P@k on RECOLA and IEMOCAP at k values: P@10, P@20, P@30, P@40 and P@50.    5 . It can be seen from these results that consistently, across both databases and across both arousal and valence, the DOMM_RS outperforms the OMSVM system and is in turn outperformed by the DOMM_GT system. The consistent trends strongly support the idea that absolute and relative ordinal labels contain complementary information and jointly modelling them has clear benefits. The performance discrepancy between DOMM_RS and DOMM_GT can be reasonably explained by the performance of the RankSVM based ROL prediction subsystem reported in Table  4 . Additionally, it is worth noting that arousal AOLs are somewhat unbalanced for IEMOCAP as can be seen from Table  2 . The relatively lower number of high and low arousal state could have the effect of increasing the transition probability into the medium arousal state and consequently a higher chance of incorrectly predicting medium  [29] . Table  5  also includes the reported performance of the HMM baseline  [29] , however, as previously mentioned this performance was estimated with different AOLs and data partitions.\n\nFinally, in addition to the summary results in Table  5 , we also provide comparisons between the three systems for each individual arousal and valence thresholds (𝜃 𝑎2 and 𝜃 𝑣2 ) employed in our interval label to AOL conversion in Fig.  10  and 11 . The red bar on the boxplots indicates the median values across different thresholds and each dot represents performance measured with each threshold. The dashed lines in the boxplots connect dots corresponding to the same threshold and is provided for ease of comparison of systems at the same threshold. It can be seen that the trends observable in Table  5  and even more evident with the additional detail in these figures and specifically DOMM_GT outperforms DOMM_RS, which in turn outperforms OMSVM across every all measures and when using any of the thresholds for interval to AOL conversion.",

      "text": "In the growing body of literature on ordinal emotion prediction, the term \"ordinal emotion labels\" has been used to refer to two related but different notions. In this paper, we explicitly distinguish between them and introduce the terminology absolute ordinal label (AOL) and relative ordinal label (ROL), conveying the different aspect of ordinality they emobody. Followig this, we establish that the complementary nature of the information encoded in these two different ordinal labelling schemes can be integrated in a joint model of emotion dynamics. Specifically, this novel framework, referred to as the dynamic ordinal Markov model (DOMM), integrates time varying absolute and relative ordinal information.\n\nA realizable and computationally inexpensive, speechbased emotion prediction based on the proposed framework, making use of OMSVM and RankSVM based subsystems for AOL and ROL predictions was implemented to validate the proposed framework. The emotion prediction results obtained across a range of different configurations clearly indicates that integrating relative ordinal information can significantly improve absolute ordinal emotion prediction. The novel system is compared to both, a baseline OMSVM system that only models AOLs; and a version of the novel system that uses oracle ROLs (instead of predicted ROLs) to serve as an indication of the upper bound on the predictive capabilities of the dynamic original Markov model. These experimental comparisons were carried out on both IEMOCAP and RECOLA datasets, and in terms of both UAR and weigthed Kappa. Consistently, in all comparisons, the joint model outperformed AOL only prediction. Finally, the comparison with the version using oracle ROLs suggest that improving the RankSVM based subsystem can lead to further gains in prediction accuracy.",
