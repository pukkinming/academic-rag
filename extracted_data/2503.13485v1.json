      "text": "Deep learning has had a great impact on various fields of computer science by enabling data-driven representation learning in a decade. Because science and technology policy decisions for a nation can be made on the impact of each technology, quantifying research impact is an important task. The number of citations and impact factor can be used to measure the impact for individual research. What would have happened without the research, however, is fundamentally a counterfactual phenomenon. Thus, we propose an approach based on causal inference to quantify the research impact of a specific technical topic. We leverage difference-in-difference to quantify the research impact by applying to bibliometric data. First, we identify papers of a specific technical topic using keywords or category tags from Microsoft Academic Graph, which is one of the largest academic publication dataset. Next, we build a paper citation network between each technical field. Then, we aggregate the crossfield citation count for each research field. Finally, the impact of a specific technical topic for each research field is estimated by applying difference-in-difference. Evaluation results show that deep learning significantly affects computer vision and natural language processing. Besides, deep learning significantly affects cross-field citation especially for speech recognition to computer vision and natural language processing to computer vision. Moreover, our method revealed that the impact of deep learning was 3.1 times of the impact of interpretability for ML models.",

      "text": "Deep learning made a remarkable impact on many scientific disciplines especially in computer science domain such as image recognition and natural language processing  [23] . Deep Learning has been used in various fields since the success of image recognition at the ImageNet Large Scale Visual Recognition Challenge (ILSVRC) in 2012  [21] . As a result, Yoshua Bengio, Geoffrey Hinton, and Yann LeCun received the 2018 ACM A.M. Turing Award for breakthroughs of deep neural networks that revolutionalized in Artificial Intelligence (AI) 1 . Although deep learning made a qualitatively significant impact on AI, a quantitative impact remains unveiled. It is important to quantify the impact of research on a technical topic, not only deep learning, on the research field. Therefore, we aim to consider how to quantify the impact of research on a technical topic.\n\nQuantifying research impact is an important task for a national government and individual researchers. From the perspective of a national government, in national science and technology policy, it is necessary to measure the impact of research because the national government plans its budget and personnel based on the prediction of technological development. From the perspective of individual researchers, it is useful to understand the influence of past research when considering research themes.\n\nA naive method to quantify the research impact is to measure the number of citations of individual research. When measuring the effects of a technical topic, it is possible to aggregate citations by averages. Suppose that a specific technical topic occurred at year 𝑁 (e.g., Deep Learning at 2012), and we would like to quantify its impact. One simple method is to compare the number of papers whose topic is neural network before and after year 𝑁 . However, this method has two problems. First, what would have happened without the research is fundamentally a counterfactual phenomenon (counterfactual problem (P1)). Second, the difference between before and after a specific technical topic occurred could contain several confounding factors not only the effect of the technical topic occurred but also a temporal trend, etc. This is the well-known problem of pre-post study design (pre-post comparison problem (P2))  [7, 13] .\n\nIn this paper, we propose a framework based on causal inference to quantify the research impact of a specific technical topic using a large-scale citation dataset. The key idea of our approach is leveraging difference-in-difference  [22]  to bibliometric data. Figure  1  shows the conceptual overview of the proposed approach. First, we identify papers of a specific technical topic from the research paper dataset using keywords or category tags. The identified papers are referred to as treatment group papers, and the remained papers are referred to as control group papers. We use Microsoft Academic Graph (MAG)  [33, 38, 39]  which is one of the largest academic publication dataset as a research paper dataset. Second, we build a paper citation network using the treatment group papers, the control group papers, and papers cited by both groups of papers. Next, the number of citations related to a specific topic (treatment group) and those not related to a specific topic (control group) is counted for each research field. Finally, the impact of a research topic for each research field is estimated by applying difference-in-difference. Exploiting causal inference can solve the counterfactual problem (P1) and pre-post comparison problem (P2). We validate our framework using several technical topics (e.g., deep learning and interpretability for ML models) for AI top conferences including quantifying the research impact of deep learning, and comparing the research impact of deep learning with other topics. Evaluation results show that (1) deep learning significantly affects computer vision (+42.15% publication) and natural language processing (+35.31% publication), (2) data mining papers cite many papers in various fields, (3) deep learning significantly affect cross-field citation especially for speech recognition to computer vision (+17.4% p.p.), and natural language processing to computer vision (+7.1% p.p.), and (4) the quantified  The rest of this paper is organized as follows. In the next section, we reviews related work on the analysis of bibliometric data. We explain the dataset used in this study in Section 3. Section 4 describes the proposed approach. We evaluate our approach in Section 5. Finally, we conclude this study and discuss future work.",

      "text": "Most basic approach to quantify a research impact is to use citation count, such as total number of citations and average number of citations per publication  [36] . However, it is necessary to calculate the number of citations by considering various factors (e.g., time window and research field) depending on the purpose of comparing studies. In the existing studies, several types of research impacts have been proposed such as long-term impact  [37] , impact of individual  [32]  and impact scores for individual research publications  [35] . In these studies, the situation of what would have happened without the study is not taken into account.\n\nThere are several studies which exploit causal inference for quantifying the research impact. Farys and Wolbring estimated the effect of the Nobel Prize for publication using matched control group  [16] . Bornmann et al. proposed to leverage the propensity score to consider the difference in the number of publications in each field (i.e., field-normalization)  [6] . Since DID is more suitable for the estimation considering the fixed effect than propensity score matching  [18] , we proposed to leverage the DID method.",

As of February 1, 2021, MAG consists of 251,493,799 papers and 53,529 venues. To focus on AI field, we filter the dataset by AI related venues. To select the venues, we follow the work of Shao et al.  [30]  which defines 20 sub-fields of AI such as Classical AI, Machine Learning (ML), Data Mining (DM), Computer Vision (CV), Natural Language Processing (NLP), Speech Recognition (SR) etc. They made these sub-field by interviewing experts in each sub-field. We slightly change the list of venues for each sub-field. For example, COLT (Conference on Learning Theory), which is originally assigned to NLP, is changed  to an AI conference rather than an NLP conference. The complete venue lists of each sub-field are shown in Table  1 .\n\nFigure  2  shows the number of published papers for each research field from 2007 to 2020.

      "text": "Our goal is to quantify the impact of the emergence of a specific technical topic, taking causality into account. The ideal method is to perform a so-called Randomized Controlled Trial (RCT), in which research topics in each paper are randomly assigned and compared the citation count. However, this is impractical, as researchers cannot be forced to write a paper regarding a specific topic. Thus, we adopt quasi-experimental design  [10]  which assesses a causality based purely on the observational data. Specifically, we conduct difference-in-differences (DID)  [22] , commonly used in economics  [14]  and healthcare  [12]  literature. Similar approach is used to quantify the effect of audio streaming consumption (i.e., music vs podcast)  [24] , the effect of online social actions to offline behavior  [3]  and the change of human needs during COVID-19 pandemic using web search logs  [34] . We treat the emergence of a novel specific technical topic as the intervention. Then, papers which are related to a specific technical topic are considered as treatment group, and papers which are not related to a specific technical topic are considered as control group.\n\nTo conduct DID, the proposed framework consists of four steps.\n\n(1) Identifying treatment group papers (paper related to a specific technical topic) from academic paper database. (2) Building a paper citation network using the treatment group papers and papers cited by the treatment group papers (3) Counting intra and inter sub-field citation using the paper citation network.

For example, if we would like to extract papers related to deep learning, the examples of keyword are neural network, deep learning, and long short term memory. In out experiment, we further filter the papers by AI related conferences defined in 3 to focus on AI related topics, and added sub-fields of AI (Classical AI, ML, DM, CV, NLP, SR).

As an alternative method, we can adopt propensity score matching  [24]  to validate the indistinguishable of two groups.

While hand-crafted feature was designed by using domain knowledge in each research field before the rise of deep learning, the realization of representation learning using deep learning is thought to have accelerated research across fields. Therefore, we aim to quantify the impact of deep learning as a technical field in the research of computer science domain. Specifically, we solve the following research questions.\n\n• RQ1: How much did deep learning affect each field of computer science? • RQ2: To what extent does deep learning impact the integration of computer science disciplines?\n\nTo answer these research questions, we used the following setting. To identify the research related to deep learning (which indicates that the paper is regarded as the treatment group), the paper which included the word of the neural network in the field of study was extracted. We set the time of intervention was 2012 because the drastic improvement of image recognition accuracy in ILSVRC 2012 was one of the opportunities of the popularization of deep learning  [21] . Thus, we set 𝑇  (i.e., before and after 5 years). We count the number of paper citation by Eq.(  2 ). We estimated the ATE by Eq.(  4 ) for RQ1, and Eq.(3) for RQ2.\n\n5.1.1 RQ1: How much did deep learning affect each field of computer science? Table  2  shows the result of relative change in the number of publication in each research field for deep learning. Note that when we test the parallel trend for pre-intervention period from 2002 to 2011, most research fields except for Classical AI were not met the parallel trend. Although we need to adjust covariates from this results, we can see that the number of publication regarding deep learning has greatly increased after 2012, especially for computer vision and natural language processing.",

For deep learning, we used the same setting in the previous subsection. To identify the research related to GBDT, the paper which included the word of the gradient boost in the field of study was extracted. Similarly, to identify the research related to interpretability of ML models, the paper which included the word of the interpretability in the field of study was extracted.\n\nWe set the time of intervention for GBDT was 2016 because the paper of XGBoost was published at KDD 2016.

Here, we discuss these results in more depth. Notably, NLP and SR have a relatively high values of the relative change compared to other research field for GBDT.
