      "text": "In its 5th edition, the Multimodal Sentiment Analysis Challenge (MuSe) proposes two tasks, namely audio-visual analysis of perceived characteristics of individuals and cross-cultural humor detection. Each respective sub-challenge employs a distinct dataset.\n\nIn the first sub-challenge, M S P , participants are tasked with training their machine learning models for recognition of perceived characteristics of individuals from video interviews. Audio-visual social perception analysis explores social traits that are important for how we are being perceived by other people  [1] . The perception others have of us can have a significant impact on our relationships with them as well as on our own professional future  [3] . At the same time, social perception is a complex phenomenon for which different theories have been brought forward. The Dual Perspective Model (DPM)  [2]  is based on the dimensions of agency (i. e., traits related to goal-achievement such as competence or dominance) and communality (i. e., traits referring to social relations such as friendliness or warmth)  [11] . The former is stereotypically associated with masculine gender roles, while the latter is traditionally attributed to femininity  [25] . In this context, the work by Eulitz and Gazdag  [27]  underscores the significance of understanding how perceived characteristics, particularly agentic traits, influence professional success, including the performance of CEOs in the stock market. Such insights are invaluable for organizations aiming to thrive in dynamic and competitive environments. However, extracting these insights requires advanced tools capable of capturing and analyzing nuanced social signals. Traditional methods of assessing social perception often rely on structured questionnaires or observational techniques to gauge individuals' interpretations and responses to social cues and interactions. In contrast, audio-visual machine learning systems offer scalability, enabling researchers to analyze large datasets efficiently. Moreover, these systems can uncover patterns and correlations that may not be immediately apparent to human observers, leading to deeper insights into the factors influencing social perception. This is where audio-visual machine learning systems play a pivotal role and can offer a holistic approach to understanding social perception by leveraging both auditory and visual cues. They can capture subtle nuances in facial expressions  [16, 38, 59] , body language  [15] , tone of voice  [59] , and verbal content  [22, 53] , providing a rich set of features to analyze. In the context of the Social Perception Sub-Challenge, the LMU Munich Executive Leadership Perception (LMU-ELP) dataset (cf. Section 2.1) presents a unique opportunity to explore the intersection of audio-visual data and social perception.\n\nIn the second task, Cross-Cultural Humor Detection Sub-Challenge (M S H\n\n), participants will train their models to detect humor within German football press conference recordings.\n\nHumor is a ubiquitous yet puzzling phenomenon in human communication. While it is strongly connected with an intention to amuse one's audience  [31] , humor has been shown to potentially elicit a wide range of both positive and negative effects  [17] . Throughout the last three decades, researchers in Affective Computing and related fields have addressed problems pertaining to computational humor, in particular, automatic humor detection  [54, 60, 68] . Spurred by the advancements in multimodal sentiment analysis, considerable attention has been paid to multimodal approaches to humor detection recently  [13, 35] . Such multimodal methods are particularly promising, as humor in personal interactions is an inherently multimodal phenomenon, expressed not just by means of what is said, but also via, e. g., gestures and facial expressions. A plethora of datasets dedicated to multimodal humor recognition exists  [36, 46, 64] . However, they are typically built from recordings of staged contexts, e. g., TV shows or TED talks, thus potentially missing out on spontaneous, in-the-wild aspects of humorous communication. Furthermore, several such datasets utilize audience laughter as a proxy label for humor, thus taking the risk of reducing the complex concept of humorous communication to the mere delivery of (scripted) punchlines. The P SFCH dataset  [21]  seeks to mitigate these issues by providing videos from a semistaged context, namely press conferences, that have been labeled manually for humor.\n\nM S H adds another layer of complexity to the humor recognition task by introducing a cross-cultural scenario. More specifically, the training data consists of German recordings, while the test data is composed of English videos. Whereas empirical studies have been conducted on cross-cultural similarities and differences in humor  [39, 55] , this problem has not received much attention from the machine learning domain. To the best of our knowledge, last year's edition of M S H was the first to introduce this task to the community, giving rise to a range of different systems proposed by the challenge's participants  [33, 42, 65, 67, 70] . This year's edition of M S H maintains the same data and data partitions as last year's  [20] . The training set comprises recordings from German football press conferences, while the unseen test set exclusively features press conferences conducted in English, thus setting the stage for a cross-cultural, cross-lingual evaluation scenario. For the training partition, we utilize the German Passau Spontaneous Football Coach Humor (P SFCH) (P SFCH) dataset  [21] , previously featured in the 2022 and 2023 editions of MuSe  [19, 33, 40, 65, 66, 70] . For the unseen test partition, we expanded the P SFCH dataset by incorporating press conference recordings delivered by seven distinct coaches from the English Premier League spanning from September 2016 to September 2020. Both the training and test partitions exclusively contain recordings where the respective coach is speaking, contributing to an overall duration exceeding 17 hours. Although the original videos are labeled according to the Humor Style Questionnaire (HSQ) framework introduced by Martin et al.  [44] , the focus in this year's M S H challenge is on binary prediction, specifically detecting the presence or absence of humor.\n\nThe sub-challenges presented in MuSe 2024 are designed to captivate a broad audience, drawing the interest of researchers spanning numerous domains, including multimodal sentiment analysis, affective computing, natural language processing, and signal processing. MuSe 2024 provides participants with an ideal platform to apply their expertise by leveraging multimodal self-supervised and representation learning techniques, as well as harnessing the power of generative AI and Large Language Models (LLMs).\n\nEach sub-challenge is characterized by its unique datasets and prediction objectives, providing participants with an opportunity In Section 2, we provide a comprehensive overview of the outlined sub-challenges, detailing their corresponding datasets and the challenge protocol. Following this, Section 3 elaborates on our pre-processing and feature extraction pipeline, along with the experimental setup utilized to compute baseline results for each subchallenge. Subsequently, the results are showcased in Section 4, leading to the conclusion of the paper in Section 5.",

In our dataset, these CEOs present their firms to potential investors before taking their firms public, i. e., selling shares in the stock market for the first time. The goal of this challenge is to predict the agency and communiality of each individual on a 16-dimensional Likert scale ranging from 1 to 7. The target labels have been selected based on an established measure in social psychology (Bem Sex-Role Inventory scale  [12] ) to assess perceptions of agency and commonality, the basic dimension of the Dual Perspective Model  [2] , including aggressiveness, arrogance, assertiveness, confidence, dominance, independence, leadership qualities, and risk-taking propensity (pertaining to agency), as well as attributes like collaboration, enthusiasm, friendliness, good-naturedness, kindness, likability, sincerity, and warmth (associated with communality). Using Amazon Mechanical Turk (MTurk), 4304 annotators have labeled all dimensions of our data, comprising 177 CEOs. The dataset stands out for its comprehensive coverage of 16 distinguished labels of each individual, offering new perspectives in multimodal sensing of social signals. To the best of our knowledge, LMU-ELP is the first multimodal dataset that provides detailed insights into the nuanced dimensions of gender-associated attributes. M S P participants are encouraged to explore multimodal machine learning methods to automatically recognize CEOs' perceived characteristics. Each team will submit their 16 predictions. The evaluation metric is Pearson's correlation coefficient ( ), and the mean of all 16 values is set as the challenge's evaluation criterion.",

These spectrogram representations are then fed into D N 121. We extract a 1024-dimensional feature vector from the output of the last pooling layer. The effectiveness of D S has been validated across various speech and audio recognition tasks  [5, 7, [48] [49] [50] .\n\n3.2.3 W 2V 2.0 . In recent years, there has been a major interest in self-supervised pretrained Transformer models in computer audition  [43] . An exemplary foundation model is W 2V 2.0  [9] , which has found widespread application in SER tasks  [47, 51] .

Similarly, recent works (e. g.,  [49, 65] ) conducted experiments applying these features, achieving an overall best result when fusing them with other features from the audio and text modality.

Looking only at the audio modality, G MAPS outperforms both evaluated deep features -D S and W 2V 2.0 -at .2561 and .1442. Overall, however, results on development and test partition often diverge substantially, e. g., D S drops from .2075 to .0113. The weighted late fusion approach, which chooses the best model for each target separately, leads to greatly increased correlations on both development ( = .5579) and test set ( = .3573), suggesting that no singular feature works best for every target label.\n\nTo further investigate how the configurations fare at recognizing each of the 16 attributes, we report the best development and accompanying test set results for the individual target attributes in Table  2 . We further make use of the \"Big Two\" dimensions Agency and Communion  [11]  to split the target labels into two groups. From the agentive subgroup, aggressive can be recognized quite well by models trained on any of the evaluated features, with V T FER achieving the best results on both development and test results and further showing solid generalization capabilities. However, for confident, the best strong development performance of V T FER does not transfer to the test set, dropping from .7373 to a mere .0783 Pearson's correlation. In the communal subgroup, goodnatured and kind are detected quite reliably with good generalization behavior from models trained on visual features. Audio models trained on deep features (D S and W 2V 2.0 ), on the other hand, see performance drop to chance level when moving from development to test. . All models achieve above-chance (0.5 AUC) results, regardless of modality and employed feature representations.

GRUs trained on these features reach .7995 (V T FER ) and .8042 (W 2V 2.0 ) on the test partition. However, it can be observed that V T FER features do not generalize as well to unseen data, with performance dropping from .8932 to .7995 between development and test partitions. As last year, these generalization deficits extend across all visual features while the audio modality fares better, with W 2V 2.0 and G MAPS only slightly dropping in AUC and D S matching development performance on the test set.

It uses an extended version of the P SFCH dataset  [21] . Participants are tasked to detect spontaneous humor in press conferences across cultures and languages, training their models on recordings of German-speaking trainers and testing on English data.\n\nWe employed publicly accessible codes and repositories to extract audio, visual, and textual features. Additionally, we trained simple GRU models on the acquired representations to establish the official challenge baselines. These baselines represent the models' performance on the test partitions of each sub-challenge, outlined as follows: a mean value of .3573 for M S P , and an AUC value of .8682 for M S H\n\n. Both baseline results were achieved via late fusion of all modalities in each respective sub-challenge.\n\nBy sharing our code, datasets, and features publicly, we aim to facilitate broader participation and engagement from the research community. This open approach promotes transparency and encourages researchers to build upon our work, accelerating progress in multimodal data processing. As we continue to refine our baseline systems and explore new methodologies, we anticipate further advancements in our understanding of human behavior and communication across different modalities. Through ongoing collaboration and experimentation within the MuSe 2024 framework, we hope to drive innovation and ultimately contribute to the development of more effective multimodal machine learning systems for behavioral modeling and affective analysis.",
