      "text": "motion recognition (ER) plays a significant role in affective human-machine interactions. The purpose of ER is to retrieve the affective status of human beings at a particular point in time given a relevant data recording from an individual. There is a high possibility for applications in medical-care systems, such as active and assisted living module  [1] , driver-assistance systems  [2] , early detection of depression  [3] , and autistic spectral disorders  [4] . Feasible clues for an ER task include body gestures  [5] , facial expressions  [6] , speech  [7] , eye blinking  [8] , and neurophysiological signals  [9] -  [10] . Among them, neurophysiological signals have a capability to reflect the inner cognitive states of individuals and make impartial ER systems possible  [11] .\n\nIn our study, we concentrated on leveraging the ongoing electroencephalography (EEG) to build a functional ER system. Previous studies on cognitive psychology demonstrated the association between affective information of the human emotional state and the electrical activity of the cerebral cortex. The EEG can be a direct consequence of specific affective stimuli  [12] . Nevertheless, extracting emotional indicators from the EEG is difficult because of the individual differences, non-stationarity, and the artifacts induced by eye movement and respiration. A promising solution for the identification of salient information in the EEG associated with human affective responses is to build reliable feature representations and pattern classification models with ML tools.\n\nIn particular, there is a statistical significance in the way individuals sense and express their feelings  [13] . People may express distinct feelings and cortical responses when exposed to an identical effective stimulus  [14] . Therefore, the pattern classifier of interpreting EEG may not yield the right choice with regard to the context of various users of an ER system  [15] . Accordingly, many studies tend to focus on the design of specific ER systems. However, this classification model requires a large part of the gathered EEG samples from a specific person, and the recorded EEG could not be utilized for unseen individuals.\n\nAccordingly, studies into cross-individual ER systems based on machine learning models have been investigated. This signifies that a classifier can transfer knowledge pertaining to EEG data distribution among multiple ER users  [16] .\n\nIn such circumstances, the ER model is trained and tested by different individuals. It significantly reduces the time cost for recording EEG signals from the same person given that the size of the available training data is enlarged when multiple users are involved. However, the current cross-individual approach to EEG classification tends to perform poorly compared with the individual-specific approach because of the severe individual differences of EEG data E distributions  [17]  To model the mapping between EEG data and emotional states more accurately based on a cross-individual paradigm, we adopted deep-learning (DL) methods  [18] . There have been numerous successful utilizations of DL to the broad-scale image, voice, and video data. In contrast to many static images, EEG signals are multichannel, nonlinear time series, and the quantity of instances in numerous public databases is limited, thus making this modality less sufficient for training broad-scale networks that contain millions of parameters. Therefore, current convolutional neural network (CNN) models based on the DL principle have to leverage data augmentation and model regularization techniques. In this study, the CNN is applied as a basis to develop the cross-individual ER system. The CNN-based emotion classifier is trained based on end-to-end learning of the abstract features from the deep-scale original data.\n\nTo improve the characterization of the dynamical properties in the EEG features across multiple users of the ER system, we introduce a dynamic entropy-based pattern learning (DEPL) framework to smooth out short-term fluctuations and highlight long-term trends or cycles of feature representations. The DEPL first introduces differential entropy (DE) to characterize EEG signals  [19] . The spatial information that is coded in the electrode placement in the cerebral cortex is extracted by transferring DE features to interpretable two-dimensional (2-D) maps. In particular, the squeeze-excitation (SE) block  [20]  is employed to enhance the capability of deep representations of DE features by modeling the interdependencies between the channels of its informative features. Finally, the CNN classifiers are trained separately based on the classical EEG frequency bands of theta, alpha, beta, and gamma, to predict the final affective states. The public datasets DEAP  [21]  and MAHNOB-HCI  [22]  are adopted to validate the effectiveness of the proposed method.\n\nIn summary, our main contributions are three folds:\n\n(1) The DEPL deep learning system is first introduced to the EEG based affective computing for cross individual emotion recognition.\n\n(2) A method of salient region extraction based on attention mechanism is designed in the DEPL. The inter-channel dependencies have been evaluated along with the high-level feature representation.\n\n(3) The validation of the DEPL and various deep learning models shows connections between different structures of CNNs and the corresponding generalization capability.\n\nThis study is organized as follows. In section II, we introduce related work in the field of EEG-based affective computing. Section III describes the data preprocessing steps of the DEAP and MAHNOB-HCI databases. The details of the proposed DEPL framework are presented in Section IV. The experiments for performance evaluation and comparison of the ER system are given in section V. The discussions of the results and the conclusion of the study are presented in sections VI and VII, respectively.",

Atkinson and Campos  [24]  used the minimum-redundancy maximum-relevance (mRMR) method for feature selection, and the support vector machine (SVM) for the binary classification of low/high valence and arousal for individual-dependent emotion recognition based on data from the DEAP database. Yoon and Chung  [25]  presented a classification method based on the Pearson correlation coefficient and Bayesian models that achieved accuracies of 70.9% for valence and 70.1% for arousal. In  [26] , the level feature fusion (LFF) algorithm was employed to extract emotional EEG features, and the SVM with a Gaussian kernel was used as the classifier. The model obtained an accuracy of 68.8% for valence and 63.6% for arousal for binary classification, and 59.57% for valence and 57.44% for arousal for three-class classification of the MAHNOB database.\n\nIn  [27] , a DL model was used based on the long-short term memory framework to classify low/high valence and arousal based on the EEG raw data from the DEAP database, with accuracies of 85.45% and 85.65%. In  [28] , a three-dimensional (3-D) CNN-based scheme was applied to classify emotional states, and achieved a mean accuracy of 87.44% for valence and 88.49% for arousal on the DEAP dataset. The training samples were summed by an augmentation process following the superposition of noise on the original EEG sequences.\n\nMost of the existing work on individual, independent ER tasks tends to perform poorly compared with the individual-specific approaches. Li et al.  [29]  adopted the SVM classifier based on the automatic feature selection methods and the \"leave-one-subject-out\" verification strategy to evaluate the ER performance on the DEAP database based on which the highest mean recognition accuracy of 59.06% was achieved for binary classification.

Specifically, this database includes 32-channel EEG and peripheral physiological signals. Each participant was asked to watch 40 trials of music videos (one-minute per video) with different emotional stimuli. The EEG signals of these volunteers were recorded simultaneously. The volunteers then rated the videos on a scale of 1 to 9 in terms of arousal, valence, liking, dominance, and familiarity.\n\nIn this study, we only focused on 2-D emotional models where the arousal (ranging from weak to strong) and valence dimensions (ranging from negative to positive) were adopted to generate target-affective states. The 40 stimulus videos included 20 low-arousal/valence clips and 20 high-arousal/valence clips. Only the EEG data in the DEAP were used for deep-network modelling that had been downsampled to 128 Hz. The frequency component (in the range of 4-45 Hz) was preserved by band-pass filtering and ocular artifacts were removed by blind source separation algorithms. The duration of the denoised EEG in each trial was 63 s. Of these, 60 s were experimental data (recorded while watching the video), and 3 s were pre-trial baseline data (before watching), which contained a total number of samples of (60 + 3) × 128 = 8064 for each channel. Similarly, the MAHNOB-HCI database contains EEG, video, audio, gaze, and peripheral physiological recordings from 30 participants. Each participant watched 20 clips extracted from Hollywood movies and video websites. The stimulus videos ranged in duration from 35 s to 117 s. Their perceived arousal and valence levels were also labelled on a discrete scale from 1 to 9. Given that the EEG data were incomplete in the cases of six participants, only the data from 24 participants were available. The sampling frequency of the EEG was also 128 Hz, and the average potential was used as a reference value to measure the EEG potential difference. High-pass filters were employed to perform artifact removal. Specifically, for each trial of the EEG, a 60 s segment from the first 5 s to the 65 s time-point were used in the following analysis. We then divided these EEG recordings to high-class (ratings 6-9) and a low-class (ratings 1-5)\n\nrecordings. Table  I  shows a summary of the DEAP and MAHNOB-HCI datasets.\n\n...",

Recent studies have revealed that the deep feature representations can be boosted by introducing learning mechanisms into the network that support catch-spatial correlations between features.

This descriptor intends to generate an embedding of the global spatial information of channel-wise feature responses so that the functional signal from the global receptive field can be used by its lower layer. The information aggregated in the squeeze operation is followed by an excitation action. It is in the form of a simple self-gating mechanism that embeds as an input, and generates a set of modulation weights for each channel.

      "text": "The competitive performance of the proposed DEPL framework for tackling ER tasks in cross-individual paradigms is mainly attributed to three aspects.\n\n(1) The DEPL is able to eliminate short-term fluctuations and highlight long-term trends in EEG data with the use of dynamical feature smoothing. This allows DEPL to track the temporal dynamics of the affective status over time.  (2)  The benefits of the DL allow it to be capable to abstract structural data built by locating all EEG channels in a matrix.\n\nDeep networks are superior to shallow learning machines because they introduce the layer-wise convolution operations for feature-synthesis, and because they minimize possible inter-individual inconsistencies associated with high-dimensional feature maps. (3) Moreover, the SE-block in conjunction with the Swish activation function efficiently models the interdependencies between the channels, and helps the DEPL converge faster. The observation that the gamma frequency band is superior to the performance gained by the theta, alpha, and beta bands, indicates the significance of high-frequency cortical activities in affective computing. The potential reason is attributed to the fact that the gamma waves are heavily involved in the human reasoning and thinking procedures. For the parameter settings of the DEPL, the initial weights learned from different participants are unable to help the DEPL to converge faster owing to the low-migration ability of the current CNN structure. In fact, this implies that the types of the EEG responses are considerable among different individuals involved in the same ER task.\n\nIn Table  VIII , the performance of the DEPL is compared with recently reported publication findings. In general, the values of the accuracy obtained from the individual-dependent ER systems (exceeded 90%) are far better than those from the cross-individual models (approximately 60%). We found that the DEPL could facilitate much more emotionally relevant feature patterns to achieve better performance, particularly for both the DEAP and MAHNOB databases, compared with the existing methods. However, it should be carefully noted that the size of the training set, data pre-processing steps, and definitions of the emotional classes could be different, even when subjected to the same training and testing paradigms. These factors could significantly affect the final ER accuracy listed in the table.\n\nThrough the comparative analysis presented above, the DEPL may contribute to the improved tracking of the temporal dynamics of the affective status from the EEG signals with respect to time to enable cross-individual emotional recognition. The limitations of the current study mainly refer to two points.  (1)  We only extracted the DE features from raw EEG signals, and did not explore the other entropy measures, such as ApEn  [54] , fuzzy entropy  [55] , and multiscale entropy  [56] . Different entropy measures may capture informative features from EEG signals in specific emotional states.  (2)  The DEPL was trained on four frequency bands independently to investigate the performance differences and locate the best bands. However, the proper fusion of the four models may result in a higher generalization capacity. It can also be noted that the cross-individual ER task is still difficult because the accuracy is far from the perfect even for binary affective states.",
