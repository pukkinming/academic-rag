      "text": "Brain-computer interface (BCI) provides a direct communication pathway between human brain and external devices. Before a new subject could use BCI, a calibration procedure is usually required. Because the inter-and intra-subject variances are so large that the models trained by the existing subjects perform poorly on new subjects. Therefore, effective subject-transfer and calibration method is essential. In this paper, we propose a semi-supervised meta learning (SSML) method for subject-transfer learning in BCIs. The proposed SSML learns a meta model with the existing subjects first, then fine-tunes the model in a semi-supervised learning manner, i.e. using few labeled and many unlabeled samples of target subject for calibration. It is significant for BCI applications where the labeled data are scarce or expensive while unlabeled data are readily available. To verify the SSML method, three different BCI paradigms are tested: 1) event-related potential detection; 2) emotion recognition; and 3) sleep staging. The SSML achieved significant improvements of over 15% on the first two paradigms and 4.9% on the third. The experimental results demonstrated the effectiveness and potential of the SSML method in BCI applications.",

      "text": "Brain-computer interface (BCI) is a system to record and decode signals of human brain for the communication with external devices  [1] . It provides a direct communication pathway between the paralyzed patients or those with severe motor impairments and the real world. Electroencephalogram (EEG) is widely used in practical BCI systems because EEG is cheap, easy to use, and has relative high temporal resolution among all the other non-invasive techniques.\n\nThere were many different kinds of EEG-based BCI applications, such as eventrelated potential detection  [2] , emotion recognition  [3] , sleep stage classification  [4] , etc. For different application scenarios, there are many different kinds of BCI paradigms and different types of EEG signals. For example, affective BCI is to utilize BCI system to detect, process, and respond to the emotional states of subjects  [5] . To facilitate the research of EEG-based emotion recognition, SJTU emotion EEG dataset (SEED) was released  [6] . Many EEG emotion recognition algorithms were evaluated on the SEED dataset. Moreover, EEGbased BCI system could be applied to record, process and monitor the sleep stages of the chronic insomnia  [7] . In order to automatically recognize the sleep stages, many machine learning algorithms were proposed and evaluated on a benchmark dataset, i. e. Sleep-EDF dataset  [8] . BCI platform based on eventrelated potential (ERP) could be used to investigate age-related changes in brain function  [9] , external associate and communicate devices for disabled subjects  [2] , etc. As a matter of fact, advanced EEG decoding techniques are essential for the application and deployment of BCI systems.\n\nIn the current BCI applications, the EEG decoding performance is mainly affected by the various EEG signals of different subjects in different time. Specifically, EEG signals rapidly change over times due to the influence of circumstance, the fluctuation of BCI system and physiological/psychological conditions of subjects  [1] . In addition, there are large inter-subject and intra-subject variances of EEG signals of different subjects, such as spatial origin, mental conditions, brain shapes, rhythms, feature types, etc  [10] . As a result, the models trained by the existing subjects or data are unlikely suitable for the other subjects or the same subject in a different time  [11] . Therefore, calibration procedure is required for a new subject before using BCI system.\n\nTo calibrate EEG decoding models for new subjects, different kinds of methods were proposed. For example, transfer Learning methods for cross-subject EEG classification in BCI systems had attracted much attention in the past few years  [12] . To effectively deploy EEG-based sensorimotor BCI system, a crosssubject EEG decoding method was proposed  [13] . Transfer learning method based on riemannian geometry was effective for cross-subject classification in BCI applications  [14] . A new convolutional neural network, termed Dynamic-Net, achieved state-of-the-art performance of cross-subject classification in motor imagery  [15] . Domain adaption technique is able to learn knowledge from source domain and transfer to a new target domain. An easy domain adaptation method was proposed for cross-subject multi-view emotion recognition  [16] . However, it is difficult and time-consuming to collect sufficient high-quality labeled data for calibration. And the current cross-subject decoding methods could not compensate the large inter-and intra-subject variance of subjects in different circumstances. Therefore, effective subject-transfer and calibrating method is significant. Meta learning, known as learning to learn is a specific machine learning methodology which aims to learn knowledge or experience from meta data or source domain and effectively learn new tasks in the target domain. Recently, meta learning method was proven to be a powerful tool to capture common knowledge or experiences of different subjects which could be transferred to a new incoming subject for better decoding performance  [17, 18, 19] . Usually, a meta learning method will firstly train a meta learner with many labeled samples of source subjects and fine-tune/calibrate meta learner with few-shot labeled samples for a new incoming subject  [20, 21, 22] . A few-shot relation learning method was proposed for cross-subject motor imagery classification performance  [23] . The relation learning method was applied to learn representative features of unseen subject categories and how to classify them with limited number of samples. A prototype network based on SPD matrix was proposed for domain adaptation EEG emotion recognition  [24] . The proposed prototype network could transfer knowledge by feature adaptation with distribution confusion and sample adaptation with centroid alignment. Siamese neural network is a specific meta learning method based on metric between samples. A multimodal-Siamese neural network was applied for person verification  [25] . These studies demonstrated that meta learning methods are promising for subject-transfer EEG decoding and calibration in BCIs.\n\nTo reduce the discrepancy between target and source distributions, meta learning method like model agnostic meta-learning (MAML) could be applied for subject-transfer learning  [26] . With MAML method, EEG decoding network could be pre-trained by the averaged gradients of source subjects and fine-tune the network with just few-shot labeled samples of a new incoming subject for his/her calibration  [4, 27] . However, one major problem of the MAML method is that the calibration procedure using only few samples will cause over-fitting and performance degradation on target subject. Because only a small fraction of labeled samples are unlikely to capture intrinsic data distribution of target subject. Generally, the labeled data are scarce or expensive while unlabeled data are readily available in BCI applications and neuroscience studies. Therefore, semi-supervised learning methods are received much attention.\n\nIn this paper, we combine semi-supervised learning and meta learning methods to transfer EEG decoding models for new subjects just with few-shot labeled and many unlabeled samples. The main contributions of this paper can be summarized as follows:\n\n1. A novel semi-supervised meta learning (SSML) method is proposed for subject-transfer EEG decoding.\n\n2. The proposed method is flexible for different BCI paradigms including event-related potential detection, emotion recognition and sleep staging tasks.\n\n3. The SSML could significantly improve EEG decoding performance on new subjects, e.g. improvements of over 15% in ERP and emotion paradigms and 4.9% in the sleep paradigm.\n\nThe remainder of this paper is organized as follows. The proposed SSML method is presented in Section II. In Section III, numerical experiments on event-related potential detection, emotion recognition and sleep staging datasets are carried out. And the performance of the current methods and the proposed method are presented and compared. Some discussions and analysis of the proposed method are presented in Section IV. Conclusions of this paper are given in Section V.",

      "text": "Meta learning is to learn model for a variety of tasks and achieve best performance on a distribution of tasks, including potentially unseen tasks. In practical, the subject-transfer learning in BCI could be considered as a meta learning problem that each task refer to the classification of each subjects neural signals.\n\nMeta learning approaches could be categorized into three kinds, i. e. modelbased, metric-based and optimization-based  [28] . Model-based method relies on designing suitable models for fast learning on new task. Metric-based approach aims to learn a good kernel of distance metric which is applicable to common tasks as well as the unseen tasks. Optimization-based method could adjust the optimization algorithm on new task after learning a few examples.\n\nModel-agnostic meta-learning (MAML) is a fairly general optimization algorithm, compatible with any model that learns through gradient descent  [26] .\n\nAccording to the recent studies  [29, 30, 31, 32, 4] , MAML method achieved impressive performance in different kinds of few-shot learning problems.\n\nHere is a dataset D =< S, Q > where S = {(X s , Y s )} is a support set of source subjects with EEG samples X s and the associated labels Y s , and\n\nis a query set of a target subject with unlabeled sample X q . The subject-transfer learning problem in BCI is to learn a model with the support set and apply the model on target subject to predict the labels of query set. The model's parameter θ * is optimized as follow:\n\nwhere p denotes the posterior probability of the classifier to classify a given sample x to a specific class y in support set S. By maximizing the expectation E of support set, the model is optimized. Furthermore, the optimized model could be applied on target subject to predict the labels of query set.\n\nAs shown in Algorithm 1, MAML algorithm is to learn a meta-learner by a support set with N s source subjects S = {(X s , Y s )} Ns s=1 . Given a model f θ with parameters θ, it could be optimized by gradient descent approach as\n\nwhere L denotes the loss between the model's output probability and the associated label of the given data T i of the i-th source subject, ∇ θ is the gradient computed by the loss, α is the learning rate.\n\nThe above optimized parameters θ * i is just for one subject. For better generalization across the other subjects, we sample a subset of M subjects from source S and train a meta-learner for more efficient subject-transfer learning.\n\nThe meta-learner's parameters could be optimized by the averaged gradients of multiple source subjects as Sample a subset of M subjects from source S.",

Therefore, it is of great interests to develop a semi-supervised learning method which could exploit labeled and unlabeled data to fine-tune the model for target subject. According to the previous research, semi-supervised learning method was used for brain signal feature extraction  [33, 34, 35]  and improving signal decoding performance for EEG-based emotion recognition, sleep stage classification, diagnosis of brain disease, etc  [36, 37, 38, 39] .\n\nHere, we proposed a semi-supervised meta learning (SSML) algorithm for subject-transfer EEG decoding as shown in The joint loss function which combines center loss and cross entropy loss is as follows.\n\nwhere h i denotes the output feature of the last hidden layer of the backbone network given the i-th input sample, c yi is the y i -th class center, p i is the output of the network, y i is the ground truth, L S is cross-entropy classification loss, λ is the weight of center loss L C . The feature center c yi for each class is considered as learnable parameters which is learned by gradient descent method  [40] . Its gradient is as follows.\n\nwhere δ(condition) = 1 if the condition is satisfied, and δ(condition) = 0 if not.\n\nBased on the Algorithm 1, the backbone network is pre-trained by the joint loss function as shown in Fig.  1 . Then, the pre-trained network is fine-tuned in a semi-supervised manner with few-shot labeled EEG signals\n\nand unlabeled signals X t = {x j } of the target subject.\n\nIn the semi-supervised adaption phase, only part of the unlabeled signals are eligible and selected for fine-tuning. First, each unlabeled signal x i ∈ X t is fed into the network to obtain its feature h j and the corresponding output o j as shown in Algorithm 2. Second, the argmax function is applied to transform the network output o j into the artificial label y j and the associated predict Algorithm 2 Semi-supervised meta learning algorithm Require: Pre-trained network f θ , base learning rate α, fine-tuning rate γ, confidence and distance thresholds ε, ς.\n\nRequire: Few-shot labeled signals T q = {(x q , y q )} Nq q=1 and unlabeled signals for all T j do 8:\n\nUpdate base learner parameters θ * :\n\nend for 10:\n\nUpdate meta-learner parameters θ:\n\n] 11: end while probability p j .

The feature distance from center d j and the support set are defined as follows:\n\nwhere n is the length of each feature vector h j for normalization of feature Consequently, the fine-tuned model could be applied for classification tasks of the target subject. With a semi-supervised adaption, the proposed SSML method utilizes labeled and unlabeled data to achieve better EEG decoding performance for new incoming target subject. Next, we will conduct a series of experiments to evaluate the proposed SSML method and compare it with the other methods.",

For example, seven of the eight subjects in ERP dataset are selected as source subjects for training while the rest one is the target subject for testing.

To study the performance variances of the proposed method on different network structures, we built three kinds of networks including multi-layer perception (MLP), spatial-temporal filtering neural network (STNN) and convolutional neural network (CNN).\n\nIn To train the backbone network, we applied Adam optimizer with base learning rate of 0.001 and meta learning rate of 0.0001. To learn feature centers for different classes, stochastic gradient descent optimizer is applied with a learning rate of 0.001 and a center-loss weight of 0.001.
