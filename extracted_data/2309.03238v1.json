Sagarika (Sagarika Srishti), for all her support, both in India and when she came to the US. Her move to the US during my PhD was a major personal highlight. Ariba (Ariba Javed), thanks for all the discussions, talks, and emotional conversations, and for always being up for anything interesting, including a pottery class. Shobhit (Shobhit Narain) has been an amazing companion, helping me with job applications and always being the sarcastic, serious, yet most helpful guy I have had the pleasure of calling a friend. And finally, Sai (Sairam Tabibu) helped me fill out the PhD application for UMich on the exact deadline, without which, I would not be here at all. This is probably an unconventional paragraph in acknowledgments, but these were unconventional times during COVID. For the two years of lockdown, I turned to Among Us when I felt lonely or lost in my research. I am really thankful for the streamers whose broadcasts provided some semblance of social interaction. For almost three years, I watched them stream at least 8 hours a day while I worked, to simulate a social environment. And when my research progress stalled, I turned to anonymous Discord communities, playing Among Us and golf for hours, which helped alleviate feelings of depression and sadness, providing a much-needed uplift. My PhD journey wasn't easy, and a lot happened over the six years, but I made it through.",

      "text": "I would like to start by expressing my profound gratitude towards my PhD advisor, Emily (Emily Mower Provost). She has been my go-to person for any research brainstorming and has shown me tremendous patience, support, and guidance throughout my PhD journey. Without her persistence and suggestions, completing this PhD would not have been possible. I am also incredibly grateful for my thesis committee members: Vinod (VG Vinod Vydiswaran), Nikola (Nikola Banovic), Benjamin (Benjamin Fish), and Douwe (Douwe Kiela). Their valuable insights during my thesis proposal helped shape the final version of the thesis.\n\nFor putting up with me during my PhD journey, my immense gratitude goes towards my family, especially my parents, grandparents, and Bert. My parents have been a rock for me over the past six years. Though I could not visit them often or talk to them much, they were always there when I needed someone. They seem to have aged fifteen years in the six years of my PhD, stressed about me, but their support never wavered. My mom (Archana Kumari) received her own PhD in 2021, and my dad (Abhay Kumar) became the Vice-Chancellor of a new IIIT-two accomplishments that were their lifelong dreams and inspired me immensely. I unfortunately lost two of my grandparents during the PhD program, and I will never forget their blessings and excitement for me embarking on my higher education journey. During early 2020, in the midst of COVID, I adopted a cat named Bert-yes, named after the language model. Without him, I would not have maintained my sanity during the dark, lonely nights and tiring, long work days. His purring loudly into my ear calmed me down on the worst of nights. I was lucky enough to secure three internships and have amazing research mentors for iii all of them. Ahmad (Ahmad Beirami) taught me how to approach Conversational AI, how to create effective presentations, and how to write research proposals. Adina (Adina Williams) taught me how to work with linguistics mixed in with NLP, and how subjectivity can infiltrate seemingly objective parts (like NLI) of NLP. Ana (Ana Marasović) was the first person I worked with on really large language models (foundational models), and she taught me how to approach evaluation and benchmarking for generative models-a major part of my current research path.\n\nI want to thank my lab members, starting with Zak (Zakaria  Aldeneh) . Zak exemplifies what all senior PhD mentors should be, helping me with code, brainstorming, and working with me on papers. He has been an amazing research collaborator. I also want to thank Minxue (Minxue Sandy Niu) for being the junior research collaborator anyone would be proud of. She has not only been an amazing collaborator but was also always willing to discuss interesting research problems. I want to thank Matt (Matthew Perez) for being the batchmate who has always been there to help, to vent, to advise, and to collaborate, serving as my go-to person for any speech-based research questions. Finally, I want to thank Amrit (Amrit Romana) for being an amazing lab member; her observant questions helped me immensely during lab presentations.\n\nI also want to thank my friends, without whom this journey would not have been possible. I will start with Abhinav (Abhinav Jangda), who has been my support system throughout my PhD journey, starting from the application process. Diksha (Diksha Dhawan) was the best PhD roommate one could ask for during the first four years of my PhD. She shared laughter and tears with me, cooked with me, and supported me through all the highs and lows.\n\nWithout her, I could not have survived my PhD. She taught me the value of being proud of my interests in both my personal and professional life, and how friends can sometimes be family, which is the best gift anyone could have given me. Eesh (Sudheesh Srivastava), for all the conversations at the intersection of machine learning, physics, and philosophy, has taught me about areas and theories that I would have otherwise not encountered in any  Close-up view of the thermal and video recording equipment. . . . . . .",

To address these complexities, the thesis makes several key contributions.\n\nTo The findings from this research provide valuable insights into the nuances of emotion labeling, modeling techniques, and interpretation frameworks for robust emotion recognition.\n\nThe novel datasets collected help encapsulate the environmental and personal variability prevalent in real-world emotion expression.

      "text": "In human communication, perceiving and responding to others' emotions in interpersonal conversations play a crucial role  [76] . To create systems that can aid in human-centered interpersonal situations, it is necessary for these systems to possess the capability to recognize emotions effectively  [220] . Robust Emotion Recognition (ER) models can be beneficial in various situations, such as crisis text lines or passive mental health monitoring  [160] .\n\nHowever, these ML models often lack robustness when faced with unseen data situations, making deploying them in high-risk situations or healthcare a challenging task  [241] .\n\nRecongizing emotion is a challenging task because it is subjective in both perception and production  [178] . The labels used to train emotion recognition models are perceptually subjective  [28] . The same emotion can be perceived differently by different people, depending on their cultural background, personal experiences, and other factors  [147] . Additionally, there is production subjectivity. The same emotion can be expressed differently by different people, depending on their individual personality, cultural background, physiological and other factors  [13] . The subjectivity of emotion recognition makes it difficult to develop accurate and robust models that account for these numerous variations  [221] .\n\nIn addition to the challenges posed by subjectivity, there are challenges that relate to the information that is learned in addition to and beyond the expression of emotion itself. The manner in which emotions are expressed are correlated with a person's demographic and identifying features. Hence, systems trained to recognize emotion can often learn implicit associations between an individual's demographic factors and emotion  [208] . When used as a component in larger systems, these implicit associations can lead to either the leakage of demographic information, or can bias the larger system's output based on demographic information, even when not explicitly trained to do so.\n\nTraining any robust machine learning model necessitates having access to large amounts of diverse and labelled data. Training models for emotion recognition faces the challenge of not having access to large quantities of diverse data. Scraping data over the internet, as is done for other areas, leads to a dataset that is often demographically biased, and, often exaggerated for entertainment purposes. On the other hand, data collected in laboratory environments is intentionally cleaner and often exaggerated in case of scripted sessions.\n\nTherefore, both of these data collection methods do not encapsulate possible environmental and personal factors, which leads to models often being trained on either highly skewed or non-representative data. The resulting models are either fragile or biased, and ultimately unable to handle real-world variability.\n\nIn this dissertation, critical facets of emotion recognition are thoroughly explored, beginning with the collection of datasets, which take into account psychological factors in producing emotions. This is followed closely by examining the influence that alterations in data augmentation processes have on emotion labels, while also challenging and interrogating the validity of previously established labels. Alterations in labeling techniques and the resulting effects on annotator-assigned labels are also scrutinized. Simultaneously, the research develops robust models specifically trained to disregard certain physiological emotion production factors. Integral to the research is the creation of bimodal models that generate representations aiming to tackle the reduction of leakage of sensitive demographic variables. The concluding portion of the study involves an in-depth evaluation of the robustness and impartiality of these models, carried out in a human-centric manner, ensuring an emphasis on minimal costs for data annotation. From this extensive research, valuable insights are gained into the complexities of emotion recognition, which pave the way for more nuanced and robust labeling, modeling, and interpretation techniques. It also lays the groundwork for future efforts in the development of robust and cost-effective emotion recognition models.",

      "text": "Various theories of emotion provide insights into the challenges faced in developing computational models for emotion recognition in speech or text. Below, we discuss the relevance and implications of some prominent theories in the context of speech or text-based (bimodal) emotion recognition.\n\n• James-Lange Theory and Cannon-Bard Theory  [204] : Both theories emphasize physiological responses' importance in emotion. In speech or text-based recognition, it is vital to consider correlations between observable features (e.g., vocal tonality, speech patterns) and underlying physiological responses. Accounting for these correlations can help capture emotions, even though the relationship might be subjective due to personal and cultural differences.\n\n• Schachter-Singer Two-Factor Theory  [204] : This theory stresses the importance of both physiological arousal and cognitive appraisal for experiencing emotions.\n\nIn speech or text-based emotion recognition, cognitive appraisal aspects such as semantic content, contextual factors, and discourse patterns can be extracted. However, the subjectivity of cognitive appraisal processes presents challenges given personal experiences' impact on interpretation.\n\n• Lazarus Cognitive-Mediational Theory  [204] : Centered around the role of cognitive appraisal, this theory highlights the need for emotion recognition systems to account for individuals' interpretations of situations through cues that may suggest appraisal (e.g., word choice, phrase structure, conversational context). Advanced models might need to factor in users' personal and demographic features to better understand cognitive appraisal processes. This approach introduces more subjectivity and potential privacy concerns, as individual perspectives and experiences can vary significantly.\n\nIntegrating insights from these theories can aid unraveling the complexities and subjective nature of emotions expressed through language, as speech or text-based emotion recognition relies primarily on linguistic patterns, tone, and content analysis.",

This subjectivity is intensified by both personal physiological responses to stimuli and cultural context.\n\nDimensional emotional labels describe emotions across two dimensions, valence (sad to happy) and arousal (calm to excited). The dimensional approach is more consistent with the James-Lange and Cannon-Bard theories, addressing the physiological components of emotions, as well as the cognitive components emphasized by the Schachter-Singer Two-Factor Theory and Lazarus Cognitive-Mediational Theory.

These models strive to understand the nuances of language, cultural expressions, and individual semantic and contextual differences in recognizing emotions.\n\nMulti-modal models exploit relevant information from text, audio, or video to form powerful emotion recognition models.

Emotion recognition models may spuriously correlate these stress-based factors to perceived emotion labels, which could limit generalization to other datasets. Consequently, we hypothesize that controlling for stress variations can improve the models' generalizability. To achieve this, we employ adversarial networks to decorrelate stress modulations from emotion representations, examining the impact of stress on both acoustic and lexical emotion predictions. By isolating stress-related factors from emotion representations, we aim to enhance the model's ability to generalize across different stress conditions.

This learning behavior poses a risk to user privacy, as the models inadvertently capture sensitive demographic information. Storing representations instead of raw data does not fully mitigate this issue, as latent variables can still compromise user privacy. To address this challenge, we present approaches for mitigating the learning of certain demographic factors in emotion recognition embeddings. Furthermore, we tackle the issue of user-level membership identification by employing an adversarial network that strips this information from the final encoding, reduced leakage of sensitive information from generated representations.",

This helps the model learn a wider range of emotion patterns and improves its ability to generalize to unseen data  [137] .\n\nAnother technique that has been investigated is transfer learning, which involves leveraging knowledge acquired from pre-trained models on a related task and applying it to the emotion recognition task. By transferring the learned representations and weights from a pre-trained model, the model can benefit from the general knowledge and feature extraction capabilities it has acquired, leading to improved generalizability in emotion recognition  [137] .\n\nFurthermore, researchers have also explored the concept of generalizability from the perspective of noisy signals.

For this chatbot agent to be effective, it needs to respond differently when the user is stressed and upset versus when the user is calm and upset, which is a common strategy in counselor training  [213] . While virtual agents have made successful strides in understanding the task-based intent of the user, social human-computer interaction can still benefit from further research  [54] . Successful integration of virtual agents into real-life social interaction requires machines to be emotionally intelligent  [27, 238] .\n\nBut humans are complex in nature, and emotion is not expressed in isolation  [90] . Instead, it is affected by various external factors. These external factors lead to interleaved user states, which are a culmination of situational behavior, experienced emotions, psychological or physiological state, and personality traits. One of the external factors that affects psychological state is stress. Stress can affect everyday behavior and emotion, and in severe states, is associated with delusions, depression and anxiety due to impact on emotion regulation mechanisms  [122, 193, 216, 225] . Virtual agents can respond in accordance to users' emotions only if the machine learning systems can recognize these complex user states and correctly perceive users' emotional intent. We introduce a dataset designed to elicit spontaneous emotional responses in the presence or absence of stress to observe and sample complex user states.\n\nThere has been a rich history of visual  [235, 111] , speech  [143] , linguistic  [207] , and multimodal emotion datasets  [38, 36, 183] . Vision datasets have focused both on facial movements  [111]  and body movement  [131] . Speech datasets have been recorded to capture both stress and emotion separately but do not account for their inter-dependence  [185, 97, 127, 243] . Stress datasets often include physiological data  [234, 210] .\n\nExisting datasets are limited because they are designed to elicit emotional behavior, while neither monitoring external psychological state factors nor minimizing their impact by relying on randomization. However, emotions produced by humans in the real world are complex. Further, our natural expressions are often influenced by multiple factors (e.g., happiness and stress) and do not occur in isolation, as typically assumed under laboratory conditions. The primary goal of this work is to collect a multimodal stress+emotion dataset  For MuSE, The extracted features for each modality, and the anonymized dataset (other than video) will be released publicly along with all the corresponding data and labels. We present baseline results for recognizing both emotion and stress in the chapter, in order to validate that the presence of these variables can be computationally extracted from the dataset, hence enabling further research.",

The protocol for data collection is shown in Figure  4 .1. There were two sections in each recording: monologues and watching emotionally evocative videos. We measure the stress level at the beginning and end of each recording. The monologue questions and videos were specifically chosen to cover all categories of emotions. At the start of each recording, we also recorded a short one-minute clip without any additional stimuli to register the baseline state of the subject.\n\nPrevious research has elicited situational stress such as public speaking  [123, 85, 8] , mental arithmetic tasks  [139]  or use Stroop Word Test  [215] . However, these types of stress are often momentary and fade rapidly in two minutes  [139] . We alleviate this concern by recording both during and after final exams (we anticipate that these periods of time are associated with high stress and low stress, respectively) in April 2018. We measure stress using Perceived Stress Scale  [57]  for each participant. We measure their self-perception of the emotion using Self-Assessment Manikins (SAM)  [30] . The recordings and the survey measures were coordinated using Qualtrics1 enabling us to ensure minimal intervention and limit the effect of the presence of another person on the emotion production.\n\nEach monologue section comprised of five questions broken into sections meant to elicit a particular emotion (Table  4 .1). These questions were shown to elicit thoughtful and emotional responses in their data pool to generate interpersonal closeness  [11] . We include an icebreaker and ending question to ensure cool off periods between change in recording section, i.e., from neutral to monologues, and from monologues to videos, hence decreasing the amount of carry-over emotion from the previous monologue to the next. Each subject was presented with a different set of questions over the two recordings to avoid repetition effect. We also shuffle the order of the other three questions to account for order effects  [133] .\n\nEach subject was asked to speak for a minimum of two minutes. After their response to each question, the subjects marked themselves on two emotion dimensions: activation and valence on a Likert Scale of one to nine using self-assessment manikins  [30] .\n\nFor the second part of the recording, the subjects were asked to watch videos in each of the four quadrants i.e., the combination of {low, high} × {activation, valence} of emotion.\n\nThese clips were selected from the corpus  [140, 20] , which tested for the emotion elicited from the people when watching these clips (Table  4 .2). The subjects were monitored for 1umich.qualtrics.com their reaction to the clips. After viewing a clip, subjects are asked to speak for thirty seconds about how the video made them feel. After their response, they marked a emotion category, e.g., angry, sad, etc. for the same clip. When switching videos, the subjects were asked to view a one-minute neutral clip to set their physiological and thermal measures back to the baseline  [189] .\n\nThe 28 participants were also asked to fill out an online survey used for personality measures on the big-five scale  [87] , participation being voluntary. This scale has been validated to measure five different dimensions named OCEAN (openness, conscientiousness, extraversion, agreeableness, and neuroticism) using fifty questions and has been found to correlate with passion  [60] , ambition  [19] , and emotion mechanisms  [181] . We received responses for this survey from 18 participants. These labels can be used in further work to evaluate how these personality measures interact with the affects of stress in emotion production, as previously studied in  [242] .",

This helps reduce the size of the thermal recording files after being zipped.\n\nUtterance Construction. The five monologues extracted above were divided into utterances. However, since the monologues are a form of spontaneous speech, there are no clear sentence boundaries marking end of utterance. We manually created utterances by identifying prosodic or linguistic boundaries in spontaneous speech as defined by  [125] . or (c) a very long pause in thought. This method has been previously shown to be effective in creating utterances that mostly maintain a single level of emotion  [118] .\n\nThe dataset contains 2,648 utterances with a mean duration of 12.44 ± 6.72 seconds (Table  4 .3).

We remove utterances that are shorter than 3-seconds and longer than 35-seconds and end up retaining 97.2% of our dataset. This allows us to to avoid short segments that may not have enough information to capture emotion, and longer segments that can have variable emotion, as mentioned in  [118] . Because our dataset is comprised of spontaneous utterances, the mean length of utterance is larger than those in a scripted dataset  [38]  due to more corrections and speech overflow.",

We posted our experiments as Human\n\nIntelligence Tasks (HITs) on Amazon Mechanical Turk and used selection and training mechanisms to ensure quality  [106] . HITs were defined as sets of utterances in a monologue.\n\nThe workers were presented with a single utterance and were asked to annotate the activation and valence values of that utterance using Self-Assessment Manikins  [30] . Unlike the strategy adopted in  [47] , the workers could not go back and revise the previous estimate of the emotion. We did this to ensure similarity to how a human listening into the conversation might shift their perception of emotion in real time. These HITs were presented in either the contextual or the random presentation condition defined below.\n\nIn the contextual experiment, we posted each HIT as a collection of ordered utterances from each section of a subject's recording. Because each section's question was designed to elicit an emotion, to randomize the carry-over effect in perception, we posted the HITs in a random order over the sections from all the subjects in our recording. For example, a worker might see the first HIT as Utterance 1...N from Section 3 of Subject 4's stressed recording and see the second HIT as Utterance 1...M from Section 5 of Subject 10's non-stressed recording\n\nwhere N, M are the number of utterances in those sections respectively. This ensures that the annotator adapts to the topic and fluctuations in speaking patterns over the monologue being annotated.\n\nIn the randomized presentation, each HIT is an utterance from any section, by any speaker, to ensure lack of adaptation to both speaker specific style and the contextual information.\n\nThe per-utterance and the contextual labels can be used to train different machine learning models that are apt for either singular one-off instances or for holding multiple turn natural conversation, respectively.",

The eGeMAPS feature set consists of 88 utterance- level statistics over the low-level descriptors of frequency, energy, spectral, and cepstral parameters. We perform speaker-level 𝑧-normalization on all features.\n\n2. Lexical Features. We extract lexical features using Linguistic Inquiry and Word Count (LIWC)  [174] . These features have been shown to be indicative of stress, emotion, veracity and satisfaction  [86, 161, 164] . We normalize all the frequency counts by the total number of words in the sentence accounting for the variations due to utterance length.\n\n3. Thermal Features. For each subject a set of four regions were selected in the thermal image: the forehead area, the eyes, the nose and the upper lip as previously used in  [172, 80, 6] . These regions were tracked for the whole recording and a 150-bin histogram of temperatures was extracted from the four regions per frame, i.e., 30 frames a second for thermal recordings. We further reduced the histograms to the first four measures of central tendency, e.g. Mean, Standard Deviation, Skewness and Kurtosis. We combined these features over the utterance using first delta measures (min, max, mean, SD) of all the sixteen extracted measures per frame, resulting in 48 measures in total. 4. Close-up Video Features. We use OpenFace  [15]  to extract the subject's facial action units. The AUs used in OpenFace for this purpose are AU1, AU2, AU4, AU5, AU6, AU7, AU9, AU10, AU12, AU14, AU15, AU17, AU20, AU23, AU25, AU26, AU28 and AU25 comprising of eyebrows, eyes and mouth. These features have been previously\n\nshown to be indicative of emotion  [227, 64]  and have been shown to be useful for predicting deception  [110] . We summarize all frames into a feature using summary statistics (maximum, minimum, mean, variance, quantiles) across the frames and across delta between the frames resulting in a total of 144 dimensions.\n\nNetwork Setup. We train and evaluate multiple unimodal Deep Neural Networks (DNN) models for predicting valence and activation using Keras  [91] .  [106]  have shown that a match between the context provided to the classifier and the annotator leads to better classification performance. Because we are performing single utterance classification, for all further experiments, we use the annotations obtained in a random manner as mentioned above. In all cases, we predict the continuous annotation using regression.\n\nWe also use an ensemble of these four networks (audio, lexical, visual and thermal) to measure multimodal performance. For each network setup, we follow a five-fold subject We train our networks for a maximum of 50 epochs and monitor the validation loss after each epoch. We perform early stopping if the loss doesn't decrease for 15 consecutive epochs. We save the weights that achieved the lowest validation performance during training.\n\nWe train each network five times with different seeds and average the predictions to account for variations due to random initialization.\n\nResults. We show our results in Table  4 .4. We find that between acoustic and lexical modalities, the acoustic modality carries more information about activation and the lexical for valence. This is in line with previous research  [232, 39] . We also note that the visual modality significantly outperforms both the speech and lexical modalities for valence prediction.\n\nWhen we merge these networks using late voting on each modality (decision fusion), we find that the combination of all modalities performs the best for predicting activation. But for predicting valence, the best performance is shown by the combination of acoustic, lexical, visual and thermal modalities. We believe this is true because previous work has shown that thermal features are mostly indicative of intensity and discomfort  [94]  and hence improves performance on activation prediction, while the visual expressions are most informative about valence  [186] .",

Acoustic, Lexical, and Thermal Features. We use the same features as extracted for predicting emotion.\n\n2. Wide-angle Video Features. We extract the subject's pose using OpenPose  [40, 199, 228]  at 25 frames per second. For each frame, we extract 14 three-dimensional points representing anchor points for the upper body. For classification of each 3D point is interpolated over one second using a 5 𝑡ℎ order spline  [167, 102] . The parameters of the splines are then used as features for classification.\n\n3.

We train network to recognize stress vs non-stress situation in both neutral recording,i.e., when the subject isn't speaking at the beginning of the recording, and during emotional monologue questions. To do so, we decide the final prediction by a majority vote over one-second predictions for the complete section of the recording. For the lexical and acoustic modality, we train the network for the question monologues, and decide the final prediction based on a majority vote over prediction for each utterance.\n\nResults. We report our results for prediction of stress vs non-stress situation using various modalities in Table  4 .5. We see that the captured modalities are indeed informative for recognizing stress vs non-stressed situations. We find that for recognizing this distinction when the subjects are speaking, audio and physiological features perform the best. This is in agreement with previous related work  [131, 234, 96] . Interestingly, we also find that the thermal and physiological modality is apt at recognizing differences in stress, even in the neutral recording, i.e., when the subject is not speaking. This advantage of thermal modality has been previously documented by researchers  [7, 173, 172, 80] . We find that answering emotional monologue questions interferes with the recorded thermal modality, leading to a poorer performance at stress recognition.",

Often noise augmentation makes one important assumption, that the prediction label should remain the same in presence or absence of noise, which is true for automatic speech recognition but not necessarily true for perception based tasks. In this chapter we make three novel contributions. We validate through crowdsourcing that the presence of noise does change the annotation label and hence may alter the original ground truth label.

      "text": "Speech emotion recognition is increasingly included as a component in many real-world human-centered machine learning models. Modulations in speech can be produced for a multitude of reasons, both desirable and undesirable. In our case desirable modulations encode information that we want our model to learn and be informed by, such as speaker characteristics or emotion. Undesirable modulations encode information that are extrinsic factors change with the environment, such as noise. In order to handle these modulations, we need large datasets that capture the range of possible speech variations and their relationship to emotion expression. But, such datasets are generally not available for emotion tasks. To bridge this gap, researchers have proposed various methods to generate larger datasets. One of the most common is noise augmentation. The baseline assumption of noise augmentation is that the labels of the emotion examples do not change once noise has been added  [169] .\n\nWhile this assumption can be confidently made for tasks such as automatic speech recognition (ASR), the same cannot be said for perception-based tasks, such as emotion recognition.\n\nIn this chapter, we question the assumption that the annotation label remains the same in the presence of noise. We first create a noise augmented dataset and conduct a perception study to label the emotion of these augmented samples, focused on the type of noise in samples whose perception has changed or remained the same given the agumentation. We use the results from this study to classify the complete set of augmentation noises into two categories, perception-altering (i.e., noises that may change the perception of emotion) and perception-retaining (i.e., noises that do not change the perception of emotion). We propose that the perception-altering noises should not be used in supervised learning or evaluation frameworks because we cannot confidently maintain that the original annotation holds for a given sample. We evaluate the effects of disregarding emotion perception changes by examining how the performance of emotion recognition models and analyses of their robustness change in unpredictable manners when we include samples that alter human perception in the training of these models. Lastly, we provide a set of recommendations for noise based augmentation of speech emotion recognition datasets based on our results.\n\nResearchers have considered the impact of noise on emotion perception and thereby the annotation of emotions. In this chapter, we claim that the standard assumption about perception and hence, label retention of emotion in the presence of noise may not hold true in a multiple noise categories.\n\nTo understand which noises impact emotion perception, we use a common emotion dataset, IEMOCAP and introduce various kinds of noises to it, at varying signal to noise ratio (SNR) levels as well as at different positions in the sample. We then perform a crowdsourcing experiment that asks workers to annotate their perception of emotion for both the clean and the corresponding noise-augmented sample. This enables us to divide noise augmentation options into groups characterized by their potential to either influence or not influence human perception.\n\nThe results of the crowdsourcing experiments inform a series of empircal analyses focused on model performance and model robustness. We first present an empirical evaluation of the effects of including perception-altering noises in training. It will allow us to observe how the inclusion of perception-altering noises creates an impression of performance improvement.\n\nWe will discuss how this improvement is a myth, this new model will have learned to predict labels that are not truly associated with a given sample due to the perceptual effects of these noises. We consider both a general recurrent neural network (RNN) model and an We find that the crowdsourced labels do change in the presence of some kinds of noise.\n\nWe then verify that the models perform worse on noisy samples when trained only on clean datasets. But, we show that this decrease in performance is different when using the complete set of noises for augmenting the test set vs. when only using the perception-retaining noises for augmentation. We show similar patterns for noise-robust models, specifically\n\nshowing how there is an increased drop in performance for the end-to-end noise-robust model when excluding performance-altering noises during augmentation. We then discuss how our conventional metrics, those that look only at model performance, may be incorrectly asserting improvements as the model is learning to predict an emotion measure that is not in line with human perception. Troublingly, we find that the attack model is generally more effective when it has access to the set of all noises as compared to when excluding perception-altering noises for allowed augmentations. We also specifically find that given just a pool of carefully crafted reverberation modulations, the attack model can be successful in almost 65% of the cases with minimal degradation in SNR and in less than ten queries to the trained model. We end the chapter with a general set of recommendations for noise augmentations in speech emotion recognition datasets.",

      "text": "In this chapter, we investigate five research questions:\n\nPurpose 1: Premise Validation through Crowdsourcing RQ1: Does the presence of noise affect emotion perception as evaluated by human raters?\n\nIs this effect dependent on the utterance length, loudness, the type of the added noise, and the original emotion?\n\nReason: Noise has been known to have masking effect on humans in specific situations.\n\nHence, humans can often understand verbalized content even in presence of noise. Our goal is to understand whether the same masking effect extends to paralinguistic cues such as emotion, and to what extent. Our continuing claim from hereon remains that only noises that do not change human perception should be used for the training and evaluation of machine learning models. Not doing so, can lead to gains or drops in performance measurement that may not actually extend to real world settings. We call these changes \"unverified\" because we cannot, with certainity, be sure that the model should have predicted the original label (i.e., the label of the sample before noise was added) because the human did not neccessarily label the noisy instance with that same label.\n\nPurpose 2: Noise Impact Quantification RQ2: Can we verify previous findings that the presence of noise affects the performance of emotion recognition models? Does this effect vary based on the type of the added noise?\n\nReason: We have known that presence of noise in data shifts the data distribution  [50] .\n\nThis shift often leads to poor performance by machine learning models. We aim to quantify the amount of performance drop based on the type of noise in these systems, both, for any kind of noise, and then, specifically for noises that do not change human perception (perception-retaining).",

We ensured that each worker had > 98% approval rating and more than 500 approved Human Intelligence Tasks (HITs). We ensured that all workers understood the meaning of activation and valence using a qualification task that asked workers to rank emotion content similar to  [105] . The qualification task has two parts: (i) we explain the difference between valence and activation and how to identify those, and, (ii) we ask them to identify which of the two samples has a higher/lower valence and a higher/lower activation, to ensure that they have understood the concept of activation and valence annotations. All HIT workers were paid a minimum wage ($9.45/hr), pro-rated to the minute. Each HIT was annotated by three workers.\n\nFor our main task, we created pairs that contained one original and one modulated sample. We then asked each worker to annotate whether or not they perceived the pair to have the same emotion. If they said yes for both activation and valence, the noisy sample was labeled same and they could directly move to the next HIT. If they said no, the noisy sample was labeled different. In this case, they were asked to assess the activation and valence of the noisy sample using Self Assessment Manikins  [30]  on a scale of  [1, 5]  (similar to the original IEMOCAP annotation).\n\nWe also include three kinds of attention checks:\n\n1. We show two samples that have not been modified and ask them to decide if the emotion represented was different. If the person says yes, then the experiment ends.\n\n2. We observe the time spent on the task. If the time spent on the task is less than the combined length of both samples, then the user's qualification to annotate the HITs is rescinded and their responses are discarded.\n\n3. We show two samples, one which has a gold standard label, and another, which has been contaminated with significant noise (performance degradation >30dB), such that the resulting sample is incomprehensible. If people do not mark this set of samples as being different, the experiment ends.\n\nThe failure rate based on the above criteria was 8%. We ensured the quality of the annotations by paying bonuses based on time spent, not just number of HITs, and by disqualifying annotators if they annotated any sample (including those outside of the attention checks) more quickly than the combined length of the audio samples.\n\nWe then created two sets of labels for each noise-augmented clip. The first type of label compared a noise-augmented clip to its original. The noise-augmented clip was labeled the same if the modified and original clip were perceived to have the same valence or activation, otherwise it was labeled different. We created this label by taking the majority vote over all evaluations. The second type of label included valence and activation. A noise-augmented clip was given the average valence and activation over all evaluations.\n\nThe inter-annotator agreement was measured using Cohen's kappa. Conventionally, when estimating Cohen's kappa, annotators are not considered as individuals, instead reducing annotators to the generic 1, 2, and 3. The challenge is that this often leads to artificially inflated inter-annotator agreement because individual characteristics and behavior of a particular worker are not taken under consideration  [95] . We take a different approach, creating a table for the calculation of the statistic that considers annotators as individuals with separate entries for each clip, following the approach of  [95] . If an annotator didn't evaluate a given clip, the cell has a null (missing data) value. We found that the Cohen's kappa was 79% for activation and 76% for valence 6.",

This is important because the overwhelming majority of the noise-augmented utterances in the IEMOCAP dataset were not included in the user study and, therefore, do not have perceptual labels (Section 5.5).

Robustness evaluation when using perception-retaining samples, noise samples that do not change human perception 2. Robustness evaluation when using any kind of noise (i.e., both perception-retaining and perception-altering)\n\nWe perform robustness evaluation of a model by using the model's output predictions to create new noise-enhanced samples that change the model's output, compared to the original clean sample. We do this using an untargeted model misclassification test, in which we add noise to the samples. The intentional misclassification algorithm assumes black-box model access. For our purposes, it needs to have access to: (i) a subset of the dataset, (ii) noises to add to create perturbed samples, and (iii) model input and output.\n\nAs in any other perturbation-based robustness testing, the goal is to introduce perturbations to the samples such that the resulting samples are as close to the original sample as possible.\n\nThe minimally perturbed sample should be the one that causes a classifier to change its original classification. We measure the amount of perturbation using SNR, calculated using the logarithmic value of the ratio between the original signal and the noise-augmented signal's power. We note that the lower the decrease in SNR, the more minimally perturbed a sample is. The maximal decrease in SNR that we use in the algorithm is a difference of 10 dB. This condition ensures that the sample is not audibly judged as contaminated by humans  [119] .\n\nThe algorithm to choose this minimally perturbed sample has four major components:\n\n1.

Classifier output refers to the prediction made by the model when the attack algorithm sends an input to the model to be classified. Classifier output changes is true when the model predicted the emotion label differently after noise was added to the sample, compared to the original clean sample. Success implies that the algorithm was successfully able to force the model to misclassify a particular sample in the allowed number of attempts. Failure implies that the algorithm could not force the model to misclassify in the allowed number of attempts and that the model can be considered robust for that sample. We use the above algorithm in two different settings, under two different pre-known assumptions, with four levels of allowed queries, and four models (64 categories): For all the test samples, we execute five runs of the above algorithm to account for randomization in noise choices. These five runs are then averaged to obtain the average success of misclassification or average robustness for a given sample (1-average success of misclassification). We then average the robustness value over all the test samples. We report our obtained results for the above mentioned scenarios.

This ties into previous work  [37] , which looked into how changes and fluctuations in pitch levels influenced the perception of emotions.\n\nChanges in the speed of an utterance affect human perception of valence in 13% (average of -.13) of the cases when speed is increased, and 28% (average of -.23) when speed is decreased. On the other hand, changes in the speed of an utterance do not affect activation as often, specifically, 3% in case of increase and 6% in case of decrease.\n\nWe ensured that our crowsdourcing samples had an even distribution over gender of the speaker and the length of the sample (see Section 5.4.3). We performed paired t-test to evaluate whether these variables influenced the outcome of emotion perception change in presence of noise. We found that the changes in perception were not tied to characteristics of the speakers. For example, there was no correlation between changes in perception and variables such as, the original emotion of the utterance, the gender of the speaker, and the length of the utterance.\n\nThe human perception study provides insight into how emotion perception changes given noise. This also provides information about the potential effects of noise addition on model behavior. In the sections that follow, we will evaluate how machine perception changes given these sources of noise.",

      "text": "We first report results for only perception-retaining noises. When the training datasets are augmented with noise, we observe an average performance drop of 26% and 10% for matched noise conditions when using the traditional and the end-to-end deep learning model, respectively. For the mismatched noise conditions, we observe an average performance drop of 31% and 16% for the traditional and end-to-end deep learning models, respectively.\n\nBoth models see improved performance when the training dataset is augmented with continuous background noise in the matched noise setting. We find that data augmentation improves performance on mismatched noisy test data over a baseline system trained only on the clean IEMOCAP data. For example, the end-to-end model tested on environmental noise-augmented dataset (as compared to traditional deep learning model), reduces the performance drop to nearly zero. This improvement is particularly pronounced (an increase of 22% as compared to when trained on the clean partition) when the environmental noise is introduced at the start of the utterance (e.g., when the test set is introduced with nature-based noises at the start of the utterance and the train set is introduced with human and interior noises at the start of the utterance). We speculate that the network learns to assign different weights to the start and end of the utterance to account for the initial noise.\n\nHowever, we find that in both matched and mismatched conditions, it is hard to handle utterances contaminated with reverberation, a common use case, even when the training set is augmented with other types of noise. We find that this improvement in performance is even more reduced when using the wav2vec model, alluding to the model's fragility towards data integrity/structural changes. This can be because reverberation adds a continuous human speech signal in the background delayed by a small period of time. None of the other kind of noise types have speech in them, and hence augmentation doesn't aid the model to learn robustness to this kind of noise.\n\nFinally, we investigate the differences in model performance when we use all types of noise vs. those that are perception-retaining. Specifically, we focus on the perception-altering noises because samples augmented with noises in this category no longer have a known ground truth. We inquire as to whether the use of samples that alter perception may lead to the appearance of model performance improvement (note: appearance because the samples now have uncertain ground truth). To maintain equivalence, we ensure that the training and validation dataset sizes are equal even when they are augmented with more noise conditions. We observe that many cases of performance improvement occur when the noises include those that are perception-altering (see \"Al noises\" in Table  5 .2). We observe a difference of 12% to 25% between the numbers that we obtain for the perception-retaining noises vs.\n\nwhen not distinguishing between the two noise categories. This supports our claim that the choice between types of noises used for data augmentation during model training and performance evaluation affects the empirical observations and should be carefully considered.\n\nWe hypothesize that this improvement in performance may be due to the inherent nature of noises that change emotion perception, if they are perceptible enough to change emotion perception, then they may stand out enough that the model can adequately learn to separate them out and improve its prediction towards the original ground truth annotation. However, if the noise alteration truly does change perception, then the model is learning to ignore this natural human perceptual phenomenon. This may have negative consequences during model deployment.",

      "text": "In the matched training testing condition, we find that the traditional deep learning model has an average performance of 0.57 across all the datasets and testing setups, while the end-to-end models do substantially better at 0.61 UAR. See Table  5 .3 for details.\n\nIn the mismatched training testing condition, we find that for the traditional deep learning model, adding a denoising component to the models leads to a significant improvement when the original SNR is high (e.g., after continuous noise introduction the SNR decreases only by 10dB). In this case, we see an average improvement of 23% ± 3% across all environmental noise categories, compared to when there is no denoising or augmentation performed.\n\nHowever, when the SNR decreases by 20dB, we observe a decline in performance when using the noise suppression algorithms. We believe that this decline in performance is reflective of the mismatch in goals: the goal of noise suppression is to maintain, or improve, the comprehensibility of the speech itself, not necessarily highlight emotion. As a result, it may end up masking emotional information, as discussed in  [145] .\n\nWe further show that the addition of a denoising component does not significantly improve performance in the presence of signal distortion noise (other than reverberation) as compared to the presence of environmental noise (noise addition). For example, when samples were faded in or out or segments were sped up, the performance is significantly lower (-28%) than when tested on a clean test set. However, we did see an improvement in the performance for unseen reverberation contaminated samples as compared to data augmentation (an average of +36%). Finally, we observe a general trend of increase in emotion recognition performance for the combined dataset (noisy and non-noisy samples), as compared to when the model is trained on the clean training set, which supports the findings from previous dataset augmentation research  [10] .\n\nFor the end-to-end deep learning model, we use the noise-robust version. We find that the model is effective at countering environmental noise when trained on a dataset augmented with environmental noise, even in the mismatched condition. The performance is equivalent to the model evaluated on the clean data. We further delve into the amount of noise augmentation needed to achieve this equivalency. We consider all of the original training data. We augment a percentage of the training data, starting by augmenting a random sample of 10% with perception-retaining noise and increasing by 10% each time.\n\nWe find that we obtain equivalency after augmenting with only 30% of the training data.\n\nWe compare this compares to the traditional model, in which all of the training data are noise-augmented and we still do not see equivalency.\n\nWe separately consider the signal distortion noise samples. These were not part of the training of the wav2vec2-Large-robust model. However, this model only sees a 6% loss in performance, where the traditional robust model saw a 20% loss in performance.\n\nHowever, as discussed in the original traditional model, the end-to-end noise-robust model also fails on reverberation-based contamination even when trained on a similarly augmented dataset (note that the denoised traditional model could effectively handle reverberation). We believe that this may be because the wav2vec model is trained on continuous speech and relies on the underlying linguistic structure of speech. However, in reverberation, there is an implicit doubling of the underlying information, which is at odds with how this model was trained. This may explain why it is not able to compensate for this type of signal manipulation.\n\nNext, we analyze whether the perception category of noise used for data augmentation of the samples, in both, the train and test dataset influences the reported results for noise-robust model improvement. We find that there is a significant difference in performance when the testing dataset is augmented with any kind of noise vs. when augmented with perceptionretaining noise. Specifically, we observe that the maximal gains in performance when testing on matched noisy conditions are for samples for which we do not know whether or not the ground truth holds (i.e., both noise categories). For example, when using the noise robust traditional deep learning model, where the test and train dataset is augmented with any type of noises, we observe a performance improvement, as compared to that using a clean train dataset, of 12%. Similarly for noise robust end to end models, the performance improvement difference when using all noises vs. only perception retaining ones is 15% for activation and 13% for valence. Again, this is a problem when we think about deploying models in the real world because although the perception of these emotion expressions may change, we are assuming that the system should think of these perception labels as rigid and unchanging.",

We will show that if we are not careful with the selection of our noise types, moving from noise that we know not to alter perception to noise that may, the resulting noise sources can not only impact the brittleness of models, but also lead to inaccurate evaluation metrics. We also specifically report robustness performance when using reverberation-based contamination, as we observed that it is the most likely noise category to degrade the robustness of the model. We allow the decision boundary attack algorithm a maximum of five queries to create a noise augmented sample that will change the model output. We find that if the attacker is also given perception-altering noises, compared to perception-retaining, it can more effectively corrupt the sample. It achieves an increase in success rate from 35% (only perception-retaining) to 48.5% (all noise categories). This increase in the success rate when perception-altering noises are included implies that the model does not remain robust when the effects of noise on human perception are not considered.\n\nWe next consider the type of noise (environmental vs. signal manipulation). We find that the success rate of flipping a model's output is 18% for noises belonging to the environmental category, which is generally a category of perception-retaining noise. The success rate of flipping a model's output is 37% for all noises belonging to the signal manipulation category.\n\nWhen we constrain our possible noise choices to perception-retaining signal manipulations, we see that the success rate of the intentional misclassification algorithm drops to 24%. On the other hand, we observe that when we also consider the signal manipulations that are perception-altering, the success rate of flipping a model output is 39%. See Table  5 .4 for more details.\n\nWe previously discussed the fragility of end-to-end models towards reverberation-based noise contamination, noise that is perception-retaining for human evaluators. Here, we specifically run an experiment to use only that particular noise category for the model fragility testing. If the attacker knows that the model is susceptible to reverberation-based prediction changes, the intentional misclassification algorithm can land on an optimal set of room and reverberation parameters in a maximum of five queries to be able to produce a flipped output for that particular sample. It achieves a success rate of 24%, compared to 12% for other perception-retaining noises. The traditional noise-robust deep learning model is even more challenged, compared to the end-to-end model. The number of queries required to flip the output is three, vs. five for the end-to-end model, suggesting that it is less robust. This empirical evaluation is performed primarily to demonstrate how such noise inclusions can not only invalidate the ground truth but also lead to inaccurate and fragile benchmarking and evaluation of adversarial efficiency and robustness.",

For augmentation, we suggest that:\n\n1. Environmental noise should be added to datasets to improve generalizability to varied noise conditions, whether using denoising, augmentation, or a combination of both.\n\n2. It is good to augment datasets by fading the loudness of the segments, dropping letters or words, and speeding up small (no more than 25% of the total sample length) segments of the complete sound samples in the dataset. But it is important to note that these augmented samples should not be passed through the denoising component as the denoised version loses emotion information.\n\n3. One should not change the speed of the entire utterance more than 5% and should not add intentional pauses or any background noises that elicit emotion behavior, e.g., sobs or laughter.\n\nRegarding deployment, we suggest that:\n\n1. Noisy starts and ends of utterances can be handled by augmentation, hence, if the training set included these augmentations, there should be no issue for deployed emotion recognition systems.\n\n2. Reverberation is hard to handle for even augmented emotion recognition models.\n\nHence, the samples must either be cleaned to remove the reverberation effect, or must be identified as low confidence for classification.\n\n3.

      "text": "Emotion technologies, both recognition and synthesis, are heavily dependent on having reliably annotated emotional data, annotations that describe the observed emotional display.\n\nThe hope is often that these annotations capture the speaker's true underlying state. Yet, in practice, this true felt sense emotion is unknown, and researchers must resort to manual labeling of data. The hope is that these manual labels are sufficiently \"correct\" to enable the training and evaluation of emotion technologies. One method of ensuring quality labels has been to require the participation of expert raters. However, it can be both expensive and time consuming to hire expert raters. More recently, researchers have embraced crowdsourcing services (e.g., Amazon Mechanical Turk) to efficiently collect annotations from non-expert workers in a cost-effective and timely manner  [201] . Once collected, annotations from non-expert workers are aggregated to form ground-truth labels that are used for training and evaluating automated systems. However, the method through which these annotations are collected can profoundly impact the behavior of the annotators. In this chapter, we study how the setup of a crowdsourcing task can influence both the collected emotion labels as well as the performance of classifiers trained using these labels.\n\nThe effective use of crowdsourcing for collecting reliable emotion labels has been an active research topic. Burmania et al. investigated the trade-off between the number of annotators and underlying reliability of the annotations  [33] . Other work has looked at quality-control techniques to improve the reliability of annotations. For example, Soleymani et al. used qualification tests to filter out spammers and retain high-quality annotators  [201] .\n\nBurmania et al. investigated the use of gold-standard samples to monitor annotators' reliability and fatigue  [35] .\n\nHowever, variability also results from context, relevant past information that provides cues as to how to interpret an emotional display. Context, such as tone, words, expressions can affect how individuals perceive emotion  [129] . Context is also implicitly included in the labeling schemes of many of the most common emotion datasets (e.g., IEMOCAP  [36]  and MSP-Improv  [38] ) because annotators rate each utterance (or time period) in order.\n\nThat means that annotators are influenced by information that they recently observed  [233] .\n\nHowever, emotion recognition systems are often trained over single utterances  [10, 3, 157, 190] , leading to a mismatch in the information available to annotators and to classification systems.\n\nIn this work, we study the difference between annotations obtained for audio clips when emotional displays are presented to annotators with context and when presented randomly. In both cases, annotators are affected by the emotion displays that they have recently observed  [180, 188] . However, only in the contextual presentation there is also a cohesive story. We investigate the following research questions:\n\n• Q1: Is there a significant difference between annotations obtained from random and contextual presentations?\n\n• Q2: Are annotations obtained from contextual presentations more similar to a speaker's own self-reported labels than those from random presentations?\n\n• Q3: Is there a significant difference between the inter-rater agreements obtained from random and contextual presentations?\n\n• Q4: How does the performance of an emotion recognition system, operating on single utterances, vary given annotations obtained from random and contextual presentations?\n\n• Q5: How does the performance gain of an emotion recognition system operating across multiple utterances vary given different amounts of context (defined as number of prior utterances) and labels obtained from random and contextual presentations?\n\nThe findings from this work will provide insight into performance implications of emotion recognition system given mismatches between the amount of context provided to the annotators generating the labels and the ultimate classification system.\n\nThe main aim of the work was to annotate the dataset described in the previous chapter.\n\nFor all further experiments, we use the utterances created from the MuSE dataset.",

HITs were defined as sets of utterances in either the contextual or random presentation condition. In each condition, workers were presented with a single utterances and were asked to annotate the activation and valence values of that utterance using Self Assessment Manikins  [30] . Once completed, the worker was presented with a new HIT and could not go back to revise a previous estimate of emotion. This annotation strategy is different than the one deployed in  [48] ,where the workers could go back and re-evaluate utterances.\n\nIn the randomized experiment, each HIT is an utterance from any section, by any speaker, from any session and all HITs appear in random order. So, a worker might see the first HIT as Utterance 10 from Section 3 of Subject 4's stressed recording and see the second HIT as Utterance 1 from Section 5 of Subject 10's non-stressed recording. This setup ensured that the workers couldn't condition to any speaker's specific style or contextual information.\n\nIn the contextual experiment, we posted each HIT as a collection of ordered utterances from a section of a particular subject's recording. Because each section's question was designed to elicit a particular emotion, we still posted the HITs in a random order over sections from all subjects. This prevented workers from conditioning to the speaking style of an individual participant. For example, a worker might see the first HIT as Utterance 1...N from Section 3 of Subject 4's stressed recording and see the second HIT as Utterance 1...M from Section 5 of Subject 10's non-stressed recording where N, M are the number of utterances in those sections respectively. We recruited from a population of workers in the United States who are native English speakers, to reduce the impact of cultural variability. We ensured that each worker had > 98% approval rating and number of HITs approved as > 500.

Prior work has shown context effects emotion perception  [233] , even when observers are explicitly asked not to take it under consideration  [165, 43] . Hence, we believe that context provided by previous utterances would lead to a change in perception of a particular utterance. Tables 6.1 and 6.2 (sets of significantly different means are bolded (𝑡-test, 𝑝 < 0.01)) show the mean activation and valence, for the random and contextualized labeling schemes, grouped by condition and question, respectively. Table  6 .1 shows that, for non-stress conditions, the mean of the activation ratings obtained through contextual labeling is significantly higher than that obtained through random labeling. The table also shows that, for both stress and non-stress conditions, the valence means obtained through contextual labeling are significantly higher than those obtained through random labeling. Table  6 .2 shows that, although the mean valence and activation values were consistently different for the labelling schemes across all emotion elicitation techniques, the differences were significant in some elicitation techniques and not in others. Hypothesis: Annotations of outside observers are more similar to self-annotations in the contextual case, compared to the randomized case. Path models  [17]  suggest that subjective voice variation, from the established mental baseline accounts for much of the variance in emotion inference. Hence, emotion inference is aided with more cues about the speech patterns that are more readily provided through context. Figure  6 .1 shows the absolute differences between the mean crowdsourced labels (valence and activation, each for random and contextual schemes) and self-reported scores as a function of utterance position. The figure shows that contextual labels have consistently lower absolute differences, compared to self-reported labels, than the random labels. A paired 𝑡-test shows that these differences between the contextual and random labels are significant (𝑝 < 0.01) for both valence and activation.\n\nOur results suggest that crowdsourced emotion labels collected with access to contextual information are closer to self-reported emotion labels.

In this work, we study how the multimodal expressions of emotion change when an individual is under varying levels of stress. We hypothesize that stress produces modulations that can hide the true underlying emotions of individuals and that we can make emotion recognition algorithms more generalizable by controlling for variations in stress. To this end, we use adversarial networks to decorrelate stress modulations from emotion representations. We study how stress alters acoustic and lexical emotional predictions, paying special attention to how modulations due to stress affect the transferability of learned emotion recognition models across domains. Our results show that stress is indeed encoded in trained emotion classifiers and that this encoding varies across levels of emotions and across the lexical and acoustic modalities. Our results also show that emotion recognition models that control for stress during training have better generalizability when applied to new domains, compared to models that do not control for stress during training. We conclude that is is necessary to consider the effect of extraneous psychological factors when building and testing emotion recognition models.",

      "text": "Many extraneous psychological factors influence how individuals express and perceive emotions  [171] . However, most emotion recognition algorithms, rely on data collected in controlled laboratory environments (e.g.,  [36, 38] ) where influences from such factors are either not present, or kept constant. The performance of emotion recognition algorithms is likely to vary when applied to data where these external psychological factors are present.\n\nIn this work, we study how an extraneous psychological factor, stress, affects multimodal (acoustic+lexical) emotion classifiers. Stress can affect how individuals produce and perceive emotion  [171] . Yet, the effect of stress levels on the performance of state-of-the-art emotion recognition systems has not been explored.\n\nExtraneous psychological factors can act as confounding factors, variables that influence both the output (e.g., emotion) and the input (e.g., acoustic and lexical features). Not controlling for confounding variables when training emotion classifiers can cause the classifiers to learn unintentional associations between the variables, associations that might not replicate in real world scenarios. For instance, consider a dataset where all the \"sad\" samples were unintentionally recorded from individuals who were experiencing stress at the time of recording. Not taking special care when building the models could cause a trained classifier to erroneously associate experiencing stress with being sad. In this work, we study how stress alters the performance of trained emotional classifiers in the context of neural networks. We then see how performance is affected when tested on samples out of domain, when we explicitly impede the network from learning such associations.\n\nPrevious research showed that controlling for confounding variables when training emotion recognition classifiers results in more robust models when compared to models trained without controlling for the same confounding variables. For instance, Abdelwahab et al.  [4]  and Gideon et al.  [83]  showed that controlling for domain (i.e., data source), as a confounding factor, when training emotion recognition models results in improved cross-corpus generalization performance when compared to performance of models that were trained without controlling for domain as a confounding factor. Most of the above mentioned methods rely on samples obtained from the target domain to extract representations that retain information only about emotion and not domains. Our goal is to go beyond studying the effects of variations due to domain and background noise on the robustness of trained emotion recognition models, and instead focus on how stress affects the learned acoustic and lexical emotional representations. Unlike the commonly used methods for learning domain invariance, we aim to accomplish generalizing person specific behavior by proactively \"unlearning\" the modulations due to the presence of stress while still retaining emotion information in representations.\n\nIn particular, we seek to answer the following questions:\n\n1. Can we recognize stress given representations trained solely for recognizing emotion?\n\nIs the stress recognition performance similar across the lexical and acoustic modalities?\n\n2. Can we completely decorrelate emotion representations from stress representations?\n\nIf so, how does this decorrelation impact the performance of emotion classifiers?  To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work that studies the interplay between emotion and stress in the context of automatic emotion recognition and representation learning.",

For instance, Zhang et al.  [149]  showed that the performance of detecting sarcasm decreases when controlling for publication as a confounding variable in the training process, but the prediction accuracy increases on an unseen publication set. Similarly, Ganin et al.  [79]  showed that controlling for domain while training a network for detecting sentiment can result in a performance reduction on the main task. The reduction in performance on the main task, after controlling for an extraneous confounding variable, can be attributed to the removal of information that the model can use as a \"shortcut\" for achieving the main task.\n\nOur results show that (Tables 7.1a and 7.1b):\n\n• Activation classification performance decreases given adversarial training. This decrease is statistically significant for the acoustic (6.382% drop in UAR) and multimodal (6.980% drop in UAR) setups.\n\n• Valence classification performance decreases given adversarial training. This decrease is statistically significant for the multimodal setup (3.754% drop).\n\nThe reduction in performance in the main task after controlling for a confounding variable can also be caused by the removal of information that is equally beneficial for both detecting stress and detecting emotion. Our results in further sections , however, show that models that control for stress are better able to recognize emotion in new domains, compared to models that do not control for stress. This suggests that the process of \"unlearning\" stress does not come at the expense of the primary task of emotion detection.",

Hence we believe that removing modulations due to stress should aid the generalizability of the model to datasets, where this psychological factor is either unmeasured or the distribution is non-uniform between training and testing.\n\nTo answer if the models trained on MuSE dataset generalize better, we perform two sets of experiments: (a) self generalizability in artificially partitioned datasets with different stress distributions for evidence of concept and (b) cross-dataset generalizability.\n\nArtificially Segmented Within-Dataset Performance. We run the first set of experiments by creating partitions of data by stress level. We do this to create artificially mismatched environments between training and testing. We reserve one set to be test set (target), while keeping the other two for training and validation combined (source). This is in similar vein to partitioning created across confounding factor for UCI Bike Rentals Dataset in  [209] . To ensure speaker independent sets, we divide the training set using an 80:20 split (train and validation), ensuring no speakers overlap. We run these models 𝑛 times where 𝑛 is the number of speakers in test data, that are also present in train/validation data. For each run, we remove one speaker from the train/validation data and test on that speaker. We calculate the average test performance of all these runs as the performance of the model for that setup.\n\nWe report our results in Table  7 .3. When we consider low levels of stress as our target, we see that adversarial classification significantly improves performance over normal classification for multimodal setup for activation and for both, lexical and multimodal setup for valence. Considering mid levels of stress as our target, adversarial classification significantly improves performance over normal classification for all setups for activation and for both, acoustic and multimodal setup for valence. Subsequently considering high levels of stress as our target, adversarial classification significantly improves performance over normal classification for acoustic setups for activation and for all setups for valence.\n\nCross-dataset Performance. Now that we have evidence for concept for artificially • Valence: There is a significant increase in performance using acoustic setup (0.376 vs 0.401) and multimodal setup (0.431 vs 0.472) of adversarial model when tested on IEMOCAP.

Now, we want to see if the same method can be used to make models trained using other datasets more reliable to change in target data distribution. We hypothesize that decorrelating the effect of spontaneity on emotion representation will lead to models that generalize better. This is because, as shown in  [146] , the emotional content expression is different in scripted vs spontaneous speech, and hence should modulate the emotion representation in trained model. To this end, we use the IEMOCAP dataset which has utterances that come from sessions that are both scripted and improvised. We do not use MSP-Improv for similar analysis here, because the scripted sessions, by corpus design, have limited lexical content and hence wouldn't cover enough input representation space for generalizability.

We perform this assessment for both the activation and valence normal and adversarial lexical models. We focus on the cross-dataset case in which the models were trained on MuSE and tested on IEMOCAP (in Table  7 .6). A large positive correlation between a category and APS implies that samples with larger numbers of words in a given category are likely to be classified correctly more often given the adversarial model versus the normal model.\n\n• Activation recognition: APS is significantly positively correlated with the presence of words that relate to: Adverb (0.217), pronoun (0.165), positive emotion (0.154), certainity (0.138), fillers (0.154), discourse markers (0.141), and content rate (0.196).\n\n• Valence recognition: APS is significantly positively correlated with the presence of words that relate to: Adverb (0.177), negative emotion (0.143), fillers (0.182), content rate (0.178).\n\nThis finding is consistent with previous research  [151] , where the authors have shown that there is often an increase in usage of function words and intensifiers in stressed conditions.\n\nSo, for example a sentence \"I am really really sad about losing my pen\" would have more likelihood of being correctly classified by the adversarial model compared to the normal emotion classification model. Hence, we can hypothesise that an increase in the likelihood of correct classification of samples containing these intensifiers occurs due to reduced weightage of adverbs in adversarial training paradigm.\n\nThere are fewer significant categories for valence than for activation. This is consistent with the results in Table  7 .4 for the lexical modality. Although we see a significant correlation between filler words and APS for activation classification  [65] , we do not observe the same for discourse markers and presence of social process words. The absence of significance in these cases implies that though these values are markers of stress, the normal classifier is still able to learn reliable representations invariant of stress for predicting the correct target label, resulting in negligible impact on classification performance when decorrelating the representations.\n\nDecorrelating Spontatenity. We do a similar analysis for analyzing lexical properties of samples that were aided by decorrelating spontaneity. We report the Pearson correlation coefficient and the resulting Benjamini-Hochberg adjusted  [25]  𝑝-values that we obtain from the LIWC features and APS for both emotion axes lexical-based classification models (trained on IEMOCAP; tested on MuSE) in Table  7 .7.\n\n• Activation recognition: APS is significantly positively correlated with the presence of • Valence recognition: APS is significantly positively correlated with the presence of words that relate to: Social Process (0.166), positive (0.161) and negative (0.148) emotion, certainty (0.172), and content rate (0.144).\n\nThe results suggest that there are identifiable linguistic properties of samples whose likelihood of correct classification benefits from the model trained adversarially to decorrelate spontaneity and emotion representation as compared to normal classification model. This is especially true for the use of words in the certainty category for both emotion dimensions and all hesitation categories for activation. Spontaneous speech has been shown to have more of these words in  [53] . Scripted content has been shown to have more exaggerated displays of emotion through words and facial expressions  [113] . Controlling for the weights assigned to words in positive and negative emotion categories using the adversarial model, leads to better classification of samples that are comprised of these word tokens.",

      "text": "The rise of mobile applications and conversational agents harnessing emotion recognition capabilities has brought a crucial challenge to the forefront: the safeguarding of sensitive user information. This data, encapsulating detailed demographic aspects, is often extracted from user devices and stored on centralized servers. In worst-case scenarios, these details could be exploited without user consent or manipulated by harmful entities. Storing abstracted representations rather than raw data, while a potential solution, doesn't fully counter the problem. Indeed, these representations, intended for tasks like emotion recognition, are susceptible to inadvertent demographic leakage undermining user-defined settings (for example, to not receive gender targetted ads) and exposing sensitive variables from unimodal (textual or acoustic) or multimodal data.\n\nThe consequences of unintentional demographic leakage are significant. Continual exposure of sensitive attributes threatens the integrity of user data. Moreover, the inherent tie-in of demographics such as age, gender, and race with emotion recognition models makes these models potential reservoirs of sensitive user information-even when storing only representational data. As a result, measures to counter demographic leakage have become a and to gain access to sensitive information. A way to counter this issue in data collected by mobile or smart home applications is to generate a data representation on the device and then to transfer that representation to the server for additional processing. The benefit is that these representations can decrease leakage of content and sensitive information by partially obfuscating the actual content of the conversation  [24] . However, they still contain sensitive demographic information.\n\nThe implications of sensitive information leakage is profound: research has shown that discrimination occurs across variables of age, race, and gender in hiring, policing and credit ratings  [92] .  [2]  showed how adding random noise to aggregated dataset or individual samples can ensure defense against attacks that aim to classify sensitive information from the representation. But, previous research has shown that using additional noise can often be exploited if the adversary has access to the network used to generate anonymity  [120] .\n\nTherefore to ensure robustness, we consider a scenario of the attacker having access to the same embedding sub-network to generate the representations that will be used to train its attack network.\n\nIn this work, we focus on sensitive information encoding in the context of emotion recognition. Emotion recognition provides an important test case because emotion production varies significantly across gender and race. As a result, the outputs of emotion recognition models are often highly correlated with these secondary demographic signals  [45, 202] . We design approaches to first measure leakage and then to counteract this leakage. We measure sensitive information encoding in two ways: 1) using a sensitive information reduction metric, which we define as the incapability of an attacker to recover demographic information from representations, and 2) by determining an adversary's ability to perform membership identification  [136] , defined as the ability to determine if a given user was in a dataset from which the emotion recognition models were trained (this can be harmful if the training data are collected in a sensitive context, such as counselling or therapy). We ask the following seven questions:\n\n1. Does demographic leakage differ in umimodal and multimodal emotion recognition models?\n\n2. How does the sensitive information reduction metric change when a network is trained to not encode sensitive information?\n\n3. How does emotion recognition performance change when networks are trained to not encode sensitive information?\n\n4. How does the adversarial component's strength impact emotion recognition performance and the sensitive information reduction metric?\n\n5. Focusing on gender, how does the performance of emotion recognition change when a network is trained to not encode sensitive information?\n\n6. Does the location of the adversarial component within a network affect the sensitive information reduction metric and emotion recognition performance?\n\n7. Does the sensitive information reduction paradigm that we used to reduce encoding of gender information also help defend against other attacks such as membership identification?\n\nOur results show that representations obtained for emotion recognition can be exploited by an adversary to predict sensitive variables given unimodal information (either audio or lexical). We further show that multimodal models contain even more sensitive information, as lexical and audio each encode different aspects of demographic information. We show that we can increase the defense against this attack by adversarially training representations to be invariant to gender. The novelty of this work is two fold:  (1)  we analyze how the demographic variable encoded in a representation differs across modalities and how it can be increased using adversarial paradigm; and, (2) we obtain enhanced representations that defend against multiple sensitive information leakage or prediction attacks while still maintaining performance on emotion recognition.\n\nGiven most of the previous work on representations that aim to reduce encoded sensitive information concentrates on just lexical information, we tackle the questions that arise from desiring such preservation in multimodal representations for emotion recognition. While the primary goal of most previous works has been to avoid unintentional inference by the application itself, we concentrate on minimizing the potency of an attacker to deliberately recover sensitive attributes from an invariant representation.",

The main network consists of three components: (1) embedding sub-network, 𝑀𝑜𝑑𝑒𝑙(𝜃); (2) emotion classifier, 𝜃 𝑐 and output 𝑦 𝑖 ; and (3) gender classifier, 𝐷 𝑖 (𝜃 𝑑 𝑖 ), with output, 𝑏 𝑖 . We then disucss how an attacker network could maliciously use this information to obtain sensitive demographic information.\n\nMain Network. The embedding sub-network uses a state-of-the-art multimodal approach in emotion recognition  [9]  in which the acoustic and lexical information are processed separately and then joined after the application of modality-specific global mean pooling.\n\nThe acoustic input stream (𝑥 𝑖 (𝑎)), where 𝑖 represents an input frame (40-dimensional) and 𝑎 represents acoustic, is processed using a set of convolution layers and Gated Recurrent Units (GRU), which are fed through a mean pooling layer to produce an acoustic representation (ℎ 𝑎 ). The lexical input (𝑥 𝑖 (𝑙)), where 𝑖 represents an input word (300-dimensional) and 𝑙 represents lexical, is passed through GRUs and pooled to obtain a lexical representation (ℎ 𝑙 ). For the multimodal setup, these two representations, (ℎ 𝑎 ) and (ℎ 𝑙 ), are concatenated (ℎ). The representations (ℎ, ℎ 𝑎 , ℎ 𝑙 ) are of fixed-length given acoustic and lexical inputs. The emotion classifier takes in the representation (ℎ, ℎ 𝑎 , or ℎ 𝑙 ) as input and estimates valence or activation using a set of dense layers. The gender classifier estimates the gender label (i.e., male or female) using a set of dense layers.\n\nGender-Leakage. The main network is trained to unlearn gender. To achieve this goal, we use a Gradient Reversal Layer (GRL)  [77] . GRLs are a common multi-task approach to train networks such that they are invariant to specific properties  [153, 107] . During the backward pass of the training phase, the GRL multiplies the backpropogated gradients by -𝜆 (i.e., the strength of the adversarial component). During the forward pass, the GRL acts as an identity function. To make the network invairant to gender, we place the GRL function between the embedding sub-network and the gender classifier. We obtain gender-invariant representations using the following loss function: where 𝑁 is the number of targeted sensitive variables (here 𝑁=1). The loss function ensures that while the output components are trained to be good predictors, the representation is trained to be maximally good for the primary task (emotion) and maximally poor for the secondary task (gender).\n\nAttacker Network. We assume that the attacker has access to a held-out dataset (either a different dataset or a section of the original dataset) with known gender labels. The attacker generates representations for this dataset using the previously described embedding subnetwork. The network then learns to predict gender labels from the generated representations using a set of dense layers. Since the parameters used to construct the representation are fixed, the attacker only acts upon its own parameters to optimize the gender prediction linear loss.\n\nThe purpose of the attacker's network is to recover gender information from representations whose labels are unknown. Though testing using a singular network isn't a guarantee of robustness of the representation to attacks that aim to predict or extract sensitive information from representations, for the scope of this chapter, we use a feed forward network, one of the powerful learning methods on a fixed size static representation. Training. We implement models using the Keras library.  [52] . We use a weighted cross-entropy loss function for each task and learn the model parameters using the RMSProp optimizer.  [214] .

We measure performance using UAR (chance is 0.33).\n\nDemographic Leakage. Leakage is defined as the ability of a trained gender classifier to predict gender from the representations which are obtained when the network is simultaneously trained to perform the primary task.\n\nDemographic Sensitive Information Reduction Metric. We define the sensitive information reduction metric as the inability of an attacker to be able to recover gender from the representations trained on a primary task. To test this, we use four phases of training.\n\n1. We train the main network on a dataset (D1), represented by the pair (𝑥 𝐷1 , 𝑦 𝐷1 ), where 𝑥 is the data input while 𝑦 is the gender label. We obtain representations for this dataset (ℎ(𝑥 𝐷1 )).\n\n2. We consider that the attacker has access to another dataset or unused subset of the same dataset (D2) represented by the pair (𝑥 𝐷2 , 𝑦 𝐷2 ). We generate representations ℎ(𝑥 𝐷2 )\n\nfor the pairs in this dataset using the embedding sub-network of the main network.\n\n3. We train a model (𝑀 𝑎𝑡𝑡 ) to predict gender labels using the representations obtained in step 2, represented as 𝑀 𝑎𝑡𝑡 ((ℎ(𝑥 𝐷2 ), 𝑦 𝐷2 )).\n\n4. Using the model obtained previously (𝑀 𝑎𝑡𝑡 ), we choose ℎ(𝑥 𝐷1 ) as inputs, and measure the gender prediction capability of the attacker 𝑈 𝐴𝑅(𝑀 𝑎𝑡𝑡 ((ℎ(𝑥 𝐷1 ), 𝑦 𝐷1 )). The Demographic Sensitive Information Reduction metric of an attacker is then quantitatively defined as 1 -𝑈 𝐴𝑅(𝑀 𝑎𝑡𝑡 ).\n\nThe range of the sensitive information reduction metric goes from 0 (the attacker is always correct) to 0.5 (the attacker has a chance UAR).\n\nMembership Identification. Membership identification is the possibility of an attacker being able to recognize if a speaker belongs to the training set. We assume that the adversary can obtain samples from a speaker from the same distribution as that for the training set.\n\nConsider that the adversary knows some speakers for whom representations definitely exist in the training set and some for whom they definitely don't. We test the possibility of membership identification using four steps:\n\n1. We simulate the above using cross-validation. Given five speaker independent folds, we use three for the training set. From the remaining two folds, we add some samples of the selected speakers to the training set.\n\n2. We consider that the attacker knows both, the speakers selected and not selected for training from set four (𝑠4), but has no information about this split for set five (𝑠5). The objective of the attacker is to predict whether speakers were selected for inclusion in • A network trained to only recognize emotion is generally discriminative for gender as well. For instance we obtain a leakage of 0.73 when training a multi-modal network for activation and of 0.64 when trained for valence on MuSE.\n\n• In unimodal systems, leakage is higher when systems are trained using only audio streams compared to lexical.\n\n• Leakage of gender in learned representation is higher for multimodal systems than that for the unimodal systems for both, MuSE and IEMOCAP (the two datasets with both audio and lexical information).\n\nOur results suggest that models that aren't explicitly trained for gender recognition, or, that don't use gender as an input feature, still learn representations that are discriminative to identify gender. This leakage is more prominent when the input stream is audio as compared to lexical, but the leakage compounds in multimodal systems.",

Previous research  [67]  has also shown that while the representations might be trained such that leakage of sensitive variable is reduced to chance, the attacker might still be able to recover this information.

We analyze the effect of the strength of the adversarial component on the performance of the primary task and the sensitive information reduction metric.\n\nWe find that the emotion recognition performance is generally unaffected with a change in 𝜆, as expected from the results in Section 8.4.3. We observe that the the attacker is usually less capable of inferring gender from learned representations when 𝜆 = 0.50 as compared to when 𝜆 = 0.75. For example, the sensitive information reduction metric for the unimodal audio system trained on MuSE increases from 0.39 to 0.45. But contrary to our expectation, we often see a decrease in the sensitive information reduction metric when we move from 𝜆 = 0.75 to 𝜆 = 1.00 for both activation and valence.

[168]  showed that removing identifying factors from learned representations reduces the probability of membership leakage. For this analysis, we ask two questions: (a) can we defend against membership identification using a proxy task and, (b) can we defend against both, gender and membership identification?\n\nWe train an attack model for membership identification as specified in Section 8.3.2. We find that while adversarial removal of gender in the learned representation (Act: Table  8 .1a\n\nand Val: Table  8 .1b) does lead to reduced membership identification, as compared to a model trained solely for emotion recognition (Act: Table  8 .1a and Val: Table  8 .1b), the membership identification is still far higher than chance.\n\nOur goal is to be unable to identify whether samples from speaker 'x' exist in the training set. This is different from the usual membership defense that prevents prediction of presence of a data-point pair (𝑖𝑛𝑝𝑢𝑡 𝑥 , 𝑜𝑢𝑡 𝑝𝑢𝑡 𝑥 ) is in the training set. As a result, we require a proxy task, because our model cannot use samples from the speakers not in the training set even to induce invariance. We hypothesize that given randomly chosen speakers from the population, speaker-invariant training leads to representations that are less likely to encode speaker-specific information. This will make it harder for the attacker to identify membership of a particular speaker in the training set.

This provides a compelling case for separating the process of data processing on user devices and of task-specific training on central servers. While in this chapter we concentrate on a single primary task i.e., emotion recognition, this method can be extended to maximize utility on multiple primary tasks that are loosely related to each other and are benefited from a multi-task setup as shown for dialogue act and turn detection, and sentiment and topic classification  [187] .\n\nWe propose model-agnostic evaluation templates can be instantiated with sociological word lists, and these templates can be generalized to any task with existing word lists. We introduce two metrics: one for emotion generalization and another for intentional reduction of learnt sensitive information. These metrics aim to comprehensively assess model performance, while reducing dependency on expensive human-based feedback. By effectively evaluating the robustness and sensitive variable leakage of models, the proposed metrics provide valuable insights into model performance, resulting in more efficient utilization of resources.\n\nEvaluating their effectiveness in enhancing model performance and reducing leakage of sensitive demographic, we find that these metrics are significantly correlated with model performance and can improve cross-corpus results. The proposed method empowers us to leverage the benefits of diverse and comprehensive emotion recognition models, while mitigating the costs associated with the traditional, labor-intensive feedback processes.\n\nUltimately, this approach leads to the development of more accurate and relevant emotion recognition models in a cost-effective manner.",

      "text": "Recent advances in natural language processing have led to the development of large and very large language models that can be trained on massive amounts of labeled data.\n\nHowever, despite their impressive performance on various natural language processing tasks, these models do not necessarily learn behavior that is similar to that of humans. Data diversity is particularly important in subjective, paralinguistic tasks, such as those seen in emotion recognition and other behavior modeling areas. But paralinguistic datasets are often relatively small, compared to the size of datasets seen in fields such as speech recognition.\n\nFurther, it can be difficult to identify appropriate metrics for these subjective tasks and, as a result, those common in emotion recognition tend to be metrics such as cross-entropy loss between the predicted and original labels.\n\nThe challenge with the common metrics is that they do not capture the full complexity of the problem, leading to models that have limitations at their core. Models trained to optimize for cross-entropy are often suffused with biases. Reducing learnt sensitive information or generalizing these models can be extremely difficult because sensitive information reduction processes generally rely on these same data and labels. Therefore, limitations in the original dataset are still present when the model attempts to unlearn these problematic associations  [192, 81] .\n\nResearchers have looked at countering these issues in several different ways: from data generation, to data augmentation, and, from annotation diversification to comprehensive data collection  [46] . Each of these methods comes with its own pros and cons. For example, generating data samples that are not perceived differently by humans is not only challenging, but also, requires extensive post-hoc evaluations  [109] . Researchers have also looked at diverse data collection methods, focusing on active learning optimizing for data diversity  [182] . While this method generally improves performance by a significant measure, we can still end up with datasets that reinforce unwanted stereotypes and prejudices  [49] .\n\nThis has led to a growing need for feedback that is based on human evaluation to ensure that the models produce more accurate and relevant results. One of the main challenges of using human-based feedback though is that it can be expensive to obtain, particularly for tasks that involve emotions. This is because emotions are subjective and can vary widely depending on demographic and situational factors. As a result, there is a need for alternative methods that can provide metrics for evaluating the performance of language models that are centered around human behavior.\n\nTo address this issue, we propose leveraging metrics that are based on sociological literature, which can capture the nuances of human behavior and emotions. By drawing on insights from sociology, we can develop more nuanced and context-sensitive metrics that can better capture the complexities of human behavior. This approach has the potential to provide a more comprehensive optimization of language models, while also reducing the dependence on expensive and time-consuming human-based feedback.",

      "text": "In this chapter, we propose a novel approach to developing task-invariant metric templates that are centered around human perception. To begin with, we define metric blueprints, called as metric templates. These templated metrics that have generic components that can be adapted for specific tasks. Our aim is to leverage these templates to evaluate a model, and to add a training objective that relies on sociological literature in addition to human-obtained labels. This is a significant departure from the traditional approach of using labeled data, which can be costly and time-consuming to obtain.\n\nIdeally, important words identified by models should align well with human's interpretations. To achieve this, we use model interpretability; any method that provides us some intuition as to the words that the model pays attention to for its prediction to define the metric templates. This allows us to have a training objective that optimizes for importance assigned to certain words based on sociolinguistic literature. This approach is different from using labels because it enables us to incorporate sociolinguistic knowledge into the metric templates.\n\nThe metric templates we propose consist of three components: directionality (sign), input interpretation saliency weights, and word lists. The combination of the three components results in a task-invariant metric template.\n\nThe sign component specifies whether the metric is meant to be maximized or minimized.\n\nBy setting the sign, we can control the direction of the correlational relationship between the input and output variables, and thus, improve the accuracy of our predictions.\n\nThe input interpretation saliency weights component specifies how the input data should be interpreted. They are saliency values obtained from the model for each word token in the input. These values are highly correlated with the predicted label and can be positive, negative, or zero. A positive value indicates that the presence of a word correlates with the prediction of that label. A negative value indicates that the presence of that word correlates with \"not predicting the given label.\" A zero value means that the word has no influence on the prediction.\n\nThe wordlists component provides a list of words that should be given special consideration when computing the metric. These lists can be grouped by class labels and may have associated weights with each word, but both of these features are optional. Wordlists are an essential tool for training machine learning models, as they allow us to focus on specific words or concepts that are relevant to our task. By using wordlists, we can improve the accuracy and efficiency of our models, as well as gain valuable insights into the relationships between words and concepts in our data.\n\nIn summary, our metric template allows us to focus on three separate aspects, each aligned with one of the components. Sign allows us to encourage the model to learn the correlation between a particular word and the output (sign of loss function). The input interpretation saliency weights allow us to measure how well the model captures the correlation between all words in a sentence and the output. The wordlists allow us to impact the learned correlations to align with our expectations about the relationshp between a given category and word choice.\n\nWe now ground these aspects, focusing on a given task-related wordlist focusing on the task of emotion recognition. For our purposes, we use the NRC-VAD  [159]  and a self curated, Emotion-Gender wordlists. We first calculate the overlap between the words in the input sentence and the task-related wordlist(s). This overlap allows us to identify words whose correlations (learned by a model) may need to change. For class-based wordlists, we use the signed correlation that corresponds to the predicted class label, which is controlled by the sign component of our metric template. By setting the sign, we can encourage the model to learn the correlation between a particular word and the output. In cases where we want to unlearn a task completely, we aim to move the correlation of those words to zero to remove any influence on the model output. The input interpretation saliency weights component of our metric template specifies how well the model captures the correlation between all words in a sentence and the output. By leveraging the overlap between task-related words and the input sentence, we can effectively optimize the correlations and improve the model's performance. Our proposed metric is designed to help models learn the correlations that are relevant to the task at hand while minimizing the impact of irrelevant words. By using the metric template, we can focus on three separate aspects, each aligned with one of the components: sign, iiw, and wordlists, allowing us to impact the learned correlations to align with our expectations about the relationship between a given category and word choice.\n\nThe focus of this chapter is on the extensive testing of a metric template designed for the task of emotion recognition. We had the option to choose between task coverage or usability. Task coverage involves testing multiple tasks on a single state-of-the-art (SoTA) dataset and model, while usability involves extensively evaluating the proposed metric for one subjective task of emotion, but testing it on multiple datasets and different model combinations. We chose the latter approach to validate the usability of the metric rather than the task coverage. Our approach involves selecting one task for learning, which is emotion, and one subtask for unlearning, which is demographics. Through this chapter, we iterate over various combinations of this setup, thoroughly validating the utility of the metric for both cases, including emotion classification improvement and reducing encoded sensitive information in emotion classification models, while varying the datasets and other factors.\n\nOur results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed metric in improving emotion classification and producing models with reduced sensitive information leakage.\n\nTo ensure that our proposed metric aligns with annotator choices, we conduct a crowdsourcing survey. The survey results indicate that our metric aligns well with annotator choices, thereby validating the effectiveness of our approach. The metric can be similarly applied to any other human-centered subjective tasks, such as, deception detection, opinion analysis etc.",

We select a representative sample population by considering three levels of: 1) valence (low, medium, and high, see Section 3.2.1) and 2) the metrics of 𝐻𝐶 𝑀 𝑠𝑖𝑟 𝑠𝑡𝑛 𝐺𝑛𝑑 : 𝑠 (low, medium, and high, measured via quantiles). This results in nine bins. The evaluators were not presented with the names of the models and the order of model outputs was randomized for each viewing. Note that the sentence was chosen to clearly convey gender, and potentially, gendered information. In the figure, green indicates that the model is using the word in the prediction, while red indicates that it is not. The outputs correspond to: 1) GenControl -note the heavy focus on the word \"dress\", 2) SIRBias, 3) ArtNoise, 4) SIRAug, 5) SIRAdv (for model details, see Section 9.5.2). Observe that the three sensitive information reduction methods are no longer focusing on the word \"dress\".\n\nWe select 60 random samples from each bin for a total 540 samples. We classify each sample using our five models (SIRAdv, SIRAug, SIRBias, GenControl, ArtNoise, described above). We extract sample-level predictions. In addition, we extract sample-level explanations using Captum  [211] , Section 9.3.1.1).\n\nArtNoise is used as a attention check baseline for human evaluation, ensuring that the evaluators are paying attention to the task at hand. We consider this option as an attention check and discard any response where the crowdsourced worker preferred the result and/or the explanation from this model (7.31% samples were discarded in total).\n\nWe presented the predictions from the models and heat map-based explanations. We asked the workers to choose between the five models, focusing on the following questions:\n\n(1) which model are you more likely to trust for emotion prediction and (2) which model are you more likely to trust for not being able to predict sensitive information.\n\nWe recruited annotators using Prolific from a population of workers with the following characteristics: 1) in the United States, and 2) native English speakers. Each task was annotated by three workers. We used qualification tests to check that all workers understood valence. Each task took an average of one-minute. The compensation was $9.45/hr. The baseline emotion classification model (Base) for within-corpus valence classification has 0.65 UAR for IEMOCAP, 0.68 for MuSE, and, 0.54 for MSP-Podcast (chance is 0.33 UAR), which is comparable to existing approaches on this domain  [9] .\n\nIn the cross-corpus setting, we see an average drop of at least 15% on all the models and datasets permutations. For example, a model trained on IEMOCAP and tested on MuSE has a UAR of 0.58 for Base, and, 0.53 for the SIRAdv model, which is significantly lower (paired t-test adjusted for multiple comparisons, p=0.0017) than the performance of these models when trained and tested on MuSE (0.68 and 0.71 respectively).\n\nThe multi-dataset emotion classification model has an overall higher performance in the cross-corpus setting. For example, the Multi-D has 0.64 UAR for IEMOCAP as compared to 0.61 and 0.57 obtained using Base.\n\nWe find that while reducing sensitive information leakage reduces within-corpus emotion recognition performance in many cases, these sensitive information leakage reduced models, especially SIRAdv usually have equivalent or better performance as compared to Base in cross-corpus setting, e.g., Base and SIRAdv trained on MuSE and tested on IEMOCAP has a UAR of 0.61 and 0.63, respectively. We initially validate the assumption that the HCM sir ri Gen metric is very low for the GenControl model (-0.21). This aligns with our expectation that the relative sensitive information reduction should be low. The goal of the GenControl model is to learn, rather than ignore, gender identity.\n\nFor within corpus settings, our expectation is that the SIRAug and SIRAug models will have the highest HCM sir ri Gen values. We find that across all the datasets, and models, gender leakage is significantly negatively correlated (paired t-test adjusted for multiple comparisons)\n\nwith HCM sir ri Gen for both within corpus (-0.95 * ) and cross-corpus (-0.89 * ) evaluation. ( * refers to significant value when using paired t-test adjusted for multiple comparisons)\n\nWe expect that models that generalize well will have high HCM in cross-corpus settings (Table  9 .1). In within corpus settings, we find that the addition of metric still benefits sensitive information reduction but can also lead to a non-negligible drop in emotion recognition performance. We also find that while age (HCM sir stn Age) and race (HCM sir stn Race) metrics on their own do not signify any positive change in cross-corpus dataset performance. We find that the metrics can be jointly considered in a simple multi-task setup between the primary task (i.e., emotion) and an adversarial component (HCM sir stn Gen). The multi-task setup results in the best performing gender information reduction (we do not have labels to measure age/race) of emotion recognition model (Table  9 .2).",

      "text": "We find that optimizing for alignment with the human-centered metric leads to better cross-corpus performance across every setup (Table  9 .1). For example, when we augment the Base model trained on IEMOCAP with HCM gz stn Emo. The UAR increases to 0.6 and 0.45 for Muse and MSP-Podcast respectively, as compared to 0.58 and 0.43. Additionally, we find that, training the model with these metrics give us better or equivalent performance to when using the combined dataset method, which was the best solely emotion recognition model. This shows the effectiveness of the metric, and lowers the required computation time and power.\n\nWe also see that while we see a performance increase for cross-dataset testing, some within dataset performances are lower than the generally trained model (e.g., Base has UAR 0.54 for MSP-Podcast, but Base+HCM gz stn Emo has a UAR 0.52). We hypothesize that this occurs because the models were relying on spurious correlations (sprurious, with respect to emotion recognition), which, when removed, decreased the model's performance.  We find that the two components interact to give better performance on both cross-corpus emotion recognition and sensitive information reduction performance. For example, we see an improved UAR of 0.67 on IEMOCAP (cross-corpus), compared to 0.62 from the Base method). Further, we also see that the gender leakage universally reduces when training the models on this combination (cross-corpus testing on MSP-Podcast when using composite metric training on Muse improves performance by 6%). We hypothesize that encouraging certain generalizable correlations while discouraging spurious correlations leads to models that are more robust and have reduced sensitive information leakage across the spectrum, but the enforcement of specific 'unlearning' often leads to negligible drops in within-corpus sensitive information reduction performance.\n\nFinally, we found that inclusion of age and race, to gender, as sensitive information reduction components improves emotion recognition performance in cross corpus evaluation (Please see the full results table in the appendix). We show that user preference depends on what the user was asked to consider the model's behavior for, with respect to emotion or to sensitive information leakage  [103] . The user preference for emotion recognition models is significantly correlated with within-corpus valence recognition performance (0.78) and with the HCM gz stn Emo metric (0.71).\n\nThe correlation between user preference for emotion recognition and the HCM sir ri Gen metric is negligible (0.09). This suggests that when asked to focus on emotion recognition performance with models that have the same prediction but different highlighted words, both performance and the potential for generalizability (when grasped using the highlighted words/phrases for attributed by the model for the prediction) dominate user preference.\n\nWhen choosing sensitive information leakage reducing model, we find that user's preference is moderately correlated with emotion recognition performance (0.46) and strongly negatively correlated with the ability to predict gender (-0.86). This is also supported by the correlation between user preference and HCM sir ri Gen (0.64) and HCM gz stn Emo (0.81).\n\nThis support the hypothesis that, human perception can be encoded into models through the proposed metric template (HCM[T]).",
