Research indicates that different types of music can elicit various neural responses, thereby affecting emotional states. Recording brain activity via EEG while listening to music provides deep insights into the mechanisms by which music influences emotions.

Their portability and ease of use make them essential tools in various domains, including affective computing, BCI, sleep management, emotion regulation, depression treatment, and fatigue monitoring. These devices, such as the Emotiv EPOC+ and Muse  [24] , enable real-time recording and analysis of an individual's emotional state by capturing EEG signals and identifying emotional changes, facilitating emotion regulation and psychological therapy  [25] . In BCI technology, EEG devices decode brain signals to help users control external devices, such as enabling individuals with disabilities to operate wheelchairs. In sleep management, these devices analyze brain activity during sleep, providing feedback on sleep quality and promoting better sleep habits. They also aid in the long-term monitoring of emotional changes for diagnosing and treating emotional disorders, and in fatigue monitoring by providing real-time alerts during work or driving to prevent accidents.\n\nWearable EEG devices offer numerous advantages. Their portability and ease of use make them suitable for long-term wear and operation, meeting various application scenarios  [26] . These devices provide real-time monitoring of brain signals, offering immediate feedback and monitoring results. Advanced devices like Mindeep support multiple electrode types, feature long battery life, impedance detection, and WiFi wireless transmission, and can provide high-quality raw data and multi-device synchronous data collection. However, these devices also have limitations. Despite offering higher sampling rates and data quality, many commercial devices still face constraints in sampling rate, signal resolution, and noise control. EEG signals are susceptible to artifacts from eye movements and muscle activity, necessitating complex preprocessing and signal processing algorithms, increasing data analysis complexity  [27] [28] [29] [30] [31] . High-end devices are expensive, and cost considerations remain a factor for average users and some research institutions. Additionally, dry electrode devices may face issues with electrode contact and signal distortion, affecting data accuracy and stability  [32, 33] .\n\nUsing these devices, researchers can efficiently record real-time brain activity data from participants while they listen to music, allowing for accurate analysis and prediction of brain responses to musical stimuli. Bi-LSTM models  [34] [35] [36] [37] [38]  capture long-term dependencies in EEG signals and, combined with attention mechanisms, improve the extraction of key features.

EEG involves placing electrodes on the scalp to capture the brain's electrical activity in real-time, boasting high temporal resolution. It is extensively used in affective computing, BCI, and cognitive neuroscience. Functional MRI (fMRI)  [40] , which measures blood oxygen level-dependent (BOLD) signals  [41] , provides high spatial resolution images of brain structure and function, making it invaluable for brain function localization, disease diagnosis, and cognitive research. Combining these techniques allows for multi-faceted brain activity analysis; for example, EEG can monitor real-time emotional changes while fMRI can precisely locate emotionrelated brain activity.\n\nEach method has distinct advantages and limitations. EEG's high temporal resolution enables millisecond-level recording of brain activity, ideal for studying rapid neural processes. Its portability and non-invasiveness make longterm monitoring and convenient operation possible, especially with wearable devices. The relatively low cost of EEG equipment makes it suitable for large-scale and daily monitoring. However, EEG's low spatial resolution limits its ability to reflect deep brain activity, and EEG signals are prone to artifacts, requiring complex preprocessing and signal processing algorithms. On the other hand, MRI's high spatial resolution provides detailed images of brain structures and functions. Its multi-modal imaging capabilities, such as combining structural imaging, functional imaging, and diffusion tensor imaging (DTI)  [42] , offer comprehensive brain information. MRI is also non-invasive, suitable for repeated examinations. Nonetheless, MRI's low temporal resolution makes it challenging to capture rapid neural activity changes. The high cost and operational complexity of MRI equipment, requiring professional maintenance and operation, limit its widespread use. Additionally, MRI is sensitive to motion artifacts, necessitating strict control of the experimental environment.",

Music is known to activate multiple brain regions, including the auditory cortex, limbic system, and prefrontal cortex, thereby influencing emotional and cognitive functions. In affective computing, emotional responses induced by music are used to study the brain's emotion processing mechanisms  [62] . For instance, by analyzing EEG signals while listening to music, researchers can identify the emotional states elicited by different musical stimuli, which is valuable in music therapy and emotion computing. In cognitive neuroscience, music is used to study cognitive functions such as attention and memory. Additionally, auditory stimuli are applied in BCI systems to decode brain signals induced by auditory stimuli, enabling control of external devices.\n\nAuditory stimulation offers numerous advantages in studying brain activity  [63] . Music, as a complex auditory stimulus, can activate multiple brain regions, providing researchers with a comprehensive understanding of the brain's emotional and cognitive processing mechanisms. Music stimuli are easy to control and standardize, ensuring high repeatability and reliability of experimental results. Furthermore, the effects of music on the brain are apparent and significant, allowing researchers to clearly observe changes in brain activity through EEG signals  [64] .\n\nHowever, auditory stimulation also presents some challenges. Firstly, individual differences in emotional responses to music can significantly affect the generalizability and consistency of experimental results. Secondly, music-induced EEG signals are complex, involving multiple frequency bands and brain regions, requiring sophisticated signal processing and analysis techniques. Additionally, the effects of music on the brain are transient, posing challenges in effectively capturing and analyzing these brief changes.\n\nBy using wearable EEG devices to record brain activity while participants listen to music, researchers can monitor and analyze the brain's response to musical stimuli in real-time.

      "text": "In EEG-based emotion recognition research utilizing graph neural networks  [71] [72] [73] , it is known that describing the relationships between different EEG electrode channels, i.e., constructing an adjacency matrix, is crucial for EEG emotion classification. In this section, we use the spatial distance between EEG nodes to construct the adjacency matrix representing the topology of EEG channels. The specific construction process is as follows:\n\nThe adjacency matrix A ∈ ℝ 𝑛×𝑛 , where 𝑛 denotes the number of channels in the EEG signals. Each entry 𝑎 𝑖𝑗 is learnable and represents the connection weight between channel 𝑖 and channel 𝑗. The international 10-20 EEG electrode system provides the three-dimensional coordinates of each electrode mapped onto a unit sphere. The physical distance between two electrodes is used to measure the connection relationship in the brain space. The farther the distance, the less tightly the channels are connected. Suppose the coordinates of two points on the sphere with radius 𝑟 are (𝑥 𝑖 , 𝑦 𝑖 , 𝑧 𝑖 ) and (𝑥 𝑗 , 𝑦 𝑗 , 𝑧 𝑗 ), the distance 𝑑 𝑖𝑗 between the two points in Cartesian space can be expressed as shown in Equation  3 .\n\nFigure  2  below is a schematic diagram of the 3D spatial relationship of EEG channels used to construct the model's adjacency matrix. The points in the 3D graph represent the electrode positions of the wearable EEG device used for measuring brainwave activity. In sparse fMRI networks, using about 20% of all possible connections typically maximizes the efficiency of network topology. Therefore, for each EEG channel, we retain connections to its nearest 𝐾 channels, considering them as connected. The value of 𝐾 is chosen based on the number of electrode channels used in the EEG data acquisition equipment. For devices with 62 electrode channels, the value of 𝐾 is selected as 62 × 20% ≈ 12.\n\nThe asymmetry of neural activity between the left and right hemispheres is significant in valence and arousal prediction. Therefore, we select certain electrode pairs to initialize the adjacency matrix. To leverage the asymmetry information between the left and right hemispheres, we use 9 global connection pairs and initialize the global interchannel relationships in the adjacency matrix as shown in Equation  4 :\n\nAs shown in Figure  3 , the global channel pairs (𝑖, 𝑗) used for initialization are (FP1, FP2), (AF3, AF4), (F5, F6), (FC5, FC6), (C5, C6), (CP5, CP6), (P5, P6), (PO5, PO6), and (O1, O2).",

      "text": "Bi-LSTM is a deep learning model based on LSTM. LSTM networks, through their unique gating mechanisms, can effectively capture and learn long-term dependencies in sequential data, addressing the issues of gradient vanishing and exploding in traditional RNNs (Recurrent Neural Networks).\n\nAs shown in Figure  3 , unlike traditional unidirectional LSTM, Bi-LSTM comprises two LSTM layers: one processes the sequence forward, and the other processes it backward. This bidirectional mechanism enables Bi-LSTM to leverage both past and future information in the sequence, enhancing the model's understanding of time-series data. In Bi-LSTM, the forward LSTM layer processes EEG samples from time index 1 to 𝑡, generating the forward hidden state sequence ⃖⃖ ⃗ ℎ 𝑡 , while the backward LSTM layer processes EEG samples from time index 𝑡 + 1 to the end, generating the backward hidden state output ⃖⃖⃖ ℎ 𝑡 . This bidirectional processing mechanism allows Bi-LSTM to capture dynamic changes in EEG signals and more accurately model long-term dependencies in the signals. The left part of Figure  4  illustrates the original architecture of LSTM, where the cell's output state update is related to the previous hidden layer output and the current input. At each time step 𝑡, the LSTM unit receives the current input 𝑥 𝑡 , the hidden state ℎ 𝑡-1 , and the cell state 𝑐 𝑡-1 from the previous time step. The LSTM controls information storage and transfer through three gating mechanisms: the input gate, the forget gate, and the output gate. The input gate 𝑖 𝑡 determines the update of the cell state by the current input, the forget gate 𝑓 𝑡 decides whether to retain the previous cell state 𝑐 𝑡-1 , and the output gate 𝑜 𝑡 decides whether to transfer the hidden state ℎ 𝑡-1 to the next LSTM unit. The candidate cell state c𝑡 is a nonlinear transformation of the current input and the previous hidden state. The current cell state 𝑐 𝑡 is updated through the forget gate and the input gate, and the current hidden state ℎ 𝑡 is determined by the output gate and the nonlinear transformation of the current cell state. Here, 𝜎 represents the sigmoid activation function, tanh represents the tanh activation function, ⊙ denotes elementwise multiplication, 𝑊 and 𝑈 are weight matrices, and 𝑏 is the bias vector. The formulas for the LSTM unit are shown below:\n\nBi-LSTM combines the outputs of the forward and backward LSTM layers to form the final hidden state output ℎ 𝑡 . The forward hidden state is computed by the forward LSTM layer, and the backward hidden state is computed by the backward LSTM layer. By combining the forward and backward hidden states, Bi-LSTM can more comprehensively understand the temporal information in EEG signals, leading to higher accuracy in emotion recognition. The formulas for the Bi-LSTM unit are shown below:\n\nIn emotion recognition models, Bi-LSTM effectively captures the temporal dynamics in EEG signals through its bidirectional mechanism. Using wearable frontal EEG signal monitoring devices, EEG signals of participants are recorded while they listen to different types of music. The device employs dry electrode technology, simplifying the signal acquisition process and making it suitable for largescale daily applications. The collected EEG signals undergo preprocessing, including denoising, filtering, and feature extraction, to ensure signal quality and analysis accuracy. The Bi-LSTM model processes the preprocessed EEG signals through forward and backward LSTM layers, extracting deep features. By incorporating attention mechanisms to focus on important moments in the signals, this study introduces an improved LSTM method, as shown on the right side of Figure  4 , which incorporates the attention mechanism to capture essential historical information and update the cell state. This ultimately improves the accuracy and robustness of emotion recognition, as represented by Eq. 7:\n\nwhere 𝑣 𝑓 and 𝑤 𝑓 are the parameters of the attention mechanism.

Information in EEG signals is primarily contained within the frequency spectrum of 0.5 to several tens of Hertz. Based on frequency differences, EEG signals can be classified into five bands: 𝛿 band (Delta, 1-4 𝐻𝑧), 𝜃 band (Theta, 4-8 𝐻𝑧), 𝛼 band (Alpha, 8-12 𝐻𝑧), 𝛽 band (Beta, 12-30 𝐻𝑧), and 𝛾 band (Gamma, > 30 Hz).

The current predominant method for EEG data collection is the wet electrode method, which has the advantage of obtaining more distinct EEG data but is inconvenient and less suitable for practical, everyday collection. The use of dry electrodes for EEG signal collection does not require an electrolyte, allowing the electrodes to contact the scalp directly, thereby offering greater convenience.

The models we employed include Support Vector Machine (SVM)  [77] , Pyramid Match Kernel (PMK)  [78] , EEG-Net  [79] , LSTM  [80] , and Bi-LSTM. SVM is a supervised learning model used for classification and regression analysis, effectively handling high-dimensional data. PMK is a kernel function used for image matching by processing image features through a pyramid structure to achieve efficient matching. EEG-Net is a deep learning model specifically designed for processing and analyzing EEG data to improve the classification and recognition performance of EEG signals. LSTM is a type of RNN model that addresses long-term dependency issues through its gating mechanism, making it suitable for handling sequential data. Bi-LSTM consists of forward and backward LSTM layers, enabling the model to utilize both past and future information in the sequence, thus enhancing its understanding of temporal data.\n\nOur proposal and the performance comparison of these models are shown in Table  3 . In addition to these advanced model algorithms, we also compared our model with the incorporation of attention gates and attention weights to explore the effectiveness of Bi-LSTM. As shown in the table, the Bi-LSTM models with attention mechanisms significantly improved accuracy. Specifically, the Bi-LSTM-AttGW (1 layer and 128 hidden size) model achieved the highest accuracy of 98.28% in multiclass tasks. This demonstrates that incorporating attention mechanisms can significantly enhance the performance of models in emotion recognition using EEG signals. This method greatly improves the accuracy of capturing EEG signals.\n\nAs shown in Table  4 , we compared the accuracy and standard deviation of different models in various frequency bands of the SEED dataset. Our proposed model demonstrated superior performance across all frequency bands, particularly in the 𝛾 band, where it achieved an accuracy of 98.28% with a standard deviation of 7.42. This highlights To visualize the EEG signal activity of the brain, we applied a low-pass filter at 8 𝐻𝑧 to the EEG signals from the SEED dataset to remove high-frequency noise. Figure  6  shows the EEG signal fragments in the regions of interest (ROIs) using the 130-electrode system layout. Each row in the figure represents the brain activity recorded for a segment from different movies, illustrating the variations in EEG signals in response to different emotional stimuli.\n\nThe first row represents the brain activity recorded for a segment from the movie Lost in Thailand, showing EEG signal snippets from 50 ms before to 130 ms after each beat mark. We performed baseline correction for each EEG signal band by subtracting the mean value calculated from the 50 ms segments between beat marks. The second row represents brain activity for a segment from the movie Back to 1942, recorded from 100 ms before to 180 ms after each beat mark, with baseline correction applied every 20 ms. The third row shows brain activity for a segment from the movie World Heritage in China, recorded from 55 ms before to 130 ms after each beat mark, with baseline correction applied every 25 ms. This detailed breakdown demonstrates the dynamic changes in brain activity elicited by different emotional stimuli across multiple time points.\n\nWhen recording EEG data, the signal initially shows a negative dip at 0 ms. Any auditory processing related to the music beats occurs shortly afterward. One possible explanation is that the sudden change in the music beat causes a sudden dip in the EEG signal. However, this requires further investigation. It could also be due to inaccuracies in the wearable device used to collect the signal or the sampling rate and tracker precision. For further comparison, Figure  7  shows the EEG signal changes at the imagined time points corresponding to different movie scenes in the SEED dataset. This figure corresponds to the second row in Figure  6 , showing the variations in the ROIs. The amplitude range of these EEG signal changes is relatively large, likely due to the emotional intensity provided by the movie segments. To calculate meaningful fluctuations, precise timing (e.g., sudden events) must be known. However, small changes during EEG signal recording are likely, causing some imprecision in the beat marks. To understand the event-related effects on EEG signals induced by auditory and visual stimuli, we used the DEAP dataset, which contains emotion-related EEG signals. We analyzed the five EEG frequency bands affected by emotional states (as shown in Table  2 ). We employed Event-Related Potentials (ERP) metrics to record these changes. ERP refers to the specific potentials induced by stimuli such as auditory and visual cues, excluding spontaneous EEG signals. With its high temporal resolution, ERP can reflect changes in brain neurophysiological activities during cognitive processes, making it a widely used tool for assessing brain cognitive processing. The features commonly analyzed in ERP data are the latency and peaks of its components.\n\nThe main components of ERP include P100, N100, P200, N200, and P300. Most studies focus on the P300 component of ERP data for brainwave analysis. The P300 component is a positive deflection occurring around 300 milliseconds post-stimulus. Table  5  presents the statistical results of P300 values from ERP data in the DEAP dataset. It is evident from the table that participants exhibit more intense emotional reactions to sad music scenes. We used a Bi-LSTM model to simulate and predict EEG signal fluctuations recorded in the DEAP dataset. The Data_preprocessed files were fed into a linear filter to map the spectral output of the EEG signals, representing brain neural activity. We attempted to recreate the receptive field model of the linear filter to generate this data. The data were downsampled along the time dimension, and this receptive field was used to create an artificial neural response. This involved performing a dot product with the receptive field.

      "text": "This study records and analyzes brain activity while listening to music using wearable EEG devices and Bi-LSTM with attention mechanisms to identify emotional states. Data was collected using wearable EEG devices, preprocessed, and DE features were extracted. A Bi-LSTM model with attention mechanisms was then constructed, showing superior performance in emotion recognition, particularly with the SEED and DEAP datasets. The Bi-LSTM-AttGW model achieved the highest accuracy of 98.28% in multi-class tasks.\n\nThe novelty of this study lies in the integration of Bi-LSTM with attention mechanisms for EEG signal processing. This combination significantly improves the accuracy Despite these achievements, there are limitations. Wearable EEG devices have relatively low sampling rates and are prone to artifacts, affecting signal quality. Future research should focus on improving device design and signal processing algorithms. Additionally, larger sample sizes and more diverse experimental conditions are needed to account for individual differences in emotional responses to music. Further integration of multimodal data and various emotional elicitation methods could enhance the accuracy and applicability of emotion recognition in BCI and affective computing.",
