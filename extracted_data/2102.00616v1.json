      "text": "Music is often considered as the language of emotions. It has long been known to elicit emotions in human being and thus categorizing music based on the type of emotions they induce in human being is a very intriguing topic of research. When the task comes to classify emotions elicited by Indian Classical Music (ICM), it becomes much more challenging because of the inherent ambiguity associated with ICM. The fact that a single musical performance can evoke a variety of emotional response in the audience is implicit to the nature of ICM renditions. With the rapid advancements in the field of Deep Learning, this Music Emotion Recognition (MER) task is becoming more and more relevant and robust, hence can be applied to one of the most challenging test case i.e. classifying emotions elicited from ICM. In this paper we present a new dataset called JUMusEmoDB which presently has 400 audio clips (30 seconds each) where 200 clips correspond to happy emotions and the remaining 200 clips correspond to sad emotion. The initial annotations and emotional classification of the database has been done based on an emotional rating test (5-point Likert scale) performed by 100 participants. The clips have been taken from different conventional 'raga' renditions played in sitar by an eminent maestro of ICM and digitized in 44.1 kHz frequency. The ragas, which are unique to ICM, are described as musical structures capable of inducing different moods or emotions. For supervised classification purposes, we have used 4 existing deep Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) based architectures (resnet18, mobilenet v2.0, squeezenet v1.0 and vgg16) on corresponding music spectrograms of the 2000 sub-clips (where every clip was segmented into 5 sub-clips of about 5 seconds each) which contain both time as well as frequency domain information. The initial results are quite inspiring, and we look forward to setting the baseline values for the dataset using this architecture. This type of CNN based classification algorithm using a rich corpus of Indian Classical Music is unique even in the global perspective and can be replicated in other modalities of music also. This dataset is still under development and we plan to include more data containing other emotional features as well. We plan to make the dataset publicly available soon.",

      "text": "Music imposes emotion. Considering the very basic, major scale always creates a happier ambience whereas minor scale creates a bit sad. This response to melody and rhythm is a biological instinct. A non-musician's ear can feel the pain when Garry Moore plays \"Loner\", even a baby responds to different scales and melody lines. While talking about emotions elicited by Indian Classical Music (ICM) it always becomes a matter of huge challenge for its ambiguous emotional response. Studies involving non-linear techniques have been conducted in the recent past to understand this complex behavior of music and its manifestation in the human brain  [13 -17] .\n\nIn the recent years, Machine Learning has made significant advancements in a multitude of fields including computer vision, medical imaging, natural language processing and so on  [18 -37] . Such Machine Learning and Deep Learning approaches have been used to identify different emotions associated with music  [9 -12] . So, Music Emotion Recognition (MER) has always been an interesting task to perform for observing the correlation between the music and perceived emotion. Music Emotion Recognition task was first introduced by Barthet et al  [5] . Since then, several developments have been achieved on this discipline, and hence it has become very important to observe the role of ICM in elicitation of emotion.\n\nTo exploit the significance of emotion induction in ICM, we need a proper database to work with. Previously datasets like Computer Audition Lab 500-song (CAL500)  [6] , CAL500exp  [7] , datasets have been introduced, which is enriched with 500 western music clips. Here in this paper we have introduced a database JUMusEmoDB enriched with 400 music clips from genre of Indian Classical Music, of which 200 clips fall into the category of happy emotion while 200 falls into sad. Each clip is of 30 seconds length which is long enough for introducing an emotional imposition  [8] . All the clips are parts of different 'raga' renditions improvised in Sitar by an eminent maestro of ICM. Each Raga in ICM evokes not a particular emotion (rasa), but a superposition of different emotional states such as joy, sadness, anger, disgust, fear etc. To decipher which particular emotion is conveyed in the chosen 30 sec segment of the raga, an emotion annotation was performed initially by 100 participants based on 5-point Likert scale.\n\nFor an emotion classification task different acoustic features of music are very important. Different acoustic feature consists of (a) Rhythmic Features: Tempo, Silence etc.; (b) Timbral Features: MFCC, Average Energy, Spectral Centroid, Spectral Tilt etc.; (c) Chroma Features. These acoustic features quantify the musicality of a clip which in effect contributes to MER. Study on this knowledge driven approaches results in an efficient model structure; but before this, a validated dataset is very necessary to work with. After the emotion annotation, a data driven approach has been used to validate our dataset.\n\nWe have taken an image processing-oriented approach to classify the dataset into emotion tags. We primarily extracted the spectrogram of a clip and fed the processed spectrogram image into existing deep Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) based architectures. These CNNs were then trained to classify emotions. For this study, we have made use of four different existing CNN architectures: VGG16, ResNet18, MobileNet v2.0, SqueezeNet v1.0 and have received some promising results. Furthermore, the dataset used in our study which we have named as JUMusEmoDB, is a novel dataset comprising of clips from Indian Classical Music genre. This dataset currently has musical clips from two emotions, namely happy and sad, and is still under development. We plan to include more data containing other emotional features eventually making the dataset publicly available shortly. This dataset can be used in future by the scientific community for emotion classification purposes, to investigate the impact of Indian Classical Music on human brain and finally to conduct cross-cultural studies combining both Western Classical and Indian Classical musical clips.\n\nThe paper has been organized as follows: Section 2 contains Data Acquisition, Section 3 comprises of the Methods used, the Experiments and Results of the study have been mentioned in Section 4 and finally Section 5 has the conclusion.",

Now a general question arises regarding why a data driven approach is being followed primarily rather than any novel knowledge-based quantification. To answer this, we have to take into account that a successful classification with high accuracy rate will validate the authenticity of JUMusEmoDB, which can then be used to develop new knowledge-based models to test on this database.",

Kaiming He, Xiangyu Zhang, Shaoqing Ren, Jian Sun has proposed a residual network with a depth of up to 152 layers (Fig.  3 4 ) i.e., 8x deeper than VGG-19 nets  [2] . Increasing depth of a network can lead to a very serious problem of vanishing gradient which results in saturation of convergence with a very high training error and low accuracy problems. Kaiming He et al. has beautifully taken care of these facts and modified a very deep network to gain a high accuracy with low training error. They have implemented a \"short-cut connection\" of identity mapping. Their approach was to allow the network to fit the stacked layers to a residual mapping using residual block (Fig.  3 ) instead of fitting them directly to the underlying mapping. So, instead of feeding 𝐻(𝑥) (desired underlying mapping) let the stacked network fit, 𝐹(𝑥) ∶= 𝐻(𝑥) -𝑥 and thus ultimately gives𝐻(𝑥) ∶= 𝐹(𝑥) + 𝑥.",

MSE (mean squared error), MAE (mean absolute error) has been used a lot as loss functions for image purposes. In our classification task we have made use of cross entropy loss. Entropy is a measure of uncertainty, and it is measured as,  where 𝑦 𝑖 is the calculated or predicted output and 𝑦 𝑖 ̂ is the actual output. Previously we have introduced our used framework and model improvisation. In this section we are illustrating the acquired results. For our work, we used a train/validation split ratio as 85/15. In the training phase we receive a model cost (calculated from loss function) which indicates the model performance. The loss curve for training phase for each model is shown in the Fig.  8 . With time (iterations) convergence is achieved for each of the models used and the performance of SquuezeNetV1 in the training phase also outperforms the other three models used.\n\nThe convergence plot helps to tune the parameters of CNN models. After adjusting the parameters, we obtain the best results for each CNN Models.",

Even though the advantage of employing CNN based architectures for tackling the problem of music emotion recognition include better overall accuracy because of better extraction of useful features from the data compared to other traditional methods, further studies need to be conducted to understand the source of emotions for a given music. Another limitation of this work is the lack of data in our dataset, but this is a pilot study it is still under development. We plan to incorporate more data containing other emotional features as well and eventually make the dataset publicly available shortly.",
