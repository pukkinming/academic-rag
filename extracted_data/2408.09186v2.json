      "text": "Emotion recognition using electroencephalography (EEG) signals has attracted increasing attention in recent years. However, existing methods often lack generalization in cross-corpus settings, where a model trained on one dataset is directly applied to another without retraining, due to differences in data distribution and recording conditions. To tackle the challenge of cross-corpus EEG-based emotion recognition, we propose a novel framework termed Soft Contrastive Masked Modeling (SCMM). Grounded in the theory of emotional continuity, SCMM integrates soft contrastive learning with a hybrid masking strategy to effectively capture emotion dynamics (refer to short-term continuity). Specifically, in the self-supervised learning stage, we propose a soft weighting mechanism that assigns similarity scores to sample pairs, enabling fine-grained modeling of emotional transitions and capturing the temporal continuity of human emotions. To further enhance representation learning, we design a similarity-aware aggregator that fuses complementary information from semantically related samples based on pairwise similarities, thereby improving feature expressiveness and reconstruction quality. This dual design contributes to a more discriminative and transferable representation, which is crucial for robust cross-corpus generalization. Extensive experiments on the SEED, SEED-IV, and DEAP datasets show that SCMM achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance, outperforming the secondbest method by an average accuracy of 4.26% under both same-class and different-class cross-corpus settings.

      "text": "Emotions are human attitudinal experiences and behavioral responses to objective things, closely related to an individual's health conditions and behavioral patterns  [45] . Compared to speech  [40] , gestures  [31] , and facial expressions  [2] , electroencephalography (EEG) offers a more direct and objective measurement of human emotions by capturing brain activity across various scalp locations  [16] . Therefore, researchers have increasingly emphasized EEGbased emotion recognition in recent years  [50, 51, 53, 56] , aiming to advance the development of affective brain-computer interfaces (aBCIs). However, three critical challenges remain to be addressed in current approaches.\n\n(1) Insufficient Generalization Capability. Most existing EEGbased emotion recognition methods are typically designed for a single dataset, necessitating model retraining when the dataset changes. This requirement significantly limits the scalability and generalizability of the model, hindering its application on different datasets. To address this issue, the concept of cross-corpus has been proposed, which is designed to be generalized across multiple datasets. A cross-corpus model is trained on one dataset and can be directly applied to another without retraining from scratch. This concept, which originated in natural language processing  [38, 52] , has been extended to various domains in recent years  [5, 35, 37] . Although existing EEG-based emotion recognition methods, such as BiDANN  [28] , TANN  [26] , and PR-PL  [57] , have demonstrated superior performance in within-subject or cross-subject tasks within a single dataset, their effectiveness significantly degrades in crosscorpus scenarios, where the differences in data distribution across datasets far exceed the intra-dataset variability  [35] .\n\n(2) Modeling Strategy Limitation. Recently, researchers have explored domain adaptation techniques to address cross-corpus EEG-based emotion recognition  [14, 58] . This is motivated by their  efficacy to solve the problem of domain shift  [10] . Despite initial success, such approaches often require prior access to all labeled source data and unlabeled target data for model training. Considering the difficulties in collecting EEG signals as well as the time and expertise required to label them, the modeling strategy limitation of domain adaptation techniques poses a significant challenge to real-world aBCI applications.\n\n(3) Ignorance of Emotional Continuity. Unlike domain adaptation techniques, contrastive learning (CL) achieves superior performance without relying on labeled data, and has shown great potential in various fields  [4, 9, 34] . Current CL-based methods for EEG-based emotion recognition, such as CLISA  [39]  and JCFA  [29] , consider an anchor and its augmented views as positive pairs, while treating all other samples as negatives. When computing the contrastive loss, the weights for positives and negatives are set to 1 and 0, respectively, as shown in Fig.  1 (b) (Hard CL). However, psychological and neuroscientific studies suggest that emotion analysis using brain signals should account for dynamic changes  [6, 15] . Specifically, emotions exhibit significant \"short-term continuity\" characteristics, meaning that human emotions are relatively stable over certain periods, with sudden changes being rare. As illustrated in Fig.  1 (a), a high cosine similarity is maintained between an anchor sample 𝑥 𝑖 and its neighboring sample 𝑥 𝑗 , and even a distant sample 𝑥 𝑘 separated by extended periods (e.g., 60 seconds). Given this nature of emotions, we propose that the definition of positive pairs in CL-based EEG emotion analysis should extend beyond just the anchor and its augmented views. Instead, it should include a broader range of similar samples, especially those that are temporally proximal, as shown in Fig.  1 (b) (SCMM). In contrast, existing methods following the traditional CL paradigm  [4]  may incorrectly pull apart similar but not identical samples, thus failing to capture the emotional continuity inherent in EEG signals.\n\nTo tackle the aforementioned three critical issues, we propose a novel Soft Contrastive Masked Modeling (SCMM) framework for cross-corpus EEG-based emotion recognition. Unlike traditional hard CL shown in Fig.  1 (b), SCMM considers emotional continuity and incorporates soft assignments of sample pairs. This approach enables the model to identify the fine-grained relationships between different samples in a self-supervised manner, thereby enhancing the generalizability of EEG representations. Comprehensive experiments on three well-recognized datasets show that SCMM consistently achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance, demonstrating its superior capability and stability. In summary, the main contributions of SCMM are outlined as follows:\n\n• We propose a novel SCMM framework to address three key challenges (insufficient generalization capability, modeling strategy limitation, and ignorance of emotional continuity) in cross-corpus EEG-based emotion recognition.\n\n• Inspired by the nature of emotions, we introduce a soft weighting mechanism that assigns similarity scores to sample pairs to capture the similarity relationships between different samples. As a result, better feature representations of EEG signals are learned in a self-supervised manner. • We develop a new hybrid masking strategy to generate diverse masked samples by considering both channel and feature relationships, which is essential for enhancing contrastive learning. In addition, we introduce a similarity-aware aggregator to fuse complementary information from semantically related samples, enabling fine-grained feature learning and improving the model's overall capability. • We conduct extensive experiments on three well-known datasets (SEED, SEED-IV, and DEAP), demonstrating that SCMM achieves SOTA performance against 10 baselines, with an average accuracy improvement of 4.26% under both same-class and different-class cross-corpus settings.",

      "text": "Current approaches for EEG-based emotion recognition mainly rely on two types of experimental protocols: (1) subject-dependent and (2) subject-independent.\n\n(1) The subject-dependent protocol trains and tests models using EEG data from the same subject within a single dataset. For example, Duan et al.  [7]  extracted various emotion-related features from EEG signals and used support vector machine (SVM) and k-nearest neighbors (KNN) for emotion recognition. Similarly, Alsolamy et al.  [1]  inputted power spectral density (PSD) features into an SVM classifier to predict emotions while listening to the Quran. In terms of deep learning models, Zheng et al.  [55]  trained a deep belief network (DBN) using differential entropy (DE) features extracted from multi-channel EEG signals for subject-dependent emotion classification. Additionally, Song et al.  [41]  proposed a dynamical graph convolutional network (DGCNN) that dynamically learns the intrinsic relationship between different EEG channels to enhance the model's discriminative ability. In general, the subject-dependent protocol tends to achieve superior performance due to its potential to introduce information leakage. However, this protocol fails to take into account the significant individual differences of EEG signals, thus limiting its practical applications.\n\n(2) The subject-independent protocol trains and tests models using EEG data from different subjects within a single dataset. Since transfer learning has demonstrated its potential in addressing the problem of domain shift, a series of methods have adopted it for subject-independent EEG-based emotion recognition. For example, Li et al.  [28]  proposed a bi-hemispheres domain adversarial neural network (BiDANN) that considers distribution shift between training and testing data and cerebral hemispheres. Following this, a novel transferable attention neural network (TANN)  [26]  was introduced to learn the emotional discriminative information of EEG signals. To simultaneously adapt the marginal distribution and the conditional distribution, Li et al.  [22]  proposed a joint distribution adaptation network (JDA) for subject-independent EEG-based emotion recognition. Similarly, Chen et al.  [3]  introduced a multi-source marginal distribution adaptation network (MS-MDA) to capture both domain-invariant and domain-specific features of emotional EEG signals. Further, Zhou et al.  [57]  proposed a novel prototypical representation-based pairwise learning framework (PR-PL) to address individual differences and noisy labeling in emotional EEG signals. Despite the progress made in dealing with individual differences, these methods struggle to mitigate the distributional differences across datasets, resulting in significant performance degradation in cross-corpus scenarios.",

      "text": "To alleviate the large distributional differences across datasets, researchers have attempted to use domain adaptation techniques for cross-corpus EEG-based emotion recognition. For example, He et al.  [14]  proposed an adversarial discriminative temporal convolutional network (AD-TCN) that integrates the adversarial discriminative learning into a temporal convolutional network for enhancing distribution matching. Meanwhile, Li et al.  [24]  proposed a novel distillation-based domain generalization network (DBDG) to learn the discriminative and generalizable emotional features. Moreover, Zhou et al.  [58]  introduced an EEG-based emotion style transfer network (E 2 STN) that contains the content information of the source domain and the style information of the target domain, achieving superior performance in cross-corpus scenarios. However, these methods require prior access to all labeled source data and unlabeled target data for model training, which is not feasible in practical applications due to the difficulties in collecting and labeling EEG data. Therefore, recent studies have sought to leverage contrastive learning for cross-corpus EEG-based emotion recognition. A noteworthy attempt is JCFA  [29] , which performs joint contrastive learning across three domains to align the time-and frequency-based embeddings of the same EEG sample in the latent time-frequency space, achieving SOTA performance in cross-corpus EEG-based emotion recognition tasks. However, such approaches following the traditional CL paradigm  [4]  fail to capture the emotional continuity inherent in EEG signals, resulting in relatively limited performance in cross-corpus scenarios. Therefore, this study aims to develop a sufficiently generalized model without relying on labeled data, which can be directly applied to different EEG emotion datasets without retraining from scratch, and achieve accurate and efficient cross-corpus generalization.",

      "text": "The selection of masking strategies is crucial for CL and masked modeling. For an input EEG sample 𝑥 𝑖 ∈ 𝑋 , existing methods use random masking  [51]  or channel masking  [23]  to generate the masked sample 𝑥 𝑖 . The random masking strategy masks samples along the feature dimension, ignoring the inter-channel relationships of multi-channel EEG signals. While a large masking ratio (e.g., 75%) can mask entire portions of certain channels, it complicates the modeling process due to significant information loss. Conversely, the channel masking strategy masks features across all dimensions of the selected channels, losing the relationships between different dimensional features. Neither approach captures both channel and feature relationships simultaneously. Therefore, we develop a new hybrid masking strategy to generate diverse masked samples by considering both channel and feature relationships.\n\nSpecifically, we first generate a random masking matrix Mask 𝑅 ∈ {0, 1} with dimensions 𝐶×𝐹 and a channel masking matrix Mask 𝐶 ∈ {0, 1} with dimensions 𝐶 × 𝐹 , both derived from binomial distributions with the same masking ratio 𝑟 ∈ (0, 1). Here, the element values in each row of Mask 𝐶 are either all 1s or all 0s. Next, we generate a probability matrix 𝑈 ∈ [0, 1] with dimensions 𝐶 × 1 for hybrid masking, which is drawn from a uniform distribution. The hybrid masking process is defined as:\n\nwhere ⊙ denotes element-wise multiplication. 𝑥 𝑖,𝑐 represents the DE features of the 𝑐-th channel of 𝑥 𝑖 , and 𝑥 𝑖,𝑐 is the corresponding",

However, we argue that this approach fails to account for the \"short-term continuity\" characteristic inherent in human emotions, leading to inaccurate modeling of inter-sample relationships and hindering the generalizability of the learned embeddings.\n\nTo address this issue, we propose defining soft assignments for different sample pairs, as shown in Fig.  1 (b) (SCMM). We first input 𝑥 𝑖 and 𝑥 𝑖 into an encoder 𝐸 that maps samples to embeddings, denoted as ℎ 𝑖 = 𝐸 (𝑥 𝑖 ) and ℎ 𝑖 = 𝐸 ( 𝑥 𝑖 ). These embeddings are then projected into a latent space Z using a projector 𝑃, resulting in 𝑧 𝑖 = 𝑃 (ℎ 𝑖 ) and 𝑧 𝑖 = 𝑃 ( ℎ 𝑖 ). Next, we perform soft contrastive learning in Z using 𝑧 𝑖 and 𝑧 𝑖 . Specifically, for a given pair of samples (𝑥 𝑖 , 𝑥 𝑗 ), we first calculate the normalized distance 𝐷 (𝑥 𝑖 , 𝑥 𝑗 ) between 𝑥 𝑖 and 𝑥 𝑗 in the original data space as:\n\nwhere 𝐷𝑖𝑠𝑡 (•, •) is a metric function used to measure the distance between sample pairs, and 𝑁𝑜𝑟𝑚(•) denotes min-max normalization. Based on the normalized distance 𝐷 (𝑥 𝑖 , 𝑥 𝑗 ), we then define a soft assignment 𝑤 (𝑥 𝑖 , 𝑥 𝑗 ) for each pair of samples (𝑥 𝑖 , 𝑥 𝑗 ) using the sigmoid function 𝜎 (𝑥) = 1/(1 + exp(-𝑥)):\n\nwhere 𝛼 ∈ [0, 1] is a boundary parameter that controls the upper bound of soft assignments. 𝜏 s is a sharpness parameter, where smaller values of 𝜏 s result in greater differences in 𝑤 (•, •) between  sample pairs, and vice versa. Figure  4  illustrates the differences between soft assignments 𝑤 (•, •) with different sharpness 𝜏 s .\n\nLeveraging the soft assignments for all sample pairs, we propose a soft contrastive loss to refine the traditional hard contrastive loss. Specifically, for a pair of projected embeddings (𝑧 𝑖 , 𝑧 𝑖 ), we first calculate the softmax probability of the relative similarity among all similarities as:\n\nwhere sim(•, •) refers to the cosine similarity, and 𝜏 c is a temperature parameter used to adjust the scale. Based on 𝑝 (𝑧 𝑖 , 𝑧 𝑖 ), the soft contrastive loss is then defined as:\n\nwhere X = 𝑋 ∪ 𝑋 represents the union of the data spaces of the original and masked samples. By assigning soft weights to different sample pairs, the model is encouraged to better capture the inherent correlations across different samples. During the training process, the final soft contrastive loss L C is computed by summing and averaging L C,𝑖 across all samples within a mini-batch. Notably, when ∀𝑤 (𝑥 𝑖 , 𝒙) = 0, the soft contrastive loss reduces to the traditional hard contrastive loss.",

      "section_name": "Aggregate Reconstruction",
      "text": "To further capture the fine-grained relationships between different samples, we incorporate an aggregator for weighted aggregation and reconstruction. Current approaches for masked EEG modeling typically reconstruct the masked portion based on the unmasked portion of a single masked sample  [20, 33] , following the learning paradigm of MAE  [12] . However, this single-sample reconstruction strategy overlooks the interactions between samples, leading to a complex and inadequate reconstruction process.\n\nTo overcome this limitation, we introduce a similarity-aware aggregator that improves the traditional single-sample reconstruction process. Specifically, we first calculate the cosine similarity between each pair of projected embeddings (𝑧 𝑖 , 𝑧 𝑗 ) within a mini-batch, resulting in a similarity matrix S. Based on the pairwise similarities in S, the aggregator then performs weighted aggregation of the embedding ℎ 𝑖 , defined as:\n\nwhere ℎ ′ ∈ H \\{ℎ 𝑖 } represents the encoded embedding corresponding to the projected embedding 𝑧 ′ , and H denotes the embedding space of the encoder 𝐸. This approach allows for a more comprehensive reconstruction by aggregating complementary information and incorporating similar features from different samples during the reconstruction process. Finally, the reconstructed embedding ℎ 𝑟 𝑖 is fed into a lightweight decoder 𝐷 to obtain the reconstructed sample 𝑥 𝑟 𝑖 . Following the masked modeling paradigm, we use Mean Squared Error (MSE) as the reconstruction loss for model optimization, which is defined as:\n\nSimilar to the soft contrastive loss L C , the final reconstruction loss L R is computed by summing and averaging L R,𝑖 across all samples within a mini-batch.",

We first conduct two experiments on the SEED and SEED-IV 3-category datasets: pre-training on SEED-IV and fine-tuning on SEED (SEED-IV 3 → SEED 3 ), and pre-training on SEED and fine-tuning on SEED-IV (SEED 3 → SEED-IV 3 ). In both experiments, all samples corresponding to fear emotions in the SEED-IV dataset are excluded.

Specifically, our model achieves classification accuracies of 91.61% and 87.24% with standard deviations of 7.56% and 8.35% in the SEED-IV 3 → SEED 3 and  3 experiments, outperforming the second-best method MAE by accuracies of 5.12% and 3.37%, respectively. In addition, the proposed SCMM is significantly better than transfer learning methods, highlighting its superiority.\n\n(2) Different-Class. We then conduct two experiments on the SEED and SEED-IV 4-category datasets, denoted as SEED-IV 4 → SEED 3 and SEED 3 → SEED-IV 4 . These experiments aim to evaluate the model performance when the pre-training and fine-tuning datasets contain different emotion categories. In the experiments, we exclude transfer learning methods since they are not suitable for scenarios where the training and testing datasets contain different emotion categories. Experimental results in the right two columns of Table  1  demonstrate that SCMM achieves the best performance in both experiments. Specifically, our model achieves classification accuracies of 91.26% and 80.89% with standard deviations of 7.91% and 8.69% in the SEED-IV 4 → SEED 3 and SEED 3 → SEED-IV 4 experiments, surpassing the second-best method MAE by 5.24% and 4.15% in accuracies, respectively. Additionally, the traditional CLbased models SimCLR, Mixup, TS-TCC, and JCFA exhibit relatively poor performance across all experiments due to their use of raw EEG signals as inputs.\n\nTo further validate the generalization capability of SCMM, we conduct additional experiments on the SEED and DEAP datasets, denoted as DEAP → SEED 3 , SEED 3 → DEAP (Valence), and SEED 3 → DEAP (Arousal). Note that the EEG acquisition equipment, emotional stimuli, data specifications, labeling approaches, and subjects are completely different between the two datasets. Table  2  presents the experimental results of SCMM compared to existing methods. Specifically, for the DEAP → SEED 3 experiment, SCMM achieves an accuracy of 91.70% with a standard deviation of 8.07%, outperforming the second-best method MAE by an accuracy of 8.01%. For the SEED 3 → DEAP (Valence) and SEED 3 → DEAP (Arousal) experiments, SCMM achieves classification accuracies of 73.96% and 72.66% with standard deviations of 6.75% and 5.67%, surpassing the second-best method MAE by 1.77% and 2.16% in accuracy. The results show that our model maintains excellent performance even when the pre-training and fine-tuning datasets are completely different, highlighting its superior generalization capability. Further, the comparative analysis of Table  1  and Table  2  reveals that the model performance of SCMM on the same fine-tuning dataset remains stable when pre-training on different datasets. This suggests that our model effectively captures generalizable emotional EEG representations that are robust to dataset variations.\n\nIn summary, extensive experimental results on SEED, SEED-IV, and DEAP confirm that our model exhibits superior performance and stability in cross-corpus EEG-based emotion recognition tasks under both same-class and different-class conditions.",

Specifically, we design three different models below. (1) w/o L C : the first configuration removes the soft contrastive loss and trains the model using only the reconstruction loss. The results show that the model performs the worst without the contrastive learning constraint. However, it still outperforms the MAE model based on the single-sample reconstruction paradigm. This suggests that our aggregate reconstruction strategy effectively improves the model performance by capturing fine-grained inter-sample relationships. (2) w/o L R : the second configuration removes the reconstruction loss and trains the model using only the soft contrastive loss. Experimental results show that this configuration outperforms the masked modeling approach, indicating that contrastive learning is more effective for EEG-based emotion recognition by capturing high-level semantic features of EEG signals.   configuration achieves the best performance in all experiments, indicating that SCMM significantly enhances the model performance and stability by combining soft contrastive learning and aggregate reconstruction. This improvement is evident under different cross-corpus conditions, demonstrating the feasibility of extending SCMM to real-life aBCI applications.",

Figure  7(a)  presents heat maps of pairwise similarity matrices, where darker colors indicate higher similarity between samples. Traditional hard CL identifies only coarse-grained relationships across samples from different emotion categories, especially for the most challengingto-recognize negative and neutral emotions.

Moreover, the results of t-SNE visualization in Fig.  7  6.5.2 Intra-and Inter-Class Similarities. To assess the quality of the embeddings learned by SCMM, we randomly select one subject from the SEED dataset and calculate both the average intra-and interclass cosine similarities between the learned embeddings of all test samples, as shown in Fig.  8 . It is evident that the proposed SCMM produces embeddings with higher intra-class similarity compared to traditional hard CL. In addition, the average inter-class similarity of the embeddings learned by SCMM is significantly lower than that of hard CL.

Unlike traditional CL-based models, SCMM integrates soft contrastive learning with a hybrid masking strategy to effectively capture the \"short-term continuity\" characteristics inherent in human emotions and produce stable and generalizable EEG representations. Additionally, a similarity-aware aggregator is introduced to fuse complementary information from semantically related samples, thereby enhancing the fine-grained feature representation capability of the model. Extensive experimental results on three well-recognized datasets show that SCMM consistently achieves SOTA performance in cross-corpus EEG-based emotion recognition tasks under both same-class and different-class conditions. Comprehensive ablation study and hyperparameter sensitivity analysis confirm the superiority and robustness of SCMM.\n\nVisualization results indicate that our model effectively reduces the distance between similar samples within the same category and captures more fine-grained relationships across samples.

These datasets encompass different EEG equipment, emotional stimuli, data specifications, labeling approaches, and subjects, making them exceptionally suitable for evaluating the model's efficacy in cross-corpus scenarios. Table  6  provides a detailed description of the three datasets.\n\n(1) SEED  [55]  was developed by the Center for Brain-like Computing and Machine Intelligence (BCMI) of Shanghai Jiao Tong University. The dataset used a 62-channel ESI NeuroScan System based on the international 10-20 system to record EEG signals from 15 subjects (7 males and 8 females) under different video stimuli at a sampling rate of 1 kHz. Each subject participated in 3 sessions. In each session, each subject was required to watch 15 movie clips consisting of 3 different emotional states: negative, neutral, and positive. Each emotional state contains a total of 5 movie clips, corresponding to 5 trials.\n\n(2) SEED-IV  [54]  used the same EEG equipment as the SEED dataset, but with different video stimuli, emotion categories, and subjects. The dataset recorded EEG signals from 15 subjects under different video stimuli at a sampling rate of 1 kHz. Each subject participated in 3 sessions. In each session, each subject was required to watch 24 movie clips containing 4 different emotions: sad, neutral, fear, and happy. Each emotion contains a total of 6 movie clips, corresponding to 6 trials. (3) DEAP  [19]  was constructed by Queen Mary University of London. The dataset has completely different acquisition device, emotional stimuli, data specifications, labeling approaches, experimental protocols, and subjects from the SEED-series datasets. Specifically, the DEAP dataset used a 128-channel Biosemi ActiveTwo System to record EEG signals from specific 32 channels of 32 subjects (16 males and 16 females) while watching 40 one-minute music videos at a sampling rate of 512 Hz. The 40 videos elicited different emotions according to the valence-arousal dimension. Specifically, the valence-arousal emotional model proposed by Russell  [36]  places each emotional state on a two-dimensional scale. The first dimension represents valence, ranging from negative to positive, and the second dimension represents arousal, ranging from calm to exciting. Participants rated valence and arousal using a continuous scale of 1 to 9 after watching each video clip.",

Then, the data were divided into multiple non-overlapping segments using a sliding window of 1s (SEED) and 4s (SEED-IV), respectively. After that, we extracted differential entropy (DE) features for each channel of each segment at five frequency bands: Delta (1-4 Hz), Theta (4-8 Hz), Alpha (8-14 Hz), Beta (14-31 Hz), and Gamma  (31) (32) (33) (34) (35) (36) (37) (38) (39) (40) (41) (42) (43) (44) (45) (46) (47) (48) (49) (50) . Finally, the DE features from 62 channels and 5 bands were formed into a feature matrix of shape 62 × 5, which serves as input to the SCMM model. The extraction of DE features can be expressed as:\n\nwhere 𝑒 is the Euler constant. 𝑥 is an EEG signal of a specific length that approximately obeys a Gaussian distribution 𝑁 (𝜇, 𝜎 2 ). Here, 𝜇 and 𝜎 are the mean and standard deviation of 𝑥, respectively. For the DEAP dataset, the raw EEG signals were initially downsampled to 128 Hz and denoised by a bandpass filter of 4-45 Hz. Subsequently, the data were segmented into multiple non-overlapping segments using a sliding window of 1s. Similar to the SEED and SEED-IV datasets, DE features were extracted for each channel of each segment at five frequency bands. Finally, the DE features from 32 channels and 5 bands were formed into a feature matrix of shape 32 × 5 as input to the model. In the experiments, we divided the continuous labels using a fixed threshold of 5 to convert them to binary classification tasks (low/high).",

Specifically, samples from one dataset are used for pre-training, while samples of each subject from another dataset are used individually for finetuning and testing. During the fine-tuning process, we use a leavetrials-out setting, where samples from a part of the trials in each session of each subject in the fine-tuning dataset are used for finetuning, and the remaining trials are used for testing.

      "text": "This paper introduces a novel hybrid masking strategy to generate diverse masked samples by considering both channel and feature relationships. To compare our approach with traditional masking strategies, we explore three different masking rules: random masking, channel masking, and hybrid masking. Figure  10  presents examples of generated masked samples using three strategies.\n\n• Random Masking: Generate masks using a binomial distribution to randomly mask samples along the feature dimension, setting the values of masked features to 0. • Channel Masking: Generate masks using a binomial distribution to randomly mask samples along the channel dimension, setting the values of all features within the masked channels to 0. • Hybrid Masking: Generate a probability matrix using a uniform distribution that proportionally mixes masks generated by random masking and channel masking. To assess the impact of various masking strategies, we conduct comparative experiments on the SEED and SEED-IV 3-category datasets using four strategies: random, channel, parallel, and hybrid masking. Specifically, the parallel masking strategy indicates that each sample is augmented randomly using one of the random masking or channel masking, and a threshold 𝜇 is used to control the probability of the two masking strategies being selected. Table  9  presents the experimental results, showing that the hybrid masking strategy achieves the highest accuracy and lowest standard deviation in both experiments. This suggests that the integration of different masking approaches significantly improves the model performance and stability. In addition, parallel masking increases the richness of augmented samples by combining different strategies, which is slightly better than using a single masking approach. However, this strategy makes the model training process unstable, resulting in large standard deviations. In summary, our proposed hybrid masking strategy is highly flexible and can be extended to various datasets by integrating multiple masking strategies using different ratios, which is exceptionally suitable for data with rich semantic information. This strategy effectively generates more diverse masked samples, encouraging the model to comprehensively capture the inherent relationships of the data.",
