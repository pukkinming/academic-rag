      "text": "In the pregnant mother and her fetus, chronic prenatal stress results in entrainment of the fetal heartbeat by the maternal heartbeat, quantified by the fetal stress index (FSI). Deep learning (DL) is capable of pattern detection in complex medical data with high accuracy in noisy real-life environments, but little is known about DL's utility in non-invasive biometric monitoring during pregnancy. A recently established self-supervised learning (SSL) approach to DL provides emotional recognition from electrocardiogram (ECG). We hypothesized that SSL will identify chronically stressed mother-fetus dyads from the raw maternal abdominal electrocardiograms (aECG), containing fetal and maternal ECG. Chronically stressed mothers and controls matched at enrolment at 32 weeks of gestation were studied. We validated the chronic stress exposure by psychological inventory, maternal hair cortisol and FSI. We tested two variants of SSL architecture, one trained on the generic ECG features for emotional recognition obtained from public datasets and another transfer-learned on a subset of our data. Our DL models accurately detect the chronic stress exposure group (AUROC=0.982±0.002), the individual psychological stress score (R2=0.943±0.009) and FSI at 34 weeks of gestation (R2=0.946±0.013), as well as the maternal hair cortisol at birth reflecting chronic stress exposure (0.931±0.006). The best performance was achieved with the DL model trained on the public dataset and using maternal ECG alone. The present DL approach provides a novel source of physiological insights into complex multi-modal relationships between different regulatory systems exposed to chronic stress. The final DL model can be deployed in low-cost regular ECG biosensors as a simple, ubiquitous early stress detection and monitoring tool during pregnancy. This discovery should enable early behavioral interventions.",

      "text": "Maternal chronic stress during pregnancy programs the fetal brain for altered developmental trajectories. We showed that in stressed mother-fetus dyads, this results in measurable synchronization of the fetal heartbeat by the maternal heartbeat, quantified by the fetal stress index (FSI)  [1] . Can this biophysical phenomenon be scaled to an easily deployable biomarker of chronic stress in pregnant mothers to help guide early interventions which can reverse altered fetal developmental trajectories?\n\nDeep learning (DL)-based approaches  [2]  to pattern detection in complex physiological data have shown high accuracy in noisy real-life environments  [3, 4] . Nonetheless, little is known about their utility in the setting of non-invasive biometrics obtained during human pregnancy.\n\nHere, we hypothesized that a DL approach to pattern recognition in maternal abdominal electrocardiograms (aECG) obtained in chronically stressed mothers and controls matched at enrolment at 32 weeks of gestation will detect chronic stress in mother-fetus dyads, i.e., a DL classification model (Figure  1 ).\n\nWe validated the exposure to stress by psychological inventory, molecular and biophysical biomarkers including maternal hair cortisol and FSI, respectively. Then, we tested the correlation between these exposure measures and the aECG and maternal ECG (mECG) features captured by the DL pipeline, i.e., DL regression model. We implemented the DL pipeline using the recently established self-supervised learning (SSL) approach that provides emotional recognition from ECG  [5, 6] .\n\nWe tested two variants of SSL architecture, one trained on the generic ECG features for emotion recognition obtained from public datasets and another transfer-learned on a subset of the composite aECG (which includes fetal ECG, fECG) or mECG data. Our studies of the model's performance in regression tasks and with or without the inclusion of the fetal ECG signal reveal a rich structure correlating to psychological, molecular, and biophysical biomarkers of maternal and fetal stress exposure at 34 weeks of gestation and at birth.",

ECG duration was more variable in the public dataset than in the FELICITy dataset and so was the sampling rate. However, it remains also uncertain whether this had any impact on the model performance, especially since all ECG was resampled at 256 Hz for the DL pipeline. It is possible that such variance in data quality and the composition of the participants made the model more robust, but  this conjecture would need to be tested in future work. We compared the model performance for detecting stressed mother-fetus dyads as well as predicting maternal hair cortisol, FSI, PDQ, and PSS values depending on two factors: the source of ECG (aECG, mECG) and the source of the trained model (learning from the FELICITy dataset -the first SSL approach, or transfer-learning from the public datasets -the second SSL approach) (Tables  2, 3 ).",

In comparison to the FELICITy dataset, training on the public dataset while using aECG improved performance across all metrics except the accuracy. Accuracy was excellent overall and stood out as not being influenced by the ECG source or the origin of the trained model. Again in comparison to the FELICITy dataset, training on the public dataset while using mECG also improved performance overall, except accuracy, PPV, and NPV. This was because mECG in general boosted the performance regardless of how the model was trained -on the FELICITy or the public datasets. The best group classification performance overall, across all metrics, was achieved using the public dataset and mECG.

      "text": "Recognizing the spread of PSS-10 scores, in the present study we also assessed the regression relationship between the scores and emotional recognition performance in our DL model (Table  3 ). The model performance results were similar for the regression analyses. We see overall similar improvements and best performance for all biomarkers when using mECG and the public dataset. When using the model trained on the FELICITy dataset, there was no difference in prediction for all biomarkers when using aECG or mECG. This suggests there is enough information in the mECG and the model trained on the FELICITy dataset. In contrast, using the model trained on the public dataset improved the performance regardless of the source of data, aECG or mECG.\n\nFor aECG on the FELICITy dataset, the model performed poorly for all biomarkers. Using mECG instead brought no significant improvement. When training on the public dataset, the performance improved on both aECG and mECG for cortisol, FSI, and PDQ, but not for PSS when using mECG, because it is already quite accurate when trained on the FELICITy dataset. In other words, the prediction of the PSS scores achieves highest performance when using the SSL pipeline trained on the FELICITy dataset and using mECG rather than the composite aECG, i.e., a signal containing maternal and fetal ECG combined.\n\nFor FSI and PDQ, it appears that the effect of the regression improvement by using the public dataset is dependent not on the biomarker, but on the data source, i.e., aECG versus mECG. This may be explained by the richer intrinsic structure of aECG compared to the uniquely maternal sourced mECG, which is better captured by the public dataset. The public dataset was also richer than the FELICITy dataset with regard to participants' gender composition, ECG sampling rate and duration (Table  1 ).\n\nOverall, using the raw aECG decreases the model performance on both classification and regression. Identification of the effects of chronic stress and a highly accurate prediction of its effects on cortisol, FSI, PDQ, and PSS is possible from maternal ECG alone using the SSL model trained on the public dataset and using FELICITy dataset does not improve this performance neither for classification nor for regression. This is visualized in Figure  2 .",

      "text": "Chronic stress is one of the most common modifiers of fetal and postnatal development with lifelong lasting effects on health and no systematic prevention programs exist today  [7, 8] . The present findings provide a solution. First, confirming our hypothesis, we report a scalable and readily deployable approach using an SSL model of DL to identify chronically stressed mother-fetus dyads and predict their biochemical, biophysical, and psychological characteristics from a regular mECG with a high degree of accuracy. The excellent performance of the model trained on the public dataset suggests a high probability of generalizability of our findings to new data. This is an important advance in early and non-invasive detection of chronic stress effects during pregnancy. The demonstration of mECG being sufficient translates into the ability of using conventional ECG devices which are widely available already. This will also enable wider utilization of ECG for studies of chronic stress effects on maternal, fetal, and postnatal health. Figure  3  demonstrates a possible deployment scenario made feasible by this work.\n\nAnother novel insight stems from two related observations. First, there was a high  degree of accuracy in predicting individual characteristics of the mother-fetus dyads related to chronic stress (cortisol, FSI, PDQ, and PSS). Second, an exploration of the neural network's latent space features suggests strongly that the entire ECG waveform structure is required and not only the temporal features of R-R peaks, i.e., heart rate variability (data not shown).\n\nThe deep neural network properties are important to consider for two reasons. First, there appears to be a rich intrinsic integrated information about these distinct physiological properties contained in ECG. This information is retained after the temporal order is destroyed by permutation of ECG waveforms as done in this work. To our knowledge, this is the first demonstration of such a relationship. Second, most presently available wearables do not record continuous ECG, but, rather, use photoplethysmography (PPG) sensors to track heart rate triggered from the pulse waveform. A new DL approach suggests that higher quality ECG signal can be derived from PPG using a generative adversarial network (GAN) architecture  [9] . Further research is needed to validate whether this may pave the way to using the present day wearables for identifying stress. Meanwhile, a next generation of wearables is capable of continuous on-body ECG monitoring  [10] , while some readily available clinical-grade ECG trackers can be deployed for this purpose already  [11] .\n\nOur study has limitations. First, the datasets are relatively small with less than 200 subjects in both the public and FELICITy datasets, yet the model performance has shown satisfactory stability. Also, these datasets are the largest known to us so far to permit such investigation. Second, we abstained from complicating our model with the addition of ancillary features such as BMI. It has been suggested that a bias may be added with such an approach that results from introducing unintended confounders in the causal inference sense, e.g., BMI may interact with ECG features or other features that interact with ECG in ways we don't know and the results may be biased or even meaningless as a result.\n\nIn conclusion, maternal-fetal early-life stress and its molecular and biophysical characteristics can be predicted with very good accuracy and reproducibility from regular ECG using a scalable SSL deep learning approach.",

Ethics approval was obtained from the Committee of Ethical Principles for Medical Research at the TUM (registration number 151/16S; ClinicalTrials.gov registration number NCT03389178). Briefly, in this prospective study, stressed mothers were matched with controls 1:1 for parity, maternal age, and gestational age at study entry. Recruited subjects were between 18 and 45 years of age, and were in their third trimester. The study ran for 22 months from July 2016 until May 2018, and subjects were selected from a cohort of pregnant women followed in the Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology at \"Klinikum rechts der Isar\" of the Technical University of Munich (TUM). This is a tertiary center of Perinatology located in Munich, Germany, which serves 2000 mothers/newborns per year. Figure  4  presents the recruitment flowchart for this dataset and the use of data in this study. Four exclusion criteria were applied, namely (a) serious placental alterations defined as fetal growth restriction according to Gordijn et al.  [12]   The Cohen Perceived Stress Scale questionnaire was administered to gauge chronic non-specific stress exposure (PSS-10)  [13] . PSS-10 ≥ 19 categorized subjects as stressed, as established  [1] . We applied inclusion-and exclusion criteria following returning the questionnaires. When a subject was categorized as stressed, the next screened participant matching for gestational age at recording with a PSS-10 score <19 was entered into the study as control. In addition to PSS-10, the participants received the German Version of the \"Prenatal Distress Questionnaire\" (PDQ) containing 12 questions on pregnancy related fears and worries regarding pregnancy related changes of the body weight and troubles, child's health, delivery and pregnancy's impact on the women's relationship.\n\nA transabdominal ECG (aECG) recording with a sampling rate of 900 Hz and a duration of at least 40 minutes was performed two and a half weeks after screening. The AN24 (GE HC/Monica Health Care, Nottingham, UK) was used. We calculated the signal quality index (SQI)  [14]  for aECG, in one-second windows, and subsequently discarded segments with an SQI of lower than 0.5. Using the fetal and maternal ECG deconvolution algorithm SAVER  [14] , we extracted fetal ECG (fECG) and maternal ECG (mECG). We utilized SQI to discard the noisy data resulting in the averaged duration of mECG and aECG of 46.07±8.74 minutes, whereas the average duration of fECG was 3.25±7.83 minutes. Due to its short duration, we could not utilize the extracted fECG data to train our self-supervised model and continued with aECG and mECG signals only. However, please note that aECG signal does represent a composite signal containing fECG and mECG, so DL on this signal tells us something about the fECG features. We refer to the resulting ECG dataset containing aECG and mECG as the FELICITy dataset.\n\nWe detected the fetal R-peaks and the maternal R-peaks separately from the respective fECG and mECG signals. The fetal-and maternal RR interval time-series were subsequently derived from the fetal and maternal R-peaks. We then calculated the mean fetal heart rate (fHR) and mean maternal heart rate (mHR) values.\n\nUpon delivery of the baby, we recorded the clinical data including birth weight, length, and head circumference, pH, and Apgar score. Maternal cortisol was assessed using established methodology  [15] [16] [17] .",

      "text": "To analyze the relationship between two signals recorded synchronously, mHR and fHR, we use the bivariate phase rectified signal averaging (BPRSA) method  [18] . This method extends the \"monovariate\" PRSA method proposed for the analysis of fHR  [19, 20] .\n\nThe two signals in question in this study are the mHR (trigger signal) and the fHR (target signal). The BPRSA algorithm operates by first detecting a number of anchor points A, defined as decreases in mHR. Next, for the detected set of A, we interpolate the fHR with a sampling rate of 900 Hz to match the maternal ECG. We then detect the time of the anchor points in fHR, which we denote by A . Then, around each anchor point A in fHR, a window of length (2L) is selected. In this paper, we set L = 9000, resulting in a window of 20 seconds. Next, by aligning the anchor points, we obtain phase-rectified segments. The resultant segments are then averaged to obtain BPRSA signal X. Consequently, we can interpret defections in X as coupling between mHR and fHR. Lastly, X is quantified within specific windows before and after the center of X. Accordingly, the designated windows are characterized as L + S1 to L + S2, and L -S2 to L -S1, where S1 and S2 are the indices used for this quantification step. We set S1 = 1350 and S2 = 2250, which results in windows of 1.5 and 2.5 seconds, given our sampling rate of 900 Hz.\n\nFetal stress index (FSI) is a parameter defined to analyze the coupling between mHR and fHR using the BPRSA. This index is defined as the difference between the means of the two windows mentioned above, as follows:\n\nwhere index L at the center of X corresponds to our anchor definition (within the maternal RR intervals). Accordingly, the response of the fetus on mHR decreases is measured by FSI.",

Second Approach -Transfer Learning From Public Datasets: In order to explore the generalizability of the self-supervised learning, we used 4 publicly available datasets namely, AMIGOS  [21] , DREAMER  [22] , SWELL  [23] , and WESAD  [24]  to train the signal transformation recognition network, i.e., learn ECG representations.

This resulted in removing approximately 4.1% of total acquired data with a standard deviation of 8.8. In other words, approximately 50 minutes (46.07±8.74) of ECG data from each participant were used.\n\nWe divided our whole dataset into training and test sets using a 5-fold cross-validation technique as follows.
