      "text": "As a vital aspect of affective computing, Multimodal Emotion Recognition has been an active research area in the multimedia community. Despite recent progress, this field still confronts two major challenges in real-world applications: 1) improving the efficiency of constructing joint representations from unaligned multimodal features, and 2) relieving the performance decline caused by random modality feature missing. In this paper, we propose a unified framework, Modality-Collaborative Transformer with Hybrid Feature Reconstruction (MCT-HFR), to address these issues. The crucial component of MCT is a novel attention-based encoder which concurrently extracts and dynamically balances the intra-and inter-modality relations for all associated modalities. With additional modality-wise parameter sharing, a more compact representation can be encoded with less time and space complexity. To improve the robustness of MCT, we further introduce HFR which consists of two modules: Local Feature Imagination (LFI) and Global Feature Alignment (GFA). During model training, LFI leverages complete features as supervisory signals to recover local missing features, while GFA is designed to reduce the global semantic gap between pairwise complete and incomplete representations. Experimental evaluations on two popular benchmark datasets demonstrate that our proposed method consistently outperforms advanced baselines in both complete and incomplete data scenarios.

      "text": "Multimodal Emotion Recognition (MER) is aimed at recognizing and comprehending human emotional states from video clips by leveraging data primarily from three channels: audio (vocal expressions/prosody), vision (facial expressions/gestures), and text (spoken words). With the unprecedented advances of social media in recent years, MER has gained increasing attention owing to various promising applications, such as user preference analysis  [47] , mental health care  [2] , and more empathetic chatting machine  [75] . Existing works have explored numerous approaches to fully utilize the complementary information across available modalities in a relatively simple and static multimedia environment  [1] . However, the real-world scenarios are far more complicated, posing great challenges to MER.\n\nOn the one hand, the multimodal features are naturally unaligned due to the varying sampling rates of involved modalities. One paradigm for handling unaligned multimodal sequences is to first summarize each modality into a high-level representation by collapsing the time dimension. Afterwards, the cross-modal interactions are modeled using different fusion mechanisms, such as tensor-based operation  [65]   [36] , factorized subspace learning  [57]   [27] , or deep canonical correlation analysis  [54]   [73] . Albeit, these methods fail to capture the temporal multimodal dynamics. For example, a frown and some upset words may appear at the same time, while a sigh may appear at the end of the utterance. To this end, several works  [12] [66]  [67]   [35]  propose to integrate the temporal and cross-modal interactions at each time step of Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs). The limitation of these methods is the requirement to explicitly align multimodal signals to the equivalent sampling rate in advance, adding extra manual labeling costs. Inspired by the power of Transformer  [60] , researchers have looked into ways to implicitly align multimodal sequences during model training  [56] [64]  [38]   [25] . Most of these models are built upon the combination of independent self-attention and cross-attention reinforcement units introduced in  [56] . However, fusing multimodal sequences in this directional pairwise manner is inefficient due to limited modality interactions and duplicated model parameters.\n\nOn the other hand, the multimodal signals are frequently contaminated in real-world applications. For instance, the voice may be lost due to the speaker's silence or background noise, the text may be unavailable due to automatic speech recognition errors, and the faces may be invisible due to visual blur or occlusion. These phenomenons are collectively referred to as Random Modality Feature Missing (RMFM) in this paper. When the RMFM problem arises, existing MER models that are trained on ideal samples typically experience a severe performance decline. To address this issue, researchers have explored different strategies to recover the semantics of missing modalities, including missing modality imputation  [39]   [26] , generative methods  [55]   [19]   [71] , and translationbased methods  [46] [74]  [70] . The main idea of these approaches is to discover the correlations across modalities, then try to impute the information of missing modalities on the basis of available modalities. Despite the advancements, these techniques mainly focus on situations where one or two modalities are entirely absent. In practice, modality missing problem usually occurs at part of the time steps in multimodal sequential signals. In recent years, several approaches  [34]   [33] [64]  [53]  have been proposed to handle the fine-grained modality feature missing problem. However, these works are centered around the scenario where the probabilities of feature missing in training and testing data are comparable. As a result, different models need to be built for varying feature missing rates.\n\nMotivated by the above observations, we propose Modality-Collaborative Transformer with Hybrid Feature Reconstruction (MCT-HFR), a unified framework for efficient and robust MER in realworld scenarios with uncertain feature missing rates. We first design the Modality-Collaborative Transformer (MCT) for efficient representation learning from unaligned multimodal input. The key innovation of MCT is the Multimodal Re-scaled Attention Unit (MRAU), which takes multiple feature sequences as input and directly returns the reinforced counterparts. All modalities in MRAU are dynamically re-scaled with respect to sequence lengths and arranged into a hyper-modality to acquire modality-collaborative information. The hyper-modality is utilized to reinforce each modality via cross-modal attention. Moreover, MRAU can be stacked multiple times to deepen the interactions across modalities. Compared with the predominant Transformer-based models, MCT avoids the inefficient directional pairwise attention modeling and the repeated parameters of feature projection for the same modality. On the basis of MCT, we introduce the Hybrid Feature Reconstruction (HFR) to further strengthen the model robustness towards incomplete data scenarios. During model training, we apply a dynamic temporal masking on the complete sequences to simulate the RMFM cases, and utilize HFR to reconstruct the missing features. Specifically, HFR consists of two modules: 1) the Local Feature Imagination (LFI) is designed to reproduce the local missing elements of the input sequences leveraging the reinforced modality features, while 2) the Global Feature Alignment (GFA) is designed to align the the global semantics summarized from the complete and incomplete views of multimodal input. Consequently, HFR tries to capture the feature missing patterns from two diverse perspectives, which can further complement each other. The superiority of our proposed framework is verified by extensive experiments on different multimodal emotion recognition benchmarks, IEMOCAP  [8]  and MSP-IMPROV  [9] , with both complete and incomplete testing data.\n\nThe main contributions of this paper can be summarized as follows:\n\n• We propose MCT to promote the efficiency of representation learning from unaligned multimodal sequences. With lower time and space complexity, MCT can achieve better performance over existing Transformer-based models. • We propose HFR to strengthen the robustness of MCT in real-world scenarios with uncertain feature missing rates. HFR is intended to reconstruct the missing semantics from both the local and global perspectives to stabilize the representation learning from incomplete multimodal sequences. • Experiments on two benchmark datasets demonstrate that our proposed MCT-HFR outperforms several state-of-the-art models in both complete and incomplete data scenarios, highlighting the efficacy of MCT-HFR for practical applications.\n\nThe remainder of this paper is organized as follows: Section 2 reviews the previous related work. Section 3 formalizes the problem statement and introduces the vanilla attention units. Section 4 describes the overall workflow and detailed components of our proposed method. Section 5 introduces the experimental datasets and setup in detail. Section 6 presents the experimental results and analysis. Finally, Section 7 concludes this work and discusses the future research directions.",

      "text": "Since humans can express their emotions in a variety of ways, including through tone of voice, facial expressions, and verbal language, it is expected that combining data from several modalities will be more effective than unimodal approaches  [48] . The multimodal fusion approaches can be broadly categorized into three levels: 1) feature-level fusion, 2) model-level fusion, and 3) decision-level fusion. Generally, feature-level fusion concatenates the time-aligned features at the front end to build up the mutlimodal input  [51] [41]  [21] , while decision-level fusion performs inference based on each modality and subsequently combines the predictions from all modalities  [68]  [24]  [44] . Nevertheless, these two types of fusion methods fail to explicitly model cross-modal interactions. Therefore, various modern fusion strategies have been centered around model-level fusion in the past few years. One line of research utilized independent encoders to extract high-level representations of different modalities prior to feature fusion  [65] [36]  [27]  [57]  [54]  [73] . For instance, Hazarika et al.  [27]  factorize modalities into complementary subspaces to construct a comprehensive multimodal representation. To further capture fine-grained interactions across modalities, a variety of approaches have been proposed, such as multi-view RNN networks  [12] [66][67]  [35]  and multimodal word embeddings  [61]  [50]  [58] . Despite the advancements, the requirement for timealigned features is a bottleneck for these methods in practical use. More recently, Transformer-based methods  [56]    [32] [64]  [38] [25]  [15]  have gained increasing popularity because of their capacity to fuse unaligned multimodal features directly. For example, Tsai et al.  [56]  propose the modality reinforcement unit to repeatedly reinforce a target modality with information from a source modality by learning the directional pairwise attention. Lv et al.  [38]  introduce a message hub to exchange information with each modality, then iteratively update the common message and the involved modality features. Based on the message hub, Sun et al.  [53]  further reduced the time complexity via local-global partial attention mechanism. Compared with existing approaches that build upon the combination of vanilla attention units, our proposed MCT optimizes the attention mechanism specifically for multimodal input, reinforcing the associated modalities collaboratively in a single layer with less time and space complexity.",

      "text": "While enormous approaches have been proposed to improve MER in the context of ideal data, the generalization of MER in real-world scenarios has yet to be investigated. Based on the assumption for data imperfection, previous works can be generally categorized into two groups: 1) modality missing, and 2) modality feature missing. The former one considers the situations where one or two modalities are entirely absent in the testing phase. In recent years, several approaches have been explored to handle this problem  [22] [39]  [26] [71]  [46] [74]  [70] . For instance, Pham et al.  [46]  propose a robust representation learning strategy leveraging cyclic translations from source to target modalities. Moreover, Zeng et al.  [70]  incorporate a tag encoding module with common space projection to address the issue of uncertain missing modalities. In contrast, modality feature missing considers a more general situation where partial time steps of sequential features are missing. Under this assumption, Liang et al.  [34]  develop a low-rank regularization based model for time-aligned multimodal sequences, and Li et al.  [33]  further improve the model by exploiting the temporal-wise dynamics of data with less space complexity. More recently, Yuan et al.  [64]  propose a Transformerbased model with sequential feature reconstruction for unaligned multimodal sequences, and Sun et al.  [53]  integrate the former low-level feature reconstruction with high-level feature attraction to enhance the model robustness. Although intriguing, these techniques require distinct models to be trained for various feature missing rates, which limits the models' generalization ability. In contrast, this work attempts to build one unified framework with superior robustness against uncertain feature missing patterns. In the training phase, the incomplete multimodal features are dynamically generated, and the complete view of multimodal input is referenced for the reconstruction of missing features.",

By setting up the appropriate pretext tasks, SSL methods enable models to learn the inherent structure or patterns present in unlabeled data. For example, masked prediction is designed to learn meaningful contextualized representations by predicting the masked elements of data, e.g., word embeddings  [18] [17], quantized speech units  [4]   [31] , and discretized visual tokens  [49][6] . Contrastive learning is another approach to learn semantically rich yet discriminative representations by bringing similar samples closer and separating diverse samples apart  [14] [72]  [62] . Generally, the pre-trained models can be used as seed models and then optimized for downstream tasks. Moreover, Hendrycks et al.  [30]  reveal that substantial regularization may be achieved by integrating self-supervision and full supervision, which enhances robustness and uncertainty estimation. Inspired by the power of SSL, our proposed HFR sets up a pretext task as an auxiliary supervision, which reconstructs the missing semantics of incomplete multimodal sequences from both the local and global perspectives. The pretext task is trained jointly with the major classification task.",

However, the simple concatenation of unaligned sequences may lead to inferior performance. For each modality 𝑚, the feature length 𝑇 𝑚 is variable with a maximum length of 𝑇 max 𝑚 during training. On the one hand, the attention scores are calculated collaboratively across all modalities. Due to the varied sampling rate of different modalities, the longer sequence of a certain modality may be assigned with larger accumulated attention weights, degrading the importance of other modalities.

First of all, we perform the quantitative experiments and evaluate different approaches in both complete and incomplete data scenarios. Table  2  and Table  3  present the experimental results on the IEMOCAP and MSP-IMPROV datasets, respectively. For fair comparison, these models can be divided into: traditional MER models using \"conventional complete training\" strategy (G-I), MER models designed for modality feature missing using \"oneto-one training\" strategy (G-II), and our proposed MCT-HFR with all the three training strategies (G-III). Note that MCT-HFR is equivalent to MCT when using the \"conventional complete training\" strategy. From the experimental results, we conclude the following observations: 1) Compared with the models in G-I, our proposed MCT outperforms currently advanced approaches on both datasets. For the complete testing data, MCT exceeds the best performing baselines by 1.32%/1.39% UA and 0.45%/1.17% UF1 on the IEMOCAP/MSP-IMPROV datasets, respectively. For the incomplete testing data, a similar conclusion can be drawn. We attribute these promising results to the collaborative modality reinforcement in MCT, which promotes the efficiency of modeling interactions across modalities and fastens the convergence of representation learning.\n\n2) Compared with the models in G-II, our proposed MCT-HFR outperforms the state-of-the-art models using the same training strategy on both datasets. For the incomplete testing data, MCT-HFR surpasses the suboptimal model, EMT-DLFR, by the AUILC values of 0.42%/0.66% UA, 0.55%/0.79% UF1 and 0.52%/0.72% WF1 on the IEMOCAP/MSP-IMPROV datasets, respectively. Furthermore, we plot the curves of detailed performance with respect to various missing rates in Fig.  3  and Fig.  4 . As the missing rate increases, the performance decline of our method is smaller than the others. Taking the results on IEMOCAP for example, as the missing rate increases from 0.0 to 0.9, the performance of baselines decreases by 11.07%~29.54% UA and 11.57%~30.04% UF1, while Table  2 .

It is interesting that MCT-HFR ★ can achieve even better performance than MCT-HFR † for most metrics on the complete testing data. This phenomenon is highly related to the \"dynamic incomplete training\" strategy. In some aspects, this strategy is similar to data augmentation, which may alleviate the overfitting problem when the dataset (IEMOCAP and MSP-IMPROV) is relatively  To further investigate the efficiency of our proposed MCT-HFR, we measure the computational complexity via the metrics of trainable parameters and multiply-accumulate operations (MACs)  4  . We perform the calculations on a random generated multimodal instance with (𝑇 𝑎 ,𝑇 𝑣 ,𝑇 𝑙 ) equal to (400, 40, 50) and report the results in Table  4 . For fair comparison, the hyper-parameters of attention units are kept in line (4 layers and 4 attention heads with 32 nodes in each head) across the Transformer-based models. For TFR-Net, EMT-DLFR, and MCT-HFR, the feature reconstruction networks are omitted during inference. From the experimental results, we conclude the following observations: 1) We first compare the computational complexity of different fusion networks consisted of one layer. From Table  4 , we find that each layer of MCT-HFR (i.e., an MRAU in Section 4.1) enjoys the least trainable parameters (3× less than TFR-Net and 2× less than EMT-DLFR) and MACs (3× less than TFR-Net and slightly less than EMT-DLFR). Specifically, MulT and TFR-Net are based on directional pairwise attention modeling, requiring 𝑀 (𝑀 -1) and 𝑀 2 attention-based reinforcement units for 𝑀 modalities, respectively. Although PMR reduces the reinforcement units to 2𝑀, this model constructs a new hyper-modality as the message hub and iteratively updates it along with the original modalities, resulting in the highest MACs. On the basis of PMR, EMT-DLFR reduced the time complexity via local-global partial attention mechanism. In contrast, our proposed MCT-HFR further narrows the reinforcement units to 𝑀, and the projected keys, queries, and values of each modality are shared for later modality reinforcements in the same layer. Additionally, MCT-HFR dynamically builds a hyper-modality via a parameter-free re-scaling mechanism and regards it as the source modality. As a result, the trainable parameters and MACs of MCT-HFR can be consistently lowered.\n\n2) Subsequently, we look into the results of overall models (basically including the unimodal encoders, multimodal fusion networks, pooling layers, and classifiers). Note that we exclude the pre-trained feature extractors. In MulT and TFR-Net, an extra computational complexity of selfattention is introduced for aggregating the repeatedly reinforced representations of each modality, which is not required in MCT-HFR. During model training, the feature reconstruction networks can increase the computational cost of TFR-Net, EMT-DLFR, and MCT-HFR. Compared with TFR-Net, the trainable parameters and MACs of MCT-HFR drop by 61.5% and 55.8%. Compared with EMT-DLFR, the higher MACs of MCT-HFR are due to the more sophisticated Transformer-based decoders in LFI. During model inference, MCT-HFR also achieves the lowest computational cost at the model level, with 2× less trainable parameters and slightly less MACs than the sub-optimal model.",

As illustrated in Section 4.1, the re-scaling factors 𝛾 𝑏 and 𝛾 𝑒 are introduced in constructing the keys of hyper-modality. The motivation is to address the issue of modality imbalance and attention dispersion caused by excessively long concatenated sequences. To fully investigate the effects of the re-scaling factors, we ablate 𝛾 𝑏 and 𝛾 𝑒 respectively, then evaluate the models on the testing data split by different duration intervals. As shown in Table  5 , the models' performances generally increase as the duration grows due to more comprehensive contextual information. However, we can observe a performance decline from \"6~8 s\" to \">8 s\" for   The experimental results of different models are shown in Fig.  5 . We observe that both MCT-GFA and MCT-LFI exhibit performance gain over MCT, proving that the feature reconstruction from both local and global perspectives can improve the basic recognition ability and model robustness against feature missing. Specifically, MCT-GFA outperforms MCT-LFI on the complete testing data, while MCT-LFI surpasses MCT-GFA on the incomplete testing data. We believe that GFA can better capture the global semantics at relatively lower feature missing rates, while LFI can effectively relieve the performance decline as the missing rate grows. Consequently, MCT-HFR achieves the best performing by combining these two complementary modules together. For better comparison, we also present the results of TFR-Net and EMT-DLFR in Fig.  5 .

Compared with the other three distance metrics, CMD exhibits the great advantage for enhancing the model robustness. Among the four metrics, smooth L1 loss turns out to be the worst performing metric, mainly due to the excessive constraint on the global semantic spaces. Besides, we conjecture that the relatively poor performance of cosine similarity can be due to the potential risk of shortcut learning  [20] . While JSD is based on mean (first raw moment) matching of statistical moments, CMD can explicitly match the higher order moments of the view-specific distributions. In this way, CMD helps to align the global semantics more comprehensively. Fig.  6 . Ablation results for the distance metrics of GFA on the IEMOCAP dataset.

By collaborative modality reinforcements, MCT can surpass the most advanced Transformer-based models with noticeably less space and time complexity. During model training, HFR is introduced as an auxiliary supervision to further enhance the robustness of MCT from both the local and global perspectives. Experimental results on two benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our method.
