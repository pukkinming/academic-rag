      "text": "The performance of speech emotion recognition (SER) is limited by the insufficient emotion information in unimodal systems and the feature alignment difficulties in multimodal systems. Recently, multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have made progress in SER. However, MLLMs still suffer from hallucination and misclassification problems in complex emotion reasoning. To address these problems, we propose an MLLM-based framework called EmoQ, which generates query embeddings that fuse multimodal information through an EmoQ-Former and uses multi-objective affective learning (MAL) to achieve co-optimization. The framework also provides a soft-prompt injection strategy to inject multimodal representations into the LLM. This end-to-end architecture achieves state-of-the-art performance on the IEMOCAP and MELD datasets, providing a new multimodal fusion paradigm for SER.",

      "text": "Speech emotion recognition (SER) realizes automatic recognition of speakers' emotional states by parsing the emotional features in speech signals. However, the single modality approach has intrinsic limitations: due to the ambiguity in the definition of emotion, coupled with the complexity of linguistic expressions, it is difficult to adequately capture emotion cues at the semantic level by relying on acoustic information alone.\n\nAudio-based SER often lacks semantic reasoning, leading to erroneous judgments. In real-world scenarios, speech signals can be accompanied by text transcriptions through automatic speech recognition (ASR), providing a basis for multimodal fusion. Recent studies have shown that the audio-text multimodal architecture can improve the performance of emotion recognition  [11, 20] . Text information can provide semantic complements to audio features, and multimodal fusion has become a key to improve SER performance.\n\nDespite the performance gains from multimodal fusion, several critical challenges remain. First, cross-modal alignment presents a fundamental challenge  [2] . Audio signals exhibit continuous temporal dynamics, whereas transcribed texts comprise sequences of discrete tokens, creating temporal misalignment that impedes acousticsemantic modeling. Second, modal imbalance emerges during multimodal training, where one modality tends to dominate the optimization process. Third, feature space heterogeneity poses integration difficulties  [29] . How exciting.\n\nFig.  1 . The EmoQ framework employs an end-to-end multimodal learning approach that utilizes an LLM for emotion classification.\n\nAs multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have demonstrated their capabilities in multimodal reasoning  [2, 6, 30] , researchers have started to apply them to SER. For example, SALMO-NN  [27]  uses a dual-encoder architecture combined with Q-Former  [2]  and LoRA  [3]  to achieve audio-text alignment. SECap  [28]  further explores the possibility of using LLMs for speech emotion captioning. The authors of LLM-CL  [22]  proposed a zero-shot multilingual speech emotion recognition framework based on contrastive learning. These MLLMs achieve performance gains on SER benchmarks, demonstrating the potential of the MLLM architectures for speech emotion understanding.\n\nInspired by the aforementioned works, we propose EmoQ as shown in Fig.  1 . EmoQ addresses the challenges in SER through three innovations:\n\n1) EmoQ provides a cross-modal alignment mechanism, where the EmoQ-Former achieves speech-to-text feature fusion through learnable queries and attention masks to overcome temporal misalignment and feature space heterogeneity.\n\n2) EmoQ employs a multi-objective affective learning (MAL) framework that combines supervised contrastive learning  [9]  and focal loss  [4]  for co-optimization.\n\n3) EmoQ introduces a soft-prompt injection strategy to replace the <AUDIO> token in the prompt with fused representations, enabling the LLM to simultaneously utilize both language comprehension and cross-modal emotion cues for inference.",

For the audio modality a, we use the pretrained HuBERT model  [1]  to extract the audio embeddings Ea ∈ R La×da , where La is the number of audio frames and da is the feature dimension. We map the audio embeddings to E ′ a ∈ R La×d h by a linear projection layer, aligned with the hidden dimension d h of the query vectors. For the corresponding transcribed text t, we use a tokenizer to convert it to a text embedding sequence Et ∈ R L t ×d h , where Lt is the number of tokens.\n\nWe concatenate the learned query vectors Q ∈ R Nq ×d h with the text embeddings Et to form a joint sequence X:\n\nThis sequence is processed by a self-attention mechanism such that the query vectors and text embeddings can attend to each other, allowing the query vectors to absorb the semantic information. Specially, we have:\n\nwhere WQ, WK , and WV are the weight matrices of the selfattention mechanism, and d k is the dimension of the key vectors. Next, we feed the matrix Q ′ ∈ R Nq ×d h , which is the query portion of the self-attended matrix Aself, into the cross-attention module, allowing the vectors in this portion to attend to the projected audio embeddings E ′ a :\n\nwhere WQ,cross, WK,cross, and WV,cross are the weight matrices of the cross-attention, and M ∈ R Nq ×La is an attention mask matrix to handle variable-length audio sequences. Specifically, M1:N q ,j = 1 if the time position j corresponds to valid audio content; otherwise, M1:N q ,j = 0 to accommodate padded time positions beyond the actual audio length. We then present the cross-attended vectors {Across,i} Nq i=1 ∈ R d h to a feed forward network (FFN), followed by passing the resulting vectors to an attentive pooling layer with multiple attention heads to obtain eq. Finally, we apply L2-norm to normalize eq to obtain the final embedding e ′ q .",

Supervised contrastive loss leverages the label information to reinforce the principle that samples of the same class will be close to each other in the representation space and that samples from different classes will be far apart. It enhances the quality of the feature representation by using a variant of InfoNCE loss:\n\nwhere ei denotes the L2-normalized cross-modal feature vector e ′ q in Fig.  2  for the i-th sample in a mini-batch of size N . P (i) contains the indexes of positive samples with the same emotion label as sample i, A(i) contains the indexes of all samples in the batch except sample i, and τ is a temperature parameter.\n\nTo solve the category imbalance problem in emotion classification, we use the focal loss to reduce the contribution of easyto-categorize samples and enhance the learning weights of difficult samples. For each sample i with embedding ei and true label yi ∈ {1, ..., C} where C is the number of emotion classes, we compute the logits zi ∈ R C through a classification head to obtain the posterior probability vector pi ∈ R C . The focal loss is computed as:\n\nwhere pi,y i is the yi-th element of pi, αy i ∈ [0, 1] is the precomputed weight for class yi, and γ is the focus parameter.\n\nMAL achieves the enhancement of emotion information by multi-objective learning:\n\nwhere λ is a balancing factor.",

We then design a structured prompt template that instructs the LLM to act as an emotion recognition system. The user input section contains the speaker information (if available), the transcribed text, and the multimodal features represented by a special <AUDIO> placeholder. The template also concludes with an assistant response format that begins with \"Emotion:\" to ensure consistent output generation. Fig.  2  (right panel) gives an example of the prompt template. Before feeding the text into the LLM, we replace the embedding vector of the <AUDIO> placeholder with the projected vector e h .\n\nWe define the fine-tuning process of the LLM as a standard autoregressive language modeling task.

At this stage, we freeze the parameters of the pre-trained HuBERT. The output e ′ q of the EmoQ-Former is fed into a lightweight auxiliary MLP for emotion classification. The EmoQ-Former and the auxiliary MLP head are optimized by our proposed MAL (Eq. 6). After training, we save the weights of EmoQ-Former and discard the auxiliary MLP head.\n\nIn the second stage, we load the EmoQ-Former's weights pretrained in the first stage. Then, the EmoQ-Former is connected to the projector and the LLM to constitute the complete end-to-end model in Fig.  2 . We use Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA)  [3]  for fine-tuning of the LLM, where the parameters of the EmoQ-Former and projector are co-trained with the LoRA parameters of the LLM.

This demonstrates the effectiveness of EmoQ-Former in cross-modal feature fusion.\n\nWe analyzed the contribution of each component in the MAL framework to the model performance, as detailed in Table  5 . Both focal loss and SCL individually improve performance over the baseline, with focal loss being particularly effective against the class imbalance of the MELD dataset. The full MAL configuration combining both losses achieves the best performance.\n\nThe effectiveness of the two-stage training strategy is verified by comparing the end-to-end training against the two-stage training, as shown in Table  6 . End-to-end training (1st row) directly optimizes the full model, whereas two-stage training (2nd row) pre-trains the EmoQ-Former via an auxiliary MLP head followed by LLM finetuning.
