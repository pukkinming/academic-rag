      "text": "Speech emotion recognition (SER) serves as a foundational component in applications such as conversational agents, contact center analytics, healthcare, and education. However, real-world deployment often faces significant distributional shifts due to variations in speakers, languages, devices, ambient noise, or even inconsistent label taxonomies. As a result, models that perform well in-domain often degrade substantially on out-of-domain (OOD) test scenarios  [1] .\n\nTest-time adaptation (TTA)  [2]  adapts models during inference using only unlabeled target data, without source access. Early methods tune class-specific prompts with a few target labels for alignment  [3, 4] . Later approaches remove labels but rely on gradientbased updates to learn prompts or adapters from unlabeled test batches  [5, 6] . Recent training-free methods eliminate all optimization by using heuristics or retrieval to improve robustness  [7, 8] . However, these methods still assume access to a batch of samples and introduce computational overhead during inference. While effective, most require batch-mode access and tuning at inference, limiting their use in practical applications.\n\nWhile test-time adaptation has recently gained traction in speech, particularly for ASR  [9, 10] , via unsupervised objectives, pseudo-labeling, and low-rank parameter tuning, its extension to SER remains relatively limited. Compared to ASR, SER exhibits greater speaker variability, emotional ambiguity, and weaker linguistic structure, posing unique adaptation challenges. Compounding this, many existing TTA methods rely on test batches  [9] , model updates  [10] , or prompt tuning  [3] , making them unsuitable when access to training sources or buffered inputs is severely restricted. This highlights the growing need for lightweight, training-free adaptation approaches that avoid parameter updates.\n\nTo address these challenges, we propose Emo-TTA, a trainingfree test-time adaptation method that integrates audio language models (ALMs)  [11, 12]  with a test time Expectation-Maximization (EM)  [13]  procedure. Emo-TTA is designed to meet three key requirements: (i) Test-time distribution estimation, by maintaining class-conditional statistics over the incoming test samples to inform predictions; (ii) Lightweight adaptation, by avoiding access to source data, model updates, or multi-sample buffering; and (iii) Training-free inference, without prompt tuning or retraining. Specifically, we model each class-conditional density p(x | y = i) ∼ N (µi, Σi) with prior πi, and predict using Bayes rule: ŷ = arg maxi p(x | y = i) p(y = i). Initialization sets µi from ALM-derived text prompts and uses simple priors πi. At each time step t, the E-step computes soft assignments γt,i ∝ πi N (xt | µi, Σi), and the M-step incrementally updates {µi, Σi, πi} from {γt,i, xt}. This yields continuous, single-sample adaptation without modifying the model or storing past test data.\n\nIn summary, our main contributions are: (i) To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to simultaneously satisfy the three core requirements of TTA in ALMs, namely Test-time distribution estimation, lightweight adaptation, and training-free inference, thereby enabling efficient and practical adaptation for SER. (ii) We introduce Emo-TTA, a EM-based method that incrementally updates class-conditional statistics based on ALM-derived textual prototypes, enabling continuous adaptation without accessing source data, modifying model weights, or storing test samples. (iii) Extensive experiments on six out-of-domain SER benchmarks show that Emo-TTA consistently improves performance, highlighting its robustness across acoustic domains.",

In contrast, our training-free test-time approach enables lightweight adaptation, improving practical feasibility under real-world constraints.\n\n2.2. Test-Time Adaptation (TTA) for ALMs.\n\nIn the TTA setting, an audio-language model pre-trained on a source domain is adapted to a target speech emotion recognition (SER) domain using only unlabeled test audio Dtest = {at}, with predictions made independently at inference. To improve CLAP's performance under distribution shift, prior TTA methods aggregate predictions over multiple audio augmentations via entropy-based filtering:\n\nwhere Am(at) is the m-th augmented view of utterance at, ρ is the selected proportion of low-entropy views, and H(•) denotes entropy over K emotion classes. Despite promising results, existing approaches face limitations: (1) they neglect modeling the underlying emotion distribution, overlooking the structure among test utterances; (2) they rely on access to multiple samples or memory caches, incompatible with privacysensitive settings; and (3) they require test-time optimization, which introduces computational overhead and limits their applicability in settings without model updates or labeled data in SER task.",

MELD  [21] , derived from multi-party dialogues in Friends, is evaluated using its official train/dev/test split, with emotions mapped to the unified 4-class scheme. RAVDESS  [22]  contains 2.5k studio-quality utterances averaging 5s, and we retain all original 8 emotion classes using a 5fold stratified cross-validation protocol. TESS  [23]  and SAVEE  [24] , both acted emotion datasets with consistent recording conditions, are evaluated using random 10-fold cross-validation with 4-class mapping. CREMA-D  [25] , containing 7k utterances averaging 4.5s, uses a 5-fold CV setup and retains its original 6 emotion classes, following  [1] .

CoOp  [3]  and CoCoOp  [4]  are few-shot prompt-learning methods requiring labeled target data. Treff-Adapter  [6]  and TPT  [5]  perform gradient-based test-time tuning, while MTA  [7]  and ZERO  [8]  are training-free, source-free baselines that do not explicitly model the test distribution. In contrast, Emo-TTA conducts sample-wise, optimization-free adaptation through a EM-based procedure that explicitly estimates the test-time distribution. Under CLAP-PANN- Update of Covariance. To assess the impact of covariance adaptation, we conduct an ablation study where the covariance matrix Σ is fixed as an identity matrix during evaluation (Tab. 3). This simplification reduces the scoring function to Euclidean distance, constraining the model's capacity to capture intra-class variability. As a result, the performance deteriorates under distribution shift. In contrast, updating Σ dynamically allows the model to more accurately represent the dispersion and correlation patterns of class features, leading to improved test-time recognition accuracy. ALM Priors. To evaluate the influence of audio-language priors and confidence-aware updates, we initialize class prototypes with CLAP-derived text embeddings and modulate their updates using prediction confidence measured via self-entropy (Tab. 3). Without prior-based initialization, the model suffers from poor alignment between prototypes and emotion classes, leading to performance degradation. In addition, disabling confidence weighting causes uncertain predictions to skew class statistics, reducing stability. Incorporating both components enables the model to adapt more robustly under distribution shifts by preserving semantic grounding and filtering noisy updates.",
