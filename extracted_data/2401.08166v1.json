      "text": "Existing emotional speech synthesis methods often utilize an utterance-level style embedding extracted from reference audio, neglecting the inherent multi-scale property of speech prosody. We introduce ED-TTS, a multi-scale emotional speech synthesis model that leverages Speech Emotion Diarization (SED) and Speech Emotion Recognition (SER) to model emotions at different levels. Specifically, our proposed approach integrates the utterance-level emotion embedding extracted by SER with fine-grained frame-level emotion embedding obtained from SED. These embeddings are used to condition the reverse process of the denoising diffusion probabilistic model (DDPM). Additionally, we employ crossdomain SED to accurately predict soft labels, addressing the challenge of a scarcity of fine-grained emotion-annotated datasets for supervising emotional TTS training.",

      "text": "Recent researches have shown significant progress in emotional text-to-speech (TTS) thanks to the denoising diffusion probabilistic models (DDPM)  [1, 2] . EmoDiff  [3]  uses DDPM with classifier guidance  [4]  to synthesize controllable and mixed emotion. However, such label guidance will lead to low diversity without manual control and is hard to extend to unseen emotions. EmoMix  [5]  uses a pre-trained speech emotion recognition (SER) model that extracts high dimensional emotion embedding from reference audio to condition the reverse process of DDPM. Such reference-based emotional TTS methods can generate more diverse emotion expression compared to label-based approaches. But the widely used utterance level style embedding fail to capture the multi-scale features of speech style, which span from coarse to fine. Some fine-grained prosodic expressions, like intonation, are studied. QI-TTS  [6]  uses a multi-style extractor where the final syllable level style indicates intonation, while the sentence level depicts emotion. But sentence level emotion representation can not accurately locating emotion boundaries and fine-grained variations of emotions in the synthesized speech. It's observed that occasionally, a speaker will stress certain segments of their speech, which makes the emotion more apparent. In that case, the rest of the sentence may sound very neutral. So, we should view emotions expressed in speech as varying speech events that have clear temporal boundaries, instead of the characteristics of the whole speech.\n\nSpeech emotion diarization (SED)  [7]  is a fine-grained speech emotion recognition task that aims to simultaneously identify the correct emotions and their corresponding boundaries following \"Which emotion appears when?\". To effectively capture the nuances of speech emotion and their boundary, we introduce ED-TTS. This multi-scale approach allows for the modeling of emotions at various levels. ED-TTS is a sequence-to-sequence architecture based on DDPM, with pretrained SER and SED models that can extract utterance-level and frame-level emotional features. Furthermore, we employ SED to address the challenge posed by the scarcity of finely annotated datasets for emotions in emotional TTS. We use the fine-grained soft emotion label predicted by SED on unlabeled TTS dataset to supervise TTS model training. Inspired by Cai et al.  [8] , we use cross-domain training to improve the soft label accuracy on TTS datasets by reducing the distribution shift of SED and TTS datasets. The main advantages of ED-TTS are:",

Above SDE has a corresponding reverse SDE that follows the diffusion process's reverse trajectory. By solving a discretized version of the reverse time SDE, an ordinary differential equation, GradTTS can generate data X 0 from terminal distribution X T as follows:\n\nwhere t ∈ 1 N , 2 N , . . . , 1 and N denotes the number of discretized reverse process steps. z t is sampled from standard Gaussian noise.

      "text": "As shown in the yellow part of Fig.  1 , we extend the emotion encoder of EmoMix  [5]  which contains single SER to multi-scale, to extract the emotion category, emotion variation and emotion boundary information. This module contains the pre-trained SER for utterance-level style features with an additional SED model for frame-level style features. We follow the SER  [10]  to extract a fixed size embedding from reference speech's mel-spectrogram and its delta, delta-delta coefficients. The SED  [7]  employs pre-trained WavLM  [11] , a modern self-supervised model, followed by a linear classifier. WavLM includes a CNN-based feature encoder followed by transformer blocks and is fine-tuned on the downstream frame-wise SED task. We use the transformer output as our frame-level style embedding. For speaker conditioning we use resemblyzer  [12]  as our speaker encoder.\n\nA challenge in fine-grained style conditioning is the alignment of variable-length frame-level prosodic features with input text representations  [13] . The traditional approach in emotional speech synthesis directly adds style embeddings to text embedding. To align the style representations with the phonetic representations Z c , we adopt the multi-head attention block which aims to reweight content according to the given style learning the alignment between the two modalities. The phoneme representations Z c processed by text encoder is used as query while frame-level style representation is key and value. After content-style alignment, the aligned representation is added with utterance-level style embedding and speaker embedding to form multi-scale style embedding Z s . Then Z s is fed to duration predictor and denoiser to condition the duration modeling and reverse DDPM process.",

      "text": "To minimize the emotion style gap and boundary offsets between reference and synthesized speech. We use SED to predict frame-level soft emotion labels of the unlabelled TTS dataset to supervise ED-TTS training. We train ED-TTS with an additional cross entropy loss which force the synthesized sample have the same frame-level emotion as reference speech. Since SED is pre-trained on a curated SED dataset which significantly differs from the TTS dataset, we employ domain adaptation techniques to minimize the distribution shift of different datasets.\n\nKernel-based metric, maximum mean miscrepancy [14] (MMD), is used to determine the equivalence of two distributions. It has been widely used in domain adaptation tasks and has been validated useful for cross-domain SER within the context of emotional TTS  [8] . Specifically, with the source data S = {S 1 , S 2 , . . . , S ns } and target data\n\nwhere ϕ(•) denote a map from data to reproducing kernel hilbert space (RKHS) and k means the Gaussian kernel function. We divided the source domain and the target domain into different subdomains according to emotion categories to adopt local MMD (LMMD)  [15]  for each subdomains. Moreover, we extend LMMD to multi-layer LMMD (MLMMD) which is adopted not only to bottleneck layer but also other CNN layers of the feature encoder part to achieve a more suitable shared feature space. In that case, MLMMD can be expressed as:\n\nwhere L denotes the count of CNN layers in the SED feature encoder. C is the number of emotion categories. The emotion categories in the source and target domain is mixed or unknown. So we use classification probabilities W C Si and W C Tj obtained from the pre-trained SER to represent unknown or mixed emotion categories  [5]  in the source domain and the target domain respectively. The training of cross-domain SED can be regard as fine-tuning a WavLM model on the down stream SED task and the total loss function for training is:\n\nwhere λ is the weight of MLMMD loss.",

In objective evaluation, Emotion Reclassification Accuracy (ERA) is used to measure how the synthesized speech fit the frame-level emotion labels of reference speech predicted by SED. Specifically,we reused our pre-trained SED to reclassify the synthesized audio clips and calculated the reclassification accuracy. Table  2  demonstrates that the vocoder's impact is minimal. ED-TTS outperforms the baseline models in terms of SMOS and ERA by a considerable margin while maintaining MOS scores. These findings highlight ED-TTS's advantage over the baseline models, attributed to its use of multi-scale emotion modeling and cross-domain training techniques.",
