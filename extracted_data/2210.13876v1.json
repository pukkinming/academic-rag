      "text": "One of the challenges in virtual environments is the difficulty users have in interacting with these increasingly complex systems. Ultimately, endowing machines with the ability to perceive users emotions will enable a more intuitive and reliable interaction. Consequently, using the electroencephalogram as a bio-signal sensor, the affective state of a user can be modelled and subsequently utilised in order to achieve a system that can recognise and react to the user's emotions. This paper investigates features extracted from electroencephalogram signals for the purpose of affective state modelling based on Russell's Circumplex Model. Investigations are presented that aim to provide the foundation for future work in modelling user affect to enhance interaction experience in virtual environments. The DEAP dataset was used within this work, along with a Support Vector Machine and Random Forest, which yielded reasonable classification accuracies for Valence and Arousal using feature vectors based on statistical measurements and band power from the a, {3, 8, and e waves and High Order Crossing of the EEG signal.",

      "text": "Due to their increasing complexity, one of the main challenges found in virtual environments (VEs) is user interaction. Therefore, it is important to structure interaction modalities based on the requirements of the application, which may include both traditional and natural user interfaces, situational awareness and adaptation, personalised content management, multimodal dialogue and multimedia applications.\n\nVEs typically require personalised interaction in order to maintain user engagement with the underlying task. While task engagement encompasses both the user's cognitive activity and motivation, it also requires an understanding of affective change in the user. Accordingly, physiological computing systems may be utilised to provide insight into the cognitive and affective processes associated with task engagement  [ 15] . In particular, an indication of the levels of brain activity, through acquisition and processing of electroencephalogram (EEG) signals, may yield benefits when incorporated as an additional input modality  [48] .\n\nIn recent studies, EEG has been used to map the responses to the environment directly to the user's brain activity [l ,  28, 33, 43, 49] . These systems are typically used for control purposes, enhancing traditional modalities such as mouse, keyboard, or game controller. However, this form of active interaction is still quite costly for users as it requires training and a good amount of both concentration and effort to modulate one's brain activity. This ultimately causes the user to focus more on the interaction modality itself than the underlying task. In order to achieve truly transparent interaction, the system is required to acquiesce to the user's intentions or needs. Using EEG as a bio-signal sensor to model the user's cognitive and affective state is one potential way to achieve an interaction that does not require any training or attention focus from the user.\n\nMany authors have investigated the use of EEG for recognizing user affect. However, EEG signals are complex, multi-modal time series and there is no consensus on which features are better suited for this task. The main contributions of this paper are twofold: (1) a summary of how affect recognition can augment VR environments targeting different applications, namely, medicine, education, entertainment and lifestyle;  (2)  an evaluation of several types of features for affect recognition using EEG on a benchmark dataset. For the purposes of the investigations, the DEAP dataset was used to provide an annotated set of EEG signals  [24] . Support Vector Machine (SVM) and Random Forest were employed to classify different affective states according to the Circumplex Model.",

VEs have also been shown to help children with Autism Spectrum Disorders (ASD) improve their social functioning  [3] .

      "text": "The entertainment industry is very enthusiastic regarding VEs, games being perhaps the most noticeable application. This enthusiasm is not surprising, to some degree, emotional experiences are what game designers create and sell  [35] . Not only can VEs be designed to elicit both positive and negative emotions  [13 , 42] , but also previous works have shown that emotion positively correlates with presencethe psychological sense of being in or existing in the VE in which one is immersed  [2] . Another well-known use of VE in games are virtual worlds, such as Second Life  [26] . The High Fidelity platform is able to track facial expressions in real time and transfer those to the user's avatar. Despite being able to mimic facial expressions related to speech and emotions, the system itself does not attempt to recognize affect  [34] . EEG could extend the high fidelity platform with the ability to adapt to users' affect. It would also enable users that are unable to change their facial expressions-due to paralysis for example-to take advantage of a platform like High Fidelity. The use of the automatic modulation of user's emotional states in VEs are limitless and benefit from the proven relation between presence and emotional state.",

      "text": "Currently, various input modalities exist that can be utilised to acquire information about users and their emotions. More commonly, audiovisual-based communication, such as eye gaze tracking, facial expressions, body movement detection, and speech and auditory analysis may be employed as input modalities. Furthermore, physiological measurements using sensor-based input signals, such as EEG, galvanic skin response, and electrocardiogram can also be utilised. However, the use of EEG as an input modality has a number of advantages that make it potentially suitable for use in real-life tasks including its non-invasive nature and relative tolerance to movement. EEG can be used as a standalone modality as well as combined to other biometric sensors. The company iMotions for example has successfully developed a commercial platform for monitoring physiological and psychological parameters of users while experiencing VR. This is a great example of how affect recognition can be used to add value to VR applications  [ 18, 20] .\n\nSeveral existing studies have exploited EEG as an input modality for the purpose of emotion recognition. Picard et al. looked at different techniques for feature extraction and selection in order to enhance emotion recognition by employing different biosignal data  [ 40] . They found that there is a variation in physiological signals of the same subject expressing the same emotion from day to day. Which impairs recognition accuracy if not managed properly. Konstantinidis et al. studied real-time classification of emotions by analysing EEG data recorded using 19 channels. They showed that extracting features from EEG data using a complex non-linear computation, which is a multi-channel correlation dimension, and processing the features using a parallel computing platform (i.e. CUDA) would substantially reduce the processing time needed. Their method facilitates real-time emotion recognition  [25 ] .  Petrantonakis et al.  proposes feature extraction methods based on Higher Order Crossing (HOC) analysis to recognise emotions from EEG data additionally to four different classification techniques. The highest reported classification accuracy was 83.33% using SVM trained on extracted HOC feature  [37] . Murugappan investigated feature extraction using wavelet transforms  [30] . Moreover, they used K-Nearest Neighbor to evaluate classification accuracy for emotions across two different sets of EEG channels (24 and 64 channels), with a resulting classification accuracy of 82.87%. Jenke et al. looked for feature selection methods extracted from EEG for emotion recognition  [21] . They presented a systematic comparison of the wide range of available feature extraction methods using machine learning techniques for feature selection. Multivariate feature selection techniques performed slightly better than univariate methods, generally requiring less than I 00 features on average.\n\nStill there are challenges encountered when attempting to exploit EEG for emotional state recognition. Extracting relevant and informative features from EEG signals from a large number of subjects and formulating a suitable representation of this data in order to distinguish different affective states is an extremely complicated process  [45] . This work utilizes a fairly large dataset of EEG signals to investigate the relevance of different features for the dimensions of Valence and Arousal, according to Russel's Circumplex Model of Affection. In this context, we aim to provide foundations for modelling user affect in order to enhance interaction experience in VEs.",

      "text": "The investigations and associated results presented in this paper show the potential of utilizing EEG signal data for recognising affective states. Based on the classification accuracy, the approach could be used to effectively recognise emotions in certain types of virtual reality environments. Educational applications could benefit from it by adapting the content of a course to the students anxiety levels, characterised by low levels of arousal and valence, detected by the bipartition approach. Other than that, the approach presented could be applied to medical applications that aim to help patients deal with phobias or entertainment platforms for social anxiety.\n\nBoth classification methods applied gave similar results, being the results for Random Forest slightly better than the ones for SVM. Particularly, the highest classification accuracy was obtained using the feature vector generated based on the statistical measurements derived from brainwaves, e.g 88.4% for Valence and 74% for Arousal.\n\nLikewise, using a feature vector based on the associated power bands and SVM also produced the classification accuracy of 88.4% for Valence and slightly lower for Arousal, 69.2%. In both cases, the Bipartition labelling scheme was used.  The highest classification accuracy rates were obtained using features extracted from the brainwaves, corroborating the neurophysilogical theories that relate those with several different mental states. The Statistic features and Spectral Power Density represent the activity level in each bandwave and can give us an insight about the relation between the affective dimensions of Valence and Arousal and the brain activation in each frequency. In Figs.  4  and 5 , we can see the Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curve for both Statistic features and SPD respectively.\n\nThe red dashed line represents the equivalent of a random guess. The higher the curves are from this diagonal, the more sensitive it is regarding the class, Valence or Arousal. Analysing those curves for Valence we can see in Fig.  4a  that a, AFD and ASD have the best results, as well as 8 and e in Fig.  5a , corroborating the results obtained from both classification methods. The results for Arousal show curves close to the diagonal, again corroborating our previous results, of low accuracy for all methods in general.\n\nFigures  6  and 7  show the distribution of features providing worst accuracy, in Fig.  6  and best accuracy, in Fig.  7 . We can see that the features of the methods with worst accuracy, such as the HOC features and the Statistical features in time domain, overlap for the classes of High and Low Valence and Arousal. On the contrary, there is less overlap on the features obtained from the methods with best accuracy, such as a and SPD of Brainwaves. Even though we obtained good results for some features, we can see in Figs.  6  and 7  that histograms of even the best features overlap considerably and result in ROC curves close to Random guess, as seen in Figs.  4  and 5 . This characteristics observed amongst the features investigated could be due to many reasons. The sensitivity of the self-assessment scale used to garner affect ratings is subjective, as it is based on the thoughts and impressions of the participant about the video he/she watched. Moreover, it is often the case that people do not know how to articulate their actual emotions and associated states due to ambiguity and mixed mental activities  [39] .\n\nTherefore, it is potentially the case that some of the participants could not precisely entail their actual emotional state using the SAM scale. Due to this factor, classification models were generated twice using two different mapping In the majority of the investigations, the classification accuracies obtained for Valence outperformed those obtained for Arousal. It is difficult to determine why this was the case but several factors may have contributed to this effect. One possible reason is that the concept of Arousal may be more difficult to understand and categorize than Valence, resulting in inconsistent labelling. In addition, participants within the DEAP dataset watched video clips as a stimuli, hence were passive during that time, resulting in a small range of Arousal values that were not distinctive ---= enough to be picked up by the classifier. This specific aspect could be improved if the data were obtained using a virtual environment, where the person has a greater sense of presence, hence having more influence in their emotional state, as discussed in chapter 2.",

      "text": "This paper investigated exploiting electroencephalogram data as an input modality for the purpose of providing VEs with the ability to recognize and detect the emotional states of users. Consequently, the results from several experiments using different sets of features, especially the ones descendant from brainwaves, extracted from EEG data within the DEAP dataset show the potential of utilizing EEG signal data. In addition, the observed discrepancy in classification accuracy due to different affective state mapping schemes was discussed, indicating that a degree of ambiguity will exist within such datasets, which has an obvious effect on the ability to accurately model affective states.\n\nMoreover, combining several features together does not necessarily increase classification accuracy, as discussed in chapter 4. For example, as shown in Table  4 , Combining o's and 0's statistical features for Arousal, gives the accuracy of 73.8%, worst than the result for 8 only.\n\nAdditionally, as the results depict, the features extracted from a, fJ, 8 and e waves and the classification accuracies obtained for Valence makes it potentially suitable as a metric for measuring this aspect of the affective state of a user, ranging from negative to positive (i.e. Low-Valence to High-Valence).\n\nThe preliminary results shown in this article will help informing and leading to further experiments that eventually integrate different input modalities together with EEG in order to potentially provide a more robust model of the user's affective state. The current set of investigations would benefit if repeated using another mapping scheme based on Fuzzy Logic, for example, in an effort to improve the classification of potentially ambiguous affective states.\n\nIt is also interesting to extend the investigation regarding brain activation and the affective dimensions of Valence and Arousal. Not only how the negative (Low-Valence) and positive (High-Valence) states relate in terms of absolute values with the brain activation, but also how this activation is propagated though the entire extension of the brain.\n\nNonetheless, it is important to expand the study and the methods to real-time applications, and determine how those might behave in the real scenario of VEs. Not only taking into account the computational cost, aiming for real-time and embedded systems; but also how the virtual environment should adapt to this new form of awareness and how the user will react to this new form of enhanced interaction.\n\nThe article also discusses the importance of taking into account the effective qualities of the virtual environment to improve user experience and the many potential applications of such awareness for a different range of areas, such as medicine, education, entertainment and life style. The affective qualities of a virtual environment contribute to the engagement or feeling of presence of the user and vice-versa. When the affective qualities of the VE do not match the expectations of the user or the affective level of the situation being lived at the environment, it may have a negative effect on the user experience. Recognizing the importance of the affective qualities and awareness of a VE and introducing these often neglected aspects into the development process will improve the user experience.",
