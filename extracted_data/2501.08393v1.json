      "text": "Conversational agents (CAs) are revolutionizing human-computer interaction by evolving from text-based chatbots to empathetic digital humans (DHs) capable of rich emotional expressions. This paper explores the integration of neural and physiological signals into the perception module of CAs to enhance empathetic interactions. By leveraging these cues, the study aims to detect emotions in real-time and generate empathetic responses and expressions. We conducted a user study where participants engaged in conversations with a DH about emotional topics. The DH responded and displayed expressions by mirroring detected emotions in realtime using neural and physiological cues. The results indicate that participants experienced stronger emotions and greater engagement during interactions with the Empathetic DH, demonstrating the effectiveness of incorporating neural and physiological signals for real-time emotion recognition. However, several challenges were identified, including recognition accuracy, emotional transition speeds, individual personality effects, and limitations in voice tone modulation. Addressing these challenges is crucial for further refining Empathetic DHs and fostering meaningful connections between humans and artificial entities. Overall, this research advances human-agent interaction and highlights the potential of real-time neural and physiological emotion recognition in creating empathetic DHs.",

      "text": "Due to their accessibility and ease of use, current methods of emotion recognition predominantly employ behavioral signals such as facial expressions  [Li and Deng 2018; Samadiani et al. 2019; Y. Sun et al. 2020 ], text and audio analysis  [Sailunaz et al. 2018 ]. These modalities are commonly used in many human-computer interaction (HCI) applications  [Samadiani et al. 2019] . Some applications, like gaming  [AlZoubi et al. 2023] , self-driving cars  [Siam et al. 2023] , online embedded systems  [Jeong and Ko 2018] , and social robots and conversational agents  [Antony et al. 2020; Luo et al. 2022; Ruiz-Garcia et al. 2018] , use real-time facial expression recognition and speech analysis to understand the user's state. Although these approaches display potential in identifying basic emotions, they encounter obstacles such as cultural disparities, diversity in age and gender, and the susceptibility of behavioral modalities to manipulation by the user, thereby allowing for easy deception.  [Hossain and Gedeon 2019] .\n\nResearchers have increasingly incorporated physiological measures like Electroencephalography (EEG)  [Alarcao and Fonseca 2017] , Galvanic Skin Response (GSR), heart rate variability (HRV)  [Udovičić et al. 2017 ], blood volume pressure (BVP), body temperature (BT), respiration rate (RR), etc  [Chunawale, Bedekar, et al. 2020]  to address these limitations for emotion recognition. Many researchers have shown that although EEG and physiological signals are weak, they can be used to reliably recognize underlying emotions  [Blaiech et al. 2013; Shu et al. 2018] . Combining these various modalities can further improve the accuracy of emotion recognition  [Huang et al. 2019; Zhu et al. 2020] . Despite advancements in neural and physiological emotion recognition, these modalities have rarely been used in real-time emotion recognition. Their potential and limitations need to be explored more deeply for real-life scenarios such as interaction with conversational agents.",

      "text": "The evolution of conversational agents towards achieving empathetic interactions has seen significant advancements in the past few years. Empathetic conversational agents or affective conversational agents are designed to understand and respond to users in a way that reflects an understanding of the user's emotions, providing a more human-like interaction experience  [Smith et al. 2011; Yang et al. 2019] .  Samrose et al. [Samrose et al. 2020]  explored the potential of empathetic conversational agents in mitigating boredom, highlighting the importance of emotional intelligence in conversational agents to adjust user mood and enhance task performance. Sakhrani et al.  [Sakhrani et al. 2021 ] have focused on creating empathetic agents for mental health support, emphasizing the need for agents that can conduct empathetic and free-flowing conversations to assist individuals who may be hesitant to seek help from human therapists.\n\nMost conversational agents rely only on text emotion recognition, which is a widely studied area  [Antony et al. 2020; Luo et al. 2022; Provoost et al. 2017] . For example, Zaranis et al.  [Zaranis et al. 2021]  developed EmpBot, an empathetic chatbot that utilizes sentiment understanding and empathy forcing to enhance the empathetic responses of conversational agents. Ayshabi and Idicula [Ayshabi and Idicula 2021] introduced a model that employs a multi-resolution mechanism with multiple decoders to capture the nuances of user emotions and generate empathetic responses. This approach aims to improve the perception and expression of emotional states in dialogue systems. However, facial expressions and speech tone have more information about the user's emotion  [Luo et al. 2022] . For example, Hussain et al.  [Hussain et al. 2012 ] presented a novel architecture for affective interaction with conversational agents. They fused audio, video, and text to detect affective states. Takana et al.  [Tanaka et al. 2017 ] introduced a social skill training agent for people with Autism that uses audio-visual features for detecting emotional states. Similarly, Aneja et al.  [Aneja et al. 2021 ] introduced a conversational agent that can recognize human behavior during open-ended conversations and automatically align its responses to the conversational and expressive style of the other party by using multimodal inputs, including facial expressions and speech. Tavabi et al.  [Tavabi 2019 ] developed a multimodal deep neural network that integrates emotional tone in language and facial expressions to recognize opportunities for empathetic responses in humanagent interactions. This study highlights the potential of incorporating visual and auditory cues to enhance the emotional intelligence of Empathetic CAs.\n\nDespite these advancements, a significant gap remains in integrating the neural and physiological data spectrum for emotion recognition. While multimodal approaches have begun to incorporate visual and auditory cues, the potential of neural and physiological signals (e.g., EEG, HRV, and EDA) in enhancing the empathetic capabilities of conversational agents remains largely untapped. These data sources could offer deeper insights into the user's emotional state and reveal genuine emotions reliably  [Hossain and Gedeon 2019; Shu et al. 2018 ]. This enhanced understanding would empower CAs to generate more nuanced and authentically empathetic responses. However, conversational agents rarely use neural and physiological modalities to recognize emotion in real-time. One exception was the work of  Val-Calvo et al. [Val-Calvo et al. 2020] , who used an affective robot for storytelling and created a realistic paradigm for evoking emotions. They recorded EEG, BVP, GSR, and video data and estimated emotional state in real-time subject-dependently. However, the robot did not use the recognition result to adapt its behavior. Similarly, Ghandeharioun et al.  [Ghandeharioun et al. 2019]  introduced EMMA, which is an emotion-aware chatbot that detects emotions in real-time based on the user's smartphone location and provides wellness suggestions for mental health according to detected emotions using location data. However, they did not consider any other source of data, especially physiological cues. Equipping conversational agents with physiological emotion recognition is crucial, especially in scenarios where recording audio and video is challenging due to environmental factors like noise, poor camera angles, or low light conditions. Moreover, audio and video alone often fail to fully capture emotional states. For example, when supporting older adults, individuals with autism, or those who face difficulties expressing emotions verbally or behaviorally, leveraging neural and physiological cues can provide a more accurate and effective understanding of their emotional needs.",

We disabled all of the Soul Machine features of speech and facial expression recognition so that we could implement our own. We created two different designs of DH in this research. One is a neutral DH with a simple perceptual module. It did not have an emotion recognition module and responds with a neutral pre-programmed answer and takes appropriate action based on the user's input and dialog flow. The other is an empathetic DH whose perceptual module is based on neural and physiological signals. It recognizes emotions in real-time and creates the appropriate expression by mirroring detected emotion. It chooses the appropriate response from a dataset of responses that reflect and appreciate the user's detected emotions. We used a female DH whose appearance and voice were identical in both DHs.",

Participants began by providing informed consent and receiving instructions. They were then seated in front of a monitor and laptop and fitted with an OpenBCI cap and Shimmer sensor in their non-dominant hand. Participants were alone during the data collection period in a quiet, controlled laboratory setting. The experimental setup and the devices used for data collection are shown in Figure  2 . The acquired EEG, PPG, and EDA signals were primarily used for real-time emotion recognition.

      "text": "We developed an orchestration server, which acts as the Soul Machine orchestration layer, to perform several functions within the empathetic DH. The server's main tasks included understanding the user's intent, selecting the most suitable pre-written response from a database of responses, provided in the supplementary materials, and generating appropriate facial expressions. It controls the dialog flow and creates responses based on the detected emotions through a real-time emotion recognition system. The orchestration server is also responsible for regulating the expressions of the digital human based on the user's real-time emotional state. Figure  3  shows the overall architecture of the empathetic DH that works based on physiological responses.\n\nWe customized the appearance of the DH and disabled all emotion recognition features available through the Soul Machines web browser. Instead, we employed our own multimodal emotion  recognition system and integrated it with the DH using an orchestration server. In the empathetic condition, the real-time emotion recognition system detected emotions every 5 seconds using a 20-second sliding window with overlap. The DH updated its facial expressions every 5 seconds based on these detections. Additionally, during interactions, the DH responded according to the most frequently detected emotion during the user's speech.\n\nIn this study, we used the dataset from prior research  [Saffaryazdi, Kirkcaldy, et al. 2024 ] to train emotion recognition models. This dataset includes EEG, PPG, and EDA data collected from 16 participants during dyadic conversations conducted in both remote and face-to-face settings, with each condition consisting of 8 trials. Due to technical issues, particularly with EEG signal recording in this dataset, some data was missing. Consequently, we had 240 trials to train the EDA and PPG models and 204 trials to train the EEG model. Since this datsets labels are based on dimensional arousal-valence model and earlier research explored that dimensional emotion models are more sufficient, reliable, and more accurate for self-assessments in explaining emotions [Eerola2011comparison;  Lichtenstein et al. 2008] , and dataset labels are based on arousal-valence model, we used a 2D-dimensional emotion model, and the results of predictions are based on arousal and valence. We mapped 5 levels of arousal and valence levels to low(-1) and high(1) values based on 1.\n\nWe followed the same methodology as described in  [Saffaryazdi, Kirkcaldy, et al. 2024 ] to preprocess data, extract features, and train emotion recognition models using each signal. This approach has proven effective in recognizing emotions during conversations. We extracted features listed in Table  4  and used the Random Forest Classifier (RFC), previously employed in emotion classification research  [Chaparro et al. 2018; Menezes et al. 2017] , to train the models for real-time emotion recognition.\n\n𝑉 𝑎𝑙𝑒𝑛𝑐𝑒𝑅𝑎𝑡𝑒 = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5} Eevery 5 seconds, we obtained the last 20 seconds of data from each signal, preprocessed them, extracted features from them, and fed them into the trained models to recognize emotions based on arousal and valence levels. We considered 20 seconds because the heartpy library that we used for extracting features from the PPG signal needed at least 20 seconds of data to extract HRV features. We used the weighted decision fusion method shown in Equation 3 to combine the recognition results from neural and physiological modalities and detect the emotional state. Equal weights were considered for detecting valence levels for all modalities' predictions. However, we considered a higher weight for EDA and PPG, which was 2 compared to EEG was 1 for arousal detection because PPG and EDA signals have been shown to have greater reliability in detecting arousal levels  [KOŁODZIEJ et al. 2019; Tarnowski et al. 2018; Udovičić et al. 2017 ]. The Equation  4 shows how we mapped the result of fusion to -1 and 1 values. The empathetic DH expressed emotions based on the result of the fusion method, primarily by mirroring the emotional state as listed in Table  1 .",

There are not many differences between various positive expressions (with various intensity or arousal levels) in the avatar's expressions. So we considered all as happiness which means mirroring positive emotions with happiness expression. For expressions during answering, Soul machines provide happiness strong and slight, which exactly matches the arousal level. For negative emotions, including anger or fear, the soul machine expressions were quite similar, which made the mapping easier.

In the empathetic condition, the DH reflected the recognized emotion in its expressions and responses. The empathetic DH expressed its feelings about the image, asked questions, and responded in an empathetic way according to the participant's response.\n\nWe followed the approach described in  [Saffaryazdi, Kirkcaldy, et al. 2024 ] to generate emotional conversations but replaced the human interviewer with the DH. We selected eight images from the IAPS image set  [Lang and Bradley 2007]  as the topic of conversation, two from each of the following categories: High Arousal-High Valence (HAHV), High Arousal-Low Valence (HALV), Low Arousal-High Valence (LAHV), and Low Arousal-Low Valence (LALV). We sorted the dataset according to arousal and valence level, ignored images with high negative subjects like suicide or violence, and chose images with the highest and lowest arousal and valence levels with popular subjects to discuss.

One possible reason for this lack of significance could be the presence of considerable noise in the EEG signals caused by talking during the conversation. The high levels of noise might have made it challenging for the statistical model to identify any discernible patterns in the data. Furthermore, during a conversation, multiple activities such as decision-making, language processing, motor cortex activity, emotion processing, and memory and information processing occur. These activities are likely to be common during interactions with both types of virtual agents. As a result, any subtle differences in brain activity related to the agent type may have been overshadowed by the shared neural processes.\n\nFuture research could focus on developing more robust noise reduction methods for EEG signals to better explore the effect of agent type on brain activities. In addition, using more detailed features in the analysis could help uncover subtle variations in brain activity that might be associated with different types of virtual agents. By addressing these challenges, we can gain deeper insights into the neural mechanisms underlying human-agent interactions and their potential implications for improving virtual agent design and usability.",

A higher EDA peak amplitude indicates a greater increase in skin conductance, which is associated with higher emotional arousal  [Benedek and Kaernbach 2010] . Additionally, the higher positive derivatives of EDA peaks observed in interactions with the empathetic agent suggest that the skin conductance is increasing at a faster rate during these interactions, further indicating higher emotional arousal. While EDA signals may not directly reflect the valence state  [Melander et al. 2018] , they can serve as an indicator of emotional arousal, excitement, and engagement [Kreibig 2010]. In the current study, interactions with the empathetic agent resulted in an increase in skin conductance responses. This could be attributed to a more joyful and engaging experience during interactions with the empathetic agent, leading to heightened emotional arousal.\n\nHowever, it is important to note that some participants provided post-study verbal feedback indicating feelings of nervousness while interacting with the empathetic agent. They found the concept of empathy emanating from a machine to be peculiar and unappealing. for example, some of them mentioned, \"The empathic condition was weird and I could not be able to connect with it. I usually expect a neutral reaction from a stranger or a machine.\", or \"Empathetic Condition was realistic but weird.\". These feelings might have contributed to the observed increase in skin conductance responses during these interactions.",

      "text": "Throughout the interactions with the DH, three factors were collected to evaluate the emotions expressed by the DH in response to the human participants. These factors focused on assessing the appropriateness of reflected emotions, the expression of emotions, and the timing of these expressions. To understand the impact of the agent type on these factors, a set of one-way repeated measure ANOVA with ART was performed. The result of statistical analysis demonstrated that the agent type significantly affected the appropriateness (F(1, 166) = 10, p <0.002) and timing (F(1, 166) = 6, p <0.01) of the reflected expressions.\n\nIn Figure  9 , the point plot illustrates the effect of agent type on the appropriateness of real-time emotions, expressions, and their timing. It is evident from the figure that the empathetic agent tended to use reflected expressions that were more appropriate and at the correct timing. Moreover, the reflected emotion quality was better in the empathetic DH, although this improvement did not reach statistical significance. To explore the appropriateness of empathetic DH expressions in different emotional states, a series of two-way repeated measure ANOVA with ART was conducted on participants' ratings in the empathetic condition, with arousal and valence as the conditions. To consider the individual's actual emotional state during the conversation, we mapped the reported arousal and valence using Equations 1 and 2, respectively. These values served as the emotional state conditions in the statistical analysis.\n\nThe results revealed significant differences in the empathetic DH's effectiveness in displaying appropriate emotions, expressions, and timing across different valence levels. The empathetic DH's effectiveness in displaying appropriate emotions and expressions across arousal levels was also significant. However, there were no significant interactions between arousal and valence levels concerning emotion, expression, and timing appropriateness (Table  7 ).\n\nThe point plots presented in Figure  10  show that the DH was more successful in expressing positive and high-arousal emotions. One possible explanation could be the model's proficiency in detecting high arousal and valence emotions. Another potential factor might be that the agent struggled to effectively express negative emotions effectively.",

The results indicated that the emotional state of the conversation was significantly affected by the target emotion of the conversation (p-value <0.05).

      "text": "In this paper, we created a real-time emotion recognition application that recognizes emotions using multimodal data. We combined neural and physiological signals to recognize emotion every 5 seconds in real-time and integrated it with a DH from Soul Machines company. The real-time emotions fed into the DH, and DH created its expressions and responses according to the detected emotions empathetically by mirroring the participant's emotional state according to table 1. Using the multimodal real-time emotion recognition system and the integrated DH, we designed a user study and compared human physiological responses and self-reports in an empathetic and neutral mode.\n\nThe results show that people had emotional conversations with neutral and empathetic agents. They felt stronger emotions during their interactions with the empathetic agents. However, based on self-report data, in negative conversations, the empathetic agent was not as successful in understanding or sharing the emotions. This is likely because the agent could not effectively identify and reflect negative emotions.\n\nThe empathetic agent's expressions and responses were more appropriate in positive conversations and at the appropriate time. However, it could not show appropriate expressions at the right time in the negative conversations. The inability to show appropriate expressions at the right time in negative conversations made it difficult for the agent to build rapport and trust with participants. If an agent is not able to effectively respond to negative emotions, it may come across as insensitive or uncaring. Or maybe it is not appropriate to mirror negative emotions like sadness, fear, and anger. It might be more appropriate to have neutral or concerned expressions in these circumstances. This could be explored in future research.\n\nOur analysis of physiological signals also revealed a significantly higher level of HRV and skin conductance responses in interaction with the empathetic agent. These findings show that people experienced more emotional arousal and engagement in interaction with empathetic agent. They also had better emotion regulation in interaction with the empathetic agent than the neutral agent.\n\nOverall, people enjoyed and engaged more and felt more empathy in interaction with the empathetic DH. This shows that responding based on neural and physiological signals effectively creates empathetic agents and increases the empathy between humans and agents. However, the findings of this study suggest that there is still room for improvement in the development of empathetic agents by improving emotion recognition accuracy.\n\nIn this study, we faced some challenges and limitations, as discussed below. We could create more empathetic agents by addressing these shortcomings in the future.\n\n• Recognition Accuracy: The level of empathy between humans and the digital human agent was directly influenced by the accuracy of the emotion recognition method. However, achieving a robust model capable of accurately and swiftly detecting emotions using EEG and physiological signals requires further exploration and research. In the future, we can enhance recognition accuracy by using deep learning methods and adopting a more robust fusion strategy. It is essential to also consider the recognition speed while seeking to improve accuracy.\n\nIncorporating behavioral modalities such as facial expressions and speech recognition could also offer the benefits of both behavioral and physiological modalities. By integrating these modalities, we can potentially enhance the overall performance and effectiveness of the empathetic conversational agent. • Avatar gender: Due to the constraints in participant recruitment, such as the difficulty of the EEG setup, we considered only a female avatar to interact with participants. However, some individuals find it easier to interact with female interviewers, while others are more at ease with male interviewers  [Brophy 1985; Tam et al. 2020] . To mitigate the effect of the avatar's gender in future studies, increasing the sample size and considering a male avatar would be beneficial. • Emotional Transition: Different modalities reflect the emotional transition in different time scales. For instance, the EEG signal can swiftly predict emotional transitions, while the PPG signal takes some time to accurately reflect the real emotion, resulting in differing recognition outcomes across modalities. Although this study did not extensively explore emotional transitions, such transitions commonly occur in everyday conversations. Further research is required to investigate the impact of emotion transitions on different modalities and their recognition accuracy to better understand and leverage their potential in empathetic conversational agents. • Personality Effect: Individuals with varying personalities may experience differing levels of empathy with the same agent in similar situations. Some individuals might feel uneasy or awkward interacting with a machine and expressing themselves, while others may feel more at ease and relaxed interacting with the agent compared to a human. To further enhance the reliability of the findings, future studies could recruit a larger and more diverse participant pool, thereby reducing the potential influence of personality variations on the results.\n\n• Voice Tone The version of the Soul Machines' DH used in this study lacked the capability to control the voice tone to reflect its emotional state. Incorporating an agent that can modulate its voice tone based on the user's emotional state would be beneficial to create a more empathetic interaction in the future. • Language model The version of Soul Machines' Digital Human (DH) utilized in this study did not support the use of Large Language Models (LLMs). As a result, the agent's responses were drawn from a predefined database tailored to the detected emotional conditions. In the future, integrating LLMs could significantly enhance the quality of interactions by enabling more dynamic, context-aware, and engaging conversations, thereby improving overall user experience and engagement.",

      "section_name": "Conclusions",
      "text": "This research aimed to develop and implement a real-time emotion recognition application integrated with a digital human (DH) agent to facilitate empathetic interactions between humans and agents. The novelty lies in the integration of neural and physiological signals into the perception module of conversational agents, enhancing empathetic interactions through real-time physiological and neural emotion recognition. This is one of the first examples of using physiological cues to enable a DH to identify and respond to a user's emotional state empathetically by just relying on neural and physiological cues.\n\nThe findings indicate that participants experienced stronger emotions and engagement during interactions with empathetic agents, as evidenced by physiological responses and self-reports. However, challenges and limitations were also encountered, highlighting areas for improvement in future research.\n\nKey areas for enhancement include using large language models (LLMs) for making the conversations and improving the accuracy of emotion recognition methods. LLMs, such as GPT-based models, can generate more natural, context-aware, and engaging dialogue. By incorporating these models, we can simulate human-like conversations that adapt dynamically to user input, making interactions feel more authentic and engaging.\n\nAdvanced deep learning techniques can be used to improve the accuracy of emotion detection. In addition, integrating behavioral modalities such as facial expression analysis and speech recognition enriches the understanding of user emotions. For example, combining data from facial expressions, vocal tone, and textual content can provide a more comprehensive emotional profile. This holistic approach ensures the system can detect and respond to emotions even when one modality is less informative or unavailable. However, we should consider the limitations of each modality in all situations.\n\nIncorporating voice tone modulation capabilities into digital human agents could considerably enhance the empathetic interaction experience, addressing a current limitation observed in the study.\n\nOverall, while the findings demonstrate the potential of real-time emotion recognition and empathetic digital agents, ongoing research is essential to address the identified challenges and further refine the development of empathetic conversational agents. By addressing these limitations, future studies can contribute to the advancement of human-agent interaction and foster more empathetic and meaningful connections between humans and artificial entities.",
