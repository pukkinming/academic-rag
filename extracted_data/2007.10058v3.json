      "text": "In recent years, great strides have been made in the field of affective computing. Several models have been developed to represent and quantify emotions. Two popular ones include (i) categorical models which represent emotions as discrete labels, and (ii) dimensional models which represent emotions in a Valence-Arousal (VA) circumplex domain. However, there is no standard for annotation mapping between the two labelling methods. We build a novel algorithm for mapping categorical and dimensional model labels using annotation transfer across affective facial image datasets. Further, we utilize the transferred annotations to learn rich and interpretable data representations using a variational autoencoder (VAE). We present \"LeVAsa\", a VAE model that learns implicit structure by aligning the latent space with the VA space. We evaluate the efficacy of LeVAsa by comparing performance with the Vanilla VAE using quantitative and qualitative analysis on two benchmark affective image datasets. Our results reveal that LeVAsa achieves high latent-circumplex alignment which leads to improved downstream categorical emotion prediction. The work also demonstrates the trade-off between degree of alignment and quality of reconstructions.",

      "text": "Emotions are intrinsic characteristics of mammals, particularly overt in human behaviour  [5, 17, 29] . Intelligent systems must employ means to incorporate emotions for a more natural interaction  [31] . This surge for \"emotional intelligence\" has evolved into the field of affective computing, which by definition encompasses the creation of and interaction with machines that can sense, recognize, respond to, and influence emotions  [32] . Several models of emotion have been developed over the years, which are considered as the backbone of affective computing  [11, 12, 25, 40] . Among these models, a popular choice is the Categorical Model which describes six basic discrete emotions, namely, happiness, anger, disgust, sadness, fear, and surprise  [8] . However, this model failed to capture relations between the discrete emotions. Moreover, there is a lack of consistency in the choice of these fundamental emotions  [7] . As a result, Russell & Mehrabian  [35]  developed the Dimensional Model which suggests that each emotional state can be defined in terms of Valence (pleasure of an emotion), Arousal (energy of an emotion) and Dominance (controlling nature of an emotion). The Dominance dimension is commonly ignored since the valencearousal (VA) dimensional model was shown to possess adequate reliability, convergent validity, and discriminant validity  [36] . This led to the conceptualization of the Circumplex Model to represent affective states as a circle in a 2D bipolar VA space  [34] . The VA variables are typically considered independent  [10] . Motivation: The existence of different models of emotions result in a range of possible annotation strategies for affective data  [9, 21, 24, 27, 28] . This poses two challenges: (i) building deep models on affective data, and (ii) drawing collective insights from multiple datasets having potentially different formats of annotations  [6] .\n\nIn this paper, we present a novel algorithm for mapping annotations of the Categorical Model to those of the Dimensional Model through annotation transfer across affective facial image datasets. The subsequent step following annotation mapping is to obtain meaningful representations. With the increased use of deep neural networks and generative models, there have been significant advances in emotion modelling and affective computing  [13, 19, 33] . Variational Autoencoders (VAEs)  [20]  are known to yield disentangled latent representations and generate new data samples  [15, 16, 39] . They have been used extensively in affective computing to represent text, audio, image and electroencephalography (EEG) data  [22, 41] . Applying VAEs on affective facial images to obtain disentangled image representations can (i) provide high quality feature representations for downstream tasks  [2, 30] , and (ii) serve applications like facial editing and data augmentation  [23] . In our study, we obtain interpretable features by aligning the latent space of a VAE with the VA space. We show that this improves performance in downstream tasks of affect classification and regression, as demonstrated on two benchmark affective image datasets. Our major contributions are (i) an annotation transfer algorithm for label transfer between Categorical and Dimensional models of emotion and (ii) a regularised VAE model \"LeVAsa\" (Latent Encodings for Valence-Arousal Structure Alignment) that yields an interpretable latent space with an implicit structure aligned with the VA space.",

We employ variational autoencoder based models because of their simple training protocols and structured inductive priors. We compare two VAE models, Vanilla VAE and LeVAsa. This comparison is justified because: (1) No baseline VA structured latent    2 ) the Vanilla VAE features being unbiased (owing to no explicit supervision) may perform better on the downstream tasks. The latent space for both models was constructed to comprise of three chunks. Figure  1  depicts our model architectures.\n\nFor the Vanilla VAE, no explicit alignment was imposed on the latent space, whereas for LeVAsa, we take inspiration from recent work  [4, 18]  and model the latent space as follows:\n\n• 𝑍 𝑣 -subspace consisting of valence attributes 𝑧 𝑣 that learn to encode the valence features of image samples • 𝑍 𝑎 -subspace consisting of arousal attributes 𝑧 𝑎 that learn to encode the arousal features of image samples • 𝑍 𝑧 -subspace consisting of other miscellaneous generative attributes 𝑧 𝑧 that are required for high-fidelity reconstruction of the input data distribution.\n\nGiven a dataset of 𝑁 affective images 𝑋 = {𝑥 1 , 𝑥 2 , ..., 𝑥 𝑁 }, our VAE backbone consists of encoder 𝑓 𝜃 and decoder 𝑔 𝜙 given by:\n\nWe train the Vanilla VAE with a simple reconstruction loss along with a modified Kullback-Leibler (KL) loss (Eq. 1). We induce a N (0, 𝑰 ) prior on all three attributes 𝑧 𝑣 , 𝑧 𝑎 and 𝑧 𝑧 .\n\nWe employ the same backbone Vanilla VAE architecture for the LeVAsa model with two major modifications:\n\n(1) Projection Heads: We use two non-linear projection heads ℎ 𝑣 and ℎ 𝑎 which map the encoded valence and arousal representations 𝑧 𝑣 and 𝑧 𝑎 to the valence and arousal label space (giving label representations 𝑟 𝑣 and 𝑟 𝑎 ). The projections obtained are represented as follows:\n\n(2) VA-regularization loss: To impose an explicit alignment of the 𝑧 𝑣 and 𝑧 𝑎 attributes with the VA ground truth factors, we introduce a VA-regularization loss as follows:\n\nwhere L takes the form of MSE for continuous and BCE for discrete annotation types. MSE/BCE are design choices and can be replaced by suitable likelihood-based loss functions. The overall optimization objective for the LeVAsa model is:\n\nwhere 𝜆 𝐾𝐿 and 𝜆 𝐶 are hyperparameters.",

      "text": "We measure the alignment of LeVAsa's 𝑍 𝑣 ∪ 𝑍 𝑎 latent space with the VA ground truths using normalized Euclidean and Manhattan distance metrics for continuous annotations, and Cross Entropy measure for discrete annotations. This helps quantify the degree of latent-circumplex alignment. For the Vanilla VAE, we determine the 𝑧 𝑣 and 𝑧 𝑎 chunks heuristically by considering the two latent chucks which aligned best with the corresponding valence and arousal ground truths. Further, we reduce the dimensionality of the 𝑧 𝑣 and 𝑧 𝑎 latent chunks and plot them alongside the ground truth to replicate the circumplex representation.\n\nIt is found that LeVAsa outperformed Vanilla VAE for both continuous and discrete annotations (Table  1 ). This clearly exhibits the superior latent-circumplex alignment achieved by LeVAsa. For discrete annotations, in case of AFEW-VA, the difference between the cross entropy measures of the Vanilla VAE and LeVAsa is greater than in case of IMFDB. This could be attributed to the different image types in both datasets. The circumplex plots (Figure  3 ) for LeVAsa reveal reduced variance and increased alignment with true labels. This validates the quantitative results in Table  1 .  To gain further insights, we assess the regressive power of 𝑧 𝑣 and 𝑧 𝑎 by their ability to predict the corresponding VA ground truths. We use Multi Layer Perceptron (MLP) Regression. This analysis applies to continuous annotations hence was conducted only on the models trained on IMFDB dataset with continuous VA values.     2 ). Furthermore, the goodness of fit metrics (explained variance and 𝑅 2 ) showed better performance in the case of LeVAsa. These results further strengthen our hypothesis.",

Due to lack of discrete emotion labels in the AFEW-VA dataset, it was excluded from this analysis. We randomized the data splits across Continuous and Discrete experiments to ensure an unbiased setup. Model performance is evaluated using classification accuracy. We utilize a simple one-layered MLP to ensure that the accuracy is a direct measure of representation quality and not influenced by the complexity of the classifier.\n\nIt is seen that LeVAsa has significantly better predictive power as compared to the Vanilla VAE. Moreover, for LeVAsa, the VA chunks alone are more informative in emotion prediction as compared to 𝑧 𝑣 ⊕ 𝑧 𝑎 ⊕ 𝑧 𝑧 chunks altogether. Also, the improvement in classification accuracy by employing LeVAsa in place of Vanilla VAE can be compared under the continuous and discrete settings. This reveals that LeVAsa representations from the model trained with discrete annotations and BCE loss (Eq. 2) proves to be better at classifying emotion labels. This is due to the discrete nature of emotion labels which correlate well with the model representations.",

Thus, along with analyses of the latent representations, we study the quality of reconstructions (Figure  4 ).\n\nIt is observed that the quality of the reconstructed faces is slightly compromised in the case of LeVAsa as compared to Vanilla VAE. This can be attributed to the slightly higher variance of the learnt LeVAsa decoding distribution  [1, 15] . By Shannon's rate-distortion theory  [3] , there is a trade-off between the distortion (reconstruction quality) and rate (representation quality). Since we are imposing an explicit compression bottleneck on the latent space, it is expected that the reconstruction quality is slightly compromised in order to achieve better interpretability of latent representations.",

The results showed that the LeVAsa model obtains robust and interpretable representations enabling improved downstream affective task performance. In the future, we hope to extend the annotation-transfer algorithm to action-unit annotations, and test the expressiveness of the representations by performing latent traversals for data augmentation and facial editing.",
