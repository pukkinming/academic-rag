This study aims to extend the ResEmoteNet model by employing a knowledge distillation framework to develop Mini-ResEmoteNet models-lightweight student models-tailored for usability testing. Experiments were conducted on the FER2013 and RAF-DB datasets to assess the efficacy of three student model architectures: Student Model A, Student Model B, and Student Model C, their development involves reducing the number of feature channels in each layer of the teacher model by approximately 50%, 75%, and 87.5% respectively. Besides demonstrating exceptional performance on the FER2013 dataset, Student Model A (E1) achieved a test accuracy of 76.33%, marking a 0.21% absolute improvement over EmoNeXt, Moreover, the results exhibit absolute improvements in terms of inference speed and memory usage during inference compared to the ResEmoteNet model, the findings indicate that the proposed methods surpass other stateof-the-art approaches.",

      "text": "Facial expression recognition (FER) has become a crucial field of study in computer vision with important applications in human-computer interaction, emotion analysis, and usability testing. Subtle variations in facial components such as lips, teeth, skin, hair, cheekbones, nose, face shape, eyebrows, eyes, jawline, and mouth complicate the FER task. FER systems operate through three main stages: face acquisition, feature extraction, and emotion classification. These stages enable the detection and interpretation of human facial expressions across seven predefined emotional categories. In the face acquisition stage, methods like Faster R-CNN and YOLO  [1]  are employed for efficient face detection achieving high accuracy by localizing facial regions in images. In feature extraction, CNN-based models like ResNet capture hierarchical patterns from facial data, while SE networks  [2]  recalibrate channel importance to focus on emotionally relevant information. Vision transformers  [3]  offer the ability to capture long-range dependencies across facial features. In the emotion classification stage, extracted features are assigned to one of the seven emotion classes. This process is typically performed by specialized deep learning models, with multimodal approaches integrating visual and contextual data for improved accuracy  [4] .",

FMAE  [7]  represents a highly complex model, with a size exceeding 1.2 GB, while its performance is likely superior. Segmentation VGG-19  [8] is another large model, with a size of 676.88 MB. While slightly more efficient than FMAE, it remains computationally prohibitive for many applications. EmoNeXt  [9]  and Ensemble ResMaskingNet  [10]  represent lightweight models that prioritize efficiency. Ensemble ResMaskingNet, in particular, demonstrates an optimal design for low-resource environments, with only 21.3 million parameters and a size of 85.15 MB.\n\nResEmoteNet  [11] sits between these extremes, providing a balance between high performance and computational efficiency. With a size of 320.95 MB and 80.2 million parameters, it is more resource-efficient than models like FMAE and Segmentation VGG-19 but not as lightweight as Ensemble ResMaskingNet. ResEmoteNet achieves this balance by integrating advanced features such as squeeze-andexcitation (SE) blocks and residual connections, which enhance its classification performance but add to its computational requirements as illustrated in Fig.  1 .\n\nThe increasing demand for real-time FER systems has prompted the development of lightweight architectures that reduce computational complexity while maintaining accuracy. MobileNet  [11]  significantly reduced the number of parameters and floating-point operations by implementing depthwise separable convolutions. EfficientNet  [13]  advanced lightweight architectures through the use of a compound scaling strategy that methodically modified network dimensions to strike a balance between accuracy and efficiency. Despite significant advancements, lightweight architectures frequently struggle to handle imbalanced datasets and subtle emotional expressions. These challenges highlight the importance of hybrid approaches that combine lightweight design principles with optimization techniques such as knowledge distillation.\n\nKnowledge distillation, introduced by  [14] , reduces the computational demands of deep learning models by transferring knowledge from a large, high-performing teacher model to a smaller student model. This process enables the student model to mimic the teacher's behavior while operating with significantly reduced resources, making it particularly valuable for real-time FER applications. Loss functions, such as distillation loss and cross-entropy loss, balance imitating the teacher, and aligning with ground truth labels. T and Alpha hyper-parameter fine-tune the distillation process, ensuring accuracy and efficiency in the student model. Knowledge distillation has optimized resource-intensive models like vision transformers and SE-enhanced CNNs for real-time use  [15] . It enables smaller models to inherit the strengths of their larger counterparts while improving generalizability to diverse real-world conditions, such as varying lighting and occlusions.\n\nTo close these gaps and enhance ResEmoteNet for usability testing applications, In this paper, ResEmoteNet is used as a teacher model and applies knowledge distillation to create lightweight adaptations that will improve computational performance in student models. ResEmoteNet has been chosen as it outperforms state-of-the-art models across four FER databases  [11] .",

The input data is subsequently propagated through the student model for processing. Fig.  2  illustrates the proposed method.\n\nIn the mechanism of Soft Target Distillation, temperature scaling is implemented via the temperature hyper-parameter T to smooth the probability distributions, thereby enhancing the efficacy of knowledge distillation. This smoothing is achieved by dividing the logits by T before the application of the softmax function. The teacher model's softened logits convey comprehensive information regarding class relationships, thereby simplifying the learning process to a certain degree. The use of the KL divergence loss facilitates the transfer of knowledge between the teacher and student soft predictions, seemingly enabling accelerated training. Where 𝑃 𝑖,𝑐 is the \"softened\" probability distribution of the teacher model and 𝑄 𝑖,𝑐 is the \"softened\" probability distribution of the student model. In the context of Hard Label Learning, the Cross-entropy loss is employed to guarantee that the student model sustains its accuracy concerning the primary task while preserving direct supervision through ground truth labels; this loss can be calculated between the predictions of the student model and the ground truth labels.\n\nWhere C is the number of classes, 𝑦 𝑖,𝑐 is the ground truth label for class c (1 for the correct class, 0 otherwise), 𝑦`𝑖 ,𝑐 is the predicted probability (softmax output) for class c for sample i.

      "text": "This subsection presents an overview of the datasets utilized in this study. Our experimental investigations were conducted using two datasets: FER2013  [16]  and RAF-DB  [17] . Our facial emotion recognition task aims to identify seven fundamental emotions: Angry, Disgust, Fear, Happy, Neutral, Sad, and Surprise.  The FER2013 dataset is Ideal for benchmarking and developing models for controlled conditions. Its lower resolution and noise make it a good dataset for testing noise Through evaluation of temperature values 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5, it was determined that a temperature of 3 consistently resulted in superior performance. This is likely attributable to the fact that a temperature of 3 offered an ideal balance between capturing intricate class relationships and preserving a robust training signal. Furthermore, the softer target probabilities achieved at T=3 may have enabled the student model to generalize more effectively by assimilating broader class representations, thereby avoiding overfitting the teacher's most confident predictions. Additionally, experimentation with alpha values ranging from 0.10, 0.15, and 0.20 demonstrated that alphas of 0.15 and 0.20 were optimal, as the model's performance reached saturation at these points, indicating an ideal equilibrium between learning from the teacher's soft labels and the ground truth labels. This equilibrium allowed the student models to adeptly capture nuanced inter-class relationships while maintaining adherence to the hard-label classification task.\n\nOur experimental evaluations were executed utilizing the PyTorch framework on an NVIDIA Tesla P100 GPU infrastructure provided by Kaggle. In assessing the performance of our facial emotion recognition system, we employed Accuracy (%) as the principal metric, defined as:  [11]  where TP is True Positive, TN is True Negative, FP is False Positive, and FN is False Negative.",
