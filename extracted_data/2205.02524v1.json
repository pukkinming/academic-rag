      "text": "Emotion recognition in conversation (ERC) has now attracted increasing attention as its potential ability to mine and analyze the connections from the heavily incremental volume of publicly available conversational data  [3]   [9] . Furthermore, ERC can be used as a tool for psychological analysis in healthcare systems  [28]  and human-interacted emotion-aware conversation that requires an understanding of the user's emotions  [31]   [6] .\n\nTraditional machine learning methods according to textual features such as Naïve Bayes classifier  [35] , NLTK vader  [5] , etc, have been proposed for ERC task  [34] . As deep learning develops, many neural networks models are employed to classify the emotion at each utterance.  [27]  uses autoencoder to detect multiple emotions in conversation transcripts. Graph convolutional networks are exploited by  [23]  and  [42]  to model the inter-relationship between conversation topic and its different parties for better emotion representations.  [14]  employs LSTM cells and Bert hierarchically for utterance context considering the sequential essence of the conversation, which was followed by  [29]  firstly using recurrent neural network (RNN) to recognize emotions. Moreover, many NLP techniques and ideas are introduced in ERC.  [10]  incorporates different elements of commonsense and builds upon them to learn interactions between all conversation parties, and  [44]  proposes contextaware affective graph attention mechanism to interpret contextual utterances hierarchically.\n\nWhile solving the ERC task by unimodal (mostly textual) data is not enough because not only that the emotions are subjective mixed feelings  [6] , but also the labeling difficulty in real-life conversation scenarios. Through multiple channels, humans express emotions and feelings (such as voice speech, textual meaning, facial expression, body gestures, movements) provides multimodal data. Multimodal emotion recognition systems are studied alongside unimodal solutions as they offer higher accuracy of classification  [1] . Many systems consider multimodal data for ERC.  [13] ,  [12]  and  [21]  introduce attention mechanism in conversation context extraction by pooling all proceeding global states related to concatenated utterance modalities. To better fuse multi modalities under different representation spaces,  [32] ,  [36] ,  [15]  propose kinds of novel crossmodality modules to capture intra-and inter-modal influence.\n\nIn the real world, however, data often suffer from utterance-level incompleteness  [19]  with various patterns, which greatly degrades the integration and complement between different modalities. For the ERC task, there are various causes for desired data to be temporarily missing: sensors can fail so that the corresponding signal is no longer available, or its outcome may be corrupted by noise. In another situation, faces with obvious expressions may be blocked or move drastically and then disappear from the view of the sensor  [39] .\n\nFew works focus on the modality-missing problem at utterance level. Typical data imputation algorithm  [37] [24]  [40]  are aimed at separate, non-sequential data.  [26]  pad missing modalities by zeros or repeated data with advanced training strategies.  [43]  learns robust joint multimodal representations by bidirectional encoders with cascade-connected residual imagination module.  [7]  performs infinite imputations by integrating all modalities, which was followed by  [25]  which leverages several classifiers under all combinations of different modalities. By building features reconstruction module,  [20]  employs Bayesian neural network to employ data uncertainty as feature regularization. This paper deals with the utterance-level modalities missing problem with uncertain patterns on emotion recognition in conversation (ERC) task. We propose a novel framework Missing-Modality Robust emotion Recognition (M2R2), which trains emotion recognition model with iterative data augmentation by learned common representation.\n\nWe first introduce Party Attentive Network (PANet), which tracks all the speakers' states and context. Attention mechanism between speaker with other participants and dialogue topic is used to decentralize dependence on multi-time and multi-party utterances instead of the possible incomplete one. Moreover, we define the Common Representation Learning (CRL) problem for modality-missing data augmentation. Data imputation methods improved by the adversarial strategy are used here to construct extra features. Extensive experiments and case studies validate the effectiveness of our methods over baselines for modalitymissing emotion recognition on two different datasets. The contributions are summarized as follows:\n\n1. We propose a novel M2R2 framework with iterative data augmentation on missing-modality datasets, which alleviate the performance decline caused by modalities incompleteness greatly.",

      "text": "Apparently the emotion e t is mainly determined by the utterance u t . In addition, we assume that (1) the conversation scene has context by proceeding utterances; (2) every party(speaker) has its emotional context by its utterances 3) the emotion of one party is affected by the other party's emotion context.\n\nOur PANet model is shown in Fig.  2(b ). We model the conversation scene state by global state, which is updated by the previous speaker's party-states, emotional states and current speaker's utterance, to encode shared information between all parties. It tracks party state, emotional state and utterance of all parties, using all proceeding global state jointly with utterance to get global context for party state.\n\nFurthermore, each party is modeled by party state, which changes as a new utterance flows in, tracking parties' dynamic representation related to the emotional state. Like global context, all proceeding party states with utterance are exploited to get party context for emotion state. Finally, the model infers the emotional states of different parties from the corresponding party states along with other parties'. The emotional states are then sent to the classification head to get the label. Global State The purpose of global state (g ∈ R D G , D G represents dimension) is to model and track conversation scene and shared information between its parties. Current state g t focuses on current utterance's impact while proceeding global ones g 1 , . . . , g t-1 reveals the change of conversation representation, which provide meaningful context for party state. At time t, the global state g t updated through GRU G as follows:\n\nwhere\n\nis the previous speaker's party state, e q I(t- To fully take the global state into consideration, we employ Attention Mechanism  [38]  to calculate global context c g t = ATTN([g 1 , g 2 , . . . , g t ], u t ) related to current utterance:\n\nwhere α t ∈ R t-1 is the attention weight which will be higher for important factors assigned for all proceeding global state related to current utterance, c t ∈ R D G is the weighted sum of proceeding global state by α t . The scheme of attention module for global is shown in Fig.  2(b ). Then party state p q is updated respectively by employing global context, current utterance and previous emotion state: p q t = GRU q P (p q t-1 , u t ⊕ c t ⊕ e q t-1 ), q ∈ {1, 2, . . . , Q}, (6) where p q t-1 is previous party state, e q t-1 is previous emotional state. Notice that party attention updates using its party and emotion state instead of the previous speaker's, which is different from global states. Emotion State We assume that every party in the conversation has its emotional state behind party state and is affected by other ones, and it varies under different global states. It shows how the conversation scene and other parties' state can affect party emotion. Thus we exploit all parties' state related to global state to represent party context:\n\nwhere function ATTN is defined as Eq.(  5 ), p q t is the state of party q at time t and c pq t ∈ R D P is the party context of p q . The scheme of attention module for party context is shown in Fig.  2(b) .\n\nAll the party context {c p1 t , c p2 t , . . . , c p Q t } and current global state g t are then used to update emotion state by\n\nwhere e q t ∈ R E . Emotion Classification Head We employ a simple perceptron C to classify the speaker's emotion state as final emotion label: ŷt = arg max C(e\n\nwhere ŷt is the predicted emotion label. Finally, we employ categorical cross-entropy along with L2-regularization as the objective function:\n\nwhere x, y is the time-sequence data with labels, T is the total number of utterance in a conversation, P t is the distribution of emotion labels for utterance u t , y t is the ground truth, λ E is the L-2 weight and Θ E represents the parameters of PANet model.",

Learning common representation is guided simultaneously by observed data, unobserved data and labels. The adversarial loss is calculated by wasserstein GAN(WGAN)  [11]  as:\n\nwhere ûm = f m (h n ; Θ m u ) is the generated missing view data, P G = ( ∇ ûm D m (û m ) 2 -1) 2 is the gradient penalty in WGAN and λ G is the balanced parameter.

Additional hidden representations are not used here.\n\nComparison results of IEMOCAP&MELD datasets are shown in Fig  3 , where there are the following observations: 1) Our PANet model performs better at both accuracy and F1-score than baselines when the dataset is complete; 2) As missing rate η increases, the degradation of our model is much faint than baselines, especially on MELD dataset.

The attention weight of all conversation turns related to chosen turns shows that neighboring and distant utterances can influence the current emotional state. For example, the emotion at turn 7, where the model correctly predicts 'Disgust', is influenced by the nearby utterance at turn 2 and the distant utterance at turn 43.\n\nA similar dependency trend is also shared by party attention mechanism such as the nearby utterance at turn 6 and the distant utterance at turn 39 both influence the current emotion prediction at turn 7.\n\n(2) Dependency on future utterances. The figure also reveals that future utterances can influence the proceeding emotion greatly. In this discussion, we can observe that the turn 7 contributes almost half to proceeding turn 7 of global attention α G and similarly, turn 36, 37 and turn 39 have a significant influence on their proceeding turn 7 of α P1 , α P2 respectively.\n\n(3) Dependency on different parties. Like common sense in daily life, one speaker's emotional state changes from the speaker's internal shift and other speakers' influence. For example, both turn 8 and 43 strongly attend to the emotion prediction of turn 7 while turn 8 is  uttered by party q I(8) and turn 43 belongs to the other party.\n\nTo avoid the exception error in analysis, we test the global attention weight at all turns in a conversation scene of the IEMOCAP dataset. The Fig.  6  shows the result. As can be observed, early utterances attend to early scene emotion prediction more strongly than other times and accordingly, late utterances attend more strongly to late scene emotion prediction.
