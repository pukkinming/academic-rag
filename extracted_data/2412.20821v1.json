      "text": "Multimodal emotion recognition (MER), leveraging speech and text, has emerged as a pivotal domain within human-computer interaction, demanding sophisticated methods for effective multimodal integration. The challenge of aligning features across these modalities is significant, with most existing approaches adopting a singular alignment strategy. Such a narrow focus not only limits model performance but also fails to address the complexity and ambiguity inherent in emotional expressions. In response, this paper introduces a Multi-Granularity Cross-Modal Alignment (MGCMA) framework, distinguished by its comprehensive approach encompassing distribution-based, instance-based, and token-based alignment modules. This framework enables a multi-level perception of emotional information across modalities.

      "text": "Emotion recognition is an important aspect of humancomputer interaction. Extensive research has been conducted on unimodal emotion recognition  [1, 2] . However, emotions are conveyed in a variety of ways. Speech and text are both important carriers of emotional information  [3] . Multimodal emotion recognition (MER), integrating speech and text, has gained significant attention  [4] . By fusing information from multiple modalities, such as prosodic features from speech and semantic cues from text, MER aims to capture a more comprehensive understanding of human emotions. In recent years, MER has been widely used in many applications across various domains  [5, 6] .\n\nIn the field of MER, the heterogeneity across modalities makes the alignment of multimodal features become a hot research topic. Effective alignment methods are crucial for leveraging complementary information from different modalities. Sun et al.  [8]  employ a fine-grained alignment component to obtain modality-shared representations and capture modal consistency. Liu et al.  [9]  integrate the alignment module with a silence removal technology, achieving accurate alignment of speech and text. These approaches have yielded favorable results in MER. However, they have not fully addressed the ambiguity inherent in emotional expressions  [10] , which can compromise the quality of alignment. Drawing inspiration †Corresponding author. This work was supported by the National Key R&D Program of China (Grant No.2022ZD0116307) and NSF China (Grant No.62271270). from  [11] , leveraging distribution-level representation as a higher-dimensional tool for coarse-grained alignment offers a promising approach to model such ambiguity.\n\nOn the other hand, to achieve fine-grained alignment and uncover potential mapping relationships between multimodal inputs, various innovative alignment strategies have been proposed. Among these, the cross-modal attention mechanism stands out, having been extensively applied to facilitate tokenlevel alignment in numerous studies  [12, 13] . For instance, Liu et al.  [14]  devise an attention-based bidirectional alignment network to map the alignment between speech and text. To address the challenges of emotional asynchrony and modality misalignment in MER, Fan et al.  [15]  introduce a novel multi-granularity attention mechanism to enhance alignment accuracy. However, token-level alignment predominantly concentrates on local information, frequently overlooking the global context. This oversight can, to some extent, compromise the model's overall performance when token-level alignment is applied in isolation.\n\nConversely, contrastive learning has emerged as an innovative method for achieving instance-level multimodal feature alignment  [16, 17] . This approach, by maximizing the similarity between positive pairs and minimizing it for negative pairs, enables the model to develop more generalized representations. Empirical evidence underscores the effectiveness of contrastive learning in enhancing multimodal alignment. Nonetheless, the scope of existing research is often limited to single-level alignment-either at the token or instance level-thereby restricting the model's ability to fully grasp emotional information across different levels.\n\nIn this paper, to address the aforementioned challenges in MER, we introduce a novel Multi-Granularity Cross-Modal Alignment (MGCMA) framework which comprises distribution-based, token-based, and instance-based alignment modules. The distribution-based alignment module, implemented through distribution-level contrastive learning, acts as a coarse-grained alignment from a higher-dimensional perspective, accommodating the ambiguity of emotions. By aligning distribution representations that encapsulate richer information, it sets the stage for more nuanced alignments and interactions. The token-based alignment module employs selfattention and cross-attention mechanisms to accurately match and align local cross-modal representations between speech and text. This fine-grained alignment facilitates the exchange of information across modalities, which is advantageous for",

The results are shown in Table  II , where DAM, TAM and IAM denotes the distribution-based, token-based and instancebased alignment module, respectively. More detailed analysis are discussed below.\n\nImportance of Different Granularity Alignment Modules. Upon examining the results in Table  II , it becomes apparent that DAM exerts the most significant influence on the overall framework. Within a multimodal framework, alignment at a high-dimensional level enables the model to facilitate more effective token-based and instance-based alignments subsequently.\n\nThe effect of TAM is demonstrated by comparing the results of S0 and S2. Incorporating TAM allows features from one modality to assimilate information from the other modality, thereby augmenting the interaction among local features pertinent to emotion.\n\nA comparison between the results of S0 and S3 highlights the efficacy of IAM. This module compels the framework to position matched speech-text pairs closer, while distancing unmatched pairs. With better distributions in the latent space, the model can obtain a stronger recognition capacity.\n\nTo intuitively illustrate the distribution of speech and text features under various alignment strategies, we employ the t-SNE technique  [27]   Importance of the sequence of different alignment mod-To further investigate the impact of varying sequences of alignment modules on the results, we shuffle the order of these modules. The performances are documented in Table  III .\n\nIt can be observed that the S0 alignment sequence yields the most favorable outcomes. Serving as a higher-dimensional feature, distribution representation contains more information than conventional methods. The distribution-based alignment  module enhances the consistency of various segments in an utterance, playing a pivotal role in elevating the performance of token-based alignment. Through the token-based alignment module, the model focuses more on local information pertinent to the other modality, extracting features critical for emotion recognition. Subsequently, the instance-based alignment module strengthens the association of multimodal features and fosters accurate correlation between the correct speech-text pairs, which facilitates the instance-based downstream task.\n\nAltering the sequence of the alignment modules disrupts the model's ability to develop a multi-level perception of emotional information, which can be detrimental to performance.",
