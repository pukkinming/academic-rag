      "text": "Title: Vision based body gesture meta features for Affective Computing Early detection of psychological distress is key to effective treatment. Automatic detection of distress, such as depression, is an active area of research. Current approaches utilise vocal, facial, and bodily modalities. Of these, the bodily modality is the least investigated, partially due to the difficulty in extracting bodily representations from videos, and partially due to the lack of viable datasets. Existing body modality approaches use automatic categorization of expressions to represent body language as a series of specific expressions, much like words within natural language. In this dissertation I present a new type of feature, within the body modality, that represents meta information of gestures, such as speed, and use it to predict a non-clinical depression label. This differs to existing work by representing overall behaviour as a small set of aggregated meta features derived from a person's movement. In my method I extract pose estimation from videos, detect gestures within body parts, extract meta information from individual gestures, and finally aggregate these features to generate a small feature vector for use in prediction tasks. No existing, publicly available, dataset for distress analysis contains source videos of participants or pose data extracted from the source videos. As such, I introduce a new dataset of 65 video recordings of interviews with self-evaluated distress, personality, and demographic labels. This dataset enables the development of features utilising the whole body in distress detection tasks. I evaluate my newly introduced meta-features for predicting depression, anxiety, perceived stress, somatic stress, five standard personality measures, and gender. A linear regression based classifier using these features achieves a 82.70% F1 score for predicting depression within my novel dataset. My results suggest this feature type has value for distress prediction and, more broadly, has potential within the affective computing domain, as they appear to be useful aggregate representations of human behaviour.",

Awareness of its effects and symptoms, destigmatization of its results, consideration of its causes, and approaches to its treatment and diagnosis, in the case of illness, are all rapidly evolving. According to the UK Mental Health Foundation  [41] , depression is the \"predominant mental health problem worldwide\". Within the UK in 2014, 19.7% of people over the age of 16 showed symptoms of depression or anxiety. Early detection is paramount to long term health, 10% of children aged 5-16 years have a clinically diagnosable mental health issue, of children who have experienced mental health problems 70% do not have their issues detected or addressed early enough  [41] .",

      "text": "Automatic distress detection enables large scale early screening. Early screening can be used to enable mitigation of distress at an earlier stage that it might otherwise be identified and also prioritization of services. For example, Crisis Text Line  [12]  (CTL) provides a free mental health counseling service via text messages. The communication medium means consumers can message without a counselor being exclusively available. To better support those consumers most in need (e.g. those most at risk of suicide), CTL analyses text messages in real time to triage consumers for counselor attention  [15] . While the CTL example is a specific use case with a single modality, text, the broader area of distress detection uses many modalities including facial, eye, head, vocal, bodily, and speech. Existing work has investigated usage of psychology coding systems such as FACS levels of activity in eye and head movement  [1, 55, 16] , orientation of eye gaze and head  [46] , fundamental frequencies and biomarkers of vocal recordings  [43, 2] , automatic categorization of body expressions  [36, 34, 51] , and natural language artifacts from speech  [13] . Moreover, many methods incorporate multiple modalities and achieve significantly better results.\n\nOne of the difficulties in this area is the lack of available and relevant datasets. Distress focused datasets are not readily shared given the sensitive nature of the subject. Those that are shared rarely include source data, but rather provide processed outputs, again due to the sensitive of the subject. Finally, each modality has different source data requirements and datasets are generally designed with a specific method in mind. All of this creates a barrier to the development of novel features and thus research within this area is concentrated on the modalities available within the few public datasets.",

Per-gesture these features are cheap to compute and relatively simplistic, aggregated across all gestures they aim to represent general behavioural characteristics of a subject.\n\nI evaluate the use of these features for detecting depression (non-clinical) and find that they provide useful predictive information within linear models. I then evaluate the generalisability of these features by applying them to classification tasks for other distress and personality labels.\n\nAs I noted earlier, a core barrier to the development of new features within the body modality is the lack of available distress datasets that expose the required source data. As such I introduce a novel audio-visual dataset gathered for this dissertation in collaboration with Dr. Marwa Mahmoud. The dataset contains audio-visual recordings of semi-structured interviews and labels based on established psychology self-evaluation questionnaires for distress and personality measures.",

      "text": "Joshi et al.  [36]  present a \"bag of facial dynamics\" depression detection method based on the same expression clustering as their \"bag of body dynamics\" method described in more depth below. For this facial method the space-time interest points (STIPs) are generated for face aligned versions of the source videos.\n\nWhile Joshi et al. use a categorization approach, Dibeklioglu et al.  [16]  use generic features representing facial movement dynamics for depression detection. This method involves generating statistical derivations from movement features such as velocity, acceleration, and facial displacement over a time period and then modeling their effect.\n\nWhilst Dibeklioglu et al. take a generic approach to facial movement, Syed et al.  [55]  attempt to model behaviour discussed in psychology literature, using features representing psychomotor retardation to predict depression severity. Psychomotor retardation has been shown to be linked to depression  [50] . In particular, Syed et al. generate features to capture craniofacial movements that represent psychomotor retardation, and thus indicate depression. To capture the target movements they design features that represent muscular tightening, a depressed subject is expected to have impaired muscle movements. They model three types of movement: head movement, mouth movement, and eyelid movement. These movements are represented by temporal deltas to define the amount of movement in the region. From these localised movement deltas the authors aim to represent specific actions such as blinking or contorting of the mouth. Relatively simplistic features derived from these actions, such as blink rate, can be indicative of depression  [3, 19] . The nature of human behaviour is that these kinds of simplistic features can contribute useful information to distress detection models. Moreover, modeling specific facial actions has been examined as well. For example, Scherer et al.  [46]  use smile features such as intensity and duration, along with other modalities, to detect depression.\n\nYang et al.  [58]  present a novel facial descriptor, a \"Histogram of Displacement Range (HDR)\", which describes the amount of movement of facial landmarks. The histogram counts the number of occurrences of a displacement within a certain range of movement. Where Syed et al. represented the amount of movement of certain facial features to measure psychomotor retardation, Yang et al. represent the number of times the face is distorted, so to speak, by landmarks moving a certain amount.\n\nEye Sub-Modality While Syed et al.  [55]  explored the use of eye lid features, eye gaze features have also been shown to be effective in predicting distress. This modality has become viable as eye tracking technology has progressed sufficiently to enable accurate processing of eye features.\n\nAlghowinem et al.  [1]  use eye gaze/activity to perform binary classification of depression in cross-cultural datasets. They extract iris and eyelid movements to extract features such as blink rate, duration of closed eyes, and statistical \"functionals\" (i.e. simple derivations) of the amount of activity. However, activity is not the only indicator, Scherer et al.  [46]  use average eye gaze vertical orientation (among other features), in the span  [-60, 60]  degrees.",

They use three facial landmarks, the corner of each eye and the tip of the nose, to compute the orientation of the subject's head. The histogram uses orientation bins of width 10 within the range [-90, 90] degrees for windows of time within a video. These windowed histograms are then averaged over the full length of the video. The resulting average histogram is a descriptor of the amount of movement within the video by representing the variety of angles the head orients to. This method achieves comparable performance to their \"bag of facial dynamics\" method.\n\nA number of the methods using eye activity features also incorporate head activity in their models. Alghowinem et al.  [1]  model head activity similarly to their modeling of eye activity. As with eye activity, they extract statistical derivations of movement and angular shift. They also include the duration of the head at different orientations, the rate of change of orientation, and the total number of orientation changes. Scherer et al.  [46]  use head vertical orientation, similar to their eye gaze orientation feature, as a feature for predicting depression. They use the average pitch of the head within a 3D head orientation model.

Though a parallel field, the core argument is much the same for affective computing's investigation of bodily expressions. Specifically, at the time of writing (2009) de Gelder asserts that 95% of \"social and affective neuroscience\" focuses on faces and that the remaining 5% is mostly split between vocal, musical, and environmental modalities with a very few number of papers investigating the body modality. This was similar to the state of automatic distress detection in the early 2010s, though the vocal modality has a more prominent position in the literature and is more evenly balanced with the facial modality.\n\nAffectation control and robust automatic detection Non-verbal features provide discriminative information regardless of a person's conscious communication, this is particularly important for automatic distress detection. Different modalities can be consciously controlled to varying degrees. For example, facial expressions are more easily controlled than bodily expressions  [14] . By including more modalities, and representations of those modalities, automatic distress detection could become more robust to conscious affectation modification of modalities.\n\nFurther to robustness, one of the advantages of the face and body modalities is their ability to detect micro-expressions. Micro-expressions are instinctual reactions to some stimulus that can be predictive of emotional and distress state  [20, 28] . They are significantly harder to control than general expressions.",

      "text": "Much of the body modality research has approached the problem as a transfer of the methods from the facial modality by modeling body movements as expressions in much the same way facial expressions are  [33, 36, 34] . Differences in these methods have been centred around: what tracklets form the basis of the body data  [36] , the use of deep learning vs manual descriptor definition  [46] , and process for generating categories of expressions  [51] .\n\nJoshi et al.  [36]  demonstrate the discriminative power of bodily expressions for predicting clinically based depression measures. They use STIPs from recordings of a participant's upper body and generate a \"Bag of Body Dynamics (BoB)\" based on codebooks of expression representations. STIPs are generated for a video, then Histograms of Gradient (HoG) and Optical Flow (HoF) are computed spatio-temporally around the STIPs, these histograms are then clustered within a sample, the cluster centres form a representation of the movements occurring in the video. The cluster centres from all videos in a training set are clustered again to generate the codebook of expressions. A BoB feature vector is generated for each sample by counting the number of cluster centres within the sample that fit within each codebook expression. Finally, these BoB feature vectors are used by an SVM to detect depression.\n\nJoshi et al.  [34]  extend on this approach by combining a \"holistic body analysis\", similar to the BoB method, this method uses STIPs for whole body motion analysis and adds relative body part features. These features represent the movement of the head and limbs relative to the participant's trunk, represented as polar histograms.\n\nApplying the same essential method as Joshi et al.,  Song et al. [51]  present a method for learning a codebook of facial and bodily micro-expressions. They identify micro-expressions by extracting STIPs over very short time intervals (e.g. a few hundred milliseconds), then, as Joshi et al. do, they compute local spatio-temporal features around the STIPs and learn a codebook of expressions based on these local features. Finally, for each sample they generate a Bag-of-Words style feature vector based on the codified micro-expressions present in the sample.",

Specifically, they manually annotate their dataset for hand self-adaptor behaviours and fidgets, including hand tapping, stroking, grooming, playing with hands or hair, and similar behaviours. To identify whether regions are relevant to these behaviours they also annotate these behaviours with categories such as head, hands, arms, and torso, and then extract statistical information such as the average duration of self-adaptors in each region. They also annotate leg fidgeting behaviour such as leg shaking and foot tapping, again they use statistical derivations of these behaviours as features for detection.\n\nWhilst Scherer et al. manually annotated self-adaptors and fidgets, Mahmoud et al.  [40]  present an automatic detector of fidgeting, and similar behaviours, based on a novel rhythmic motion descriptor. They extract SURF interest point tracklets from colour and depth data and then apply their novel rhythmic measure to check similarity among cyclic motion across tracklets.

      "text": "Combining modalities for prediction has proven effective when combining a variety of modalities  [58, 35, 16] . There are four primary types of fusion: feature fusion such as feature vector concatenation, decision fusion such as majority vote, hybrid fusion which uses both, and deep learning fusion which merges inner representations of features within a deep learning architecture. The deep learning fusion method differs from feature fusion as the features are provided to separate input layers and only merged after inner layers, but before decision layers.\n\nSong et al.  [51]  combine micro-expressions from facial and bodily modalities with sample-level audio features. They evaluate three methods, early fusion by concatenating audio features to features from each visual frame, early fusion using a CCA  [30]  kernel, and late fusion based on voting, where the per-frame predictions from the visual modalities are averaged over the sample and then combined with the audio prediction. Dibeklioglu et al.  [16]  fuse facial, head, and vocal modalities using feature concatenation. They extend on this by performing feature selection on the concatenated vector, rather than the source vectors, using the Min-Redundancy Max-Relevance algorithm  [45] .\n\nAlghowinem et al.  [1]  perform hybrid modality fusion, both combining feature vectors from modalities and performing a majority vote on individual modality classification predictions. The vote fusion is based on three classifiers, two mono-modal classifiers and one feature fusion classifier.\n\nHuang et al.  [31]  train long-short-term memory (LSTM) models on facial, vocal, and text modalities and then use a decision level fusion, via a SVR, to predict the final regression values. This paper differs from many deep learning approaches as it uses the decision level fusion, rather than having the deep learning models find patterns across feature types.  [25]  present another approach to usage of multiple modalities where the text modality provides contextualisation for features from the audio-visual modalities. They apply a topic modeling method for depression detection using vocal and facial modalities, where features are grouped based on the topic being responded to within an interview. The authors suggest that without topic modeling the features are averaged over too large a time period such that all temporal information is lost. By segmenting the samples they aim to retain some of the temporal information. Arbitrary segmentation would not necessarily be useful, thus their use of logical segmentation based on topic.",

In distress detection most modalities provide sequence data, audio-visual streams, natural language, or sequence descriptors of the data (such as FACS AUs).\n\nChen et al.  [9]  present a method utilizing text, vocal, and facial modalities for emotion recognition. They explore the use of existing vocal features such as fundamental frequency analysis, auto-learnt features based on pre-trained CNNs to extract vocal and facial features, and word embedding features for the text. The auto-learnt facial features are derived from existing facial appearance data already extracted from the raw videos (i.e. they do not have their CNNs process raw frames to extract features). They then experiment with SVR and LSTM models to evaluate the temporal value of the LSTM model. They find that fused auto-learnt features from all modalities in combination with the LSTM model provides the greatest performance.\n\nYang et al.  [59]  present an interesting multi-level fusion method that incorporates text, vocal, and facial modalities. They design a Deep Convolutional Neural Network (DCNN) to Deep Neural Network (DNN) regression model that is trained, separately, for audio and video modalities. They also trained their regression models separately for depressed and non-depressed participants, resulting in four separate DCNN -DNN models. They use the openSMILE toolkit for their audio features, this is common among many of the vocal modality methods (e.g. Alghowinem et al. from above), and FACS AUs for their visual features. They derive a temporally relevant feature vector from the set of all AUs by calculating the change in AUs over time. Their text modality model uses Paragraph Vectors in combination with SVMs and random forests and predicts a classification task rather than a regression task. Finally, they fuse, using DNNs, the audio and visual model predictions per training set, i.e. the depressed participant trained models are fused and the non-depressed models are fused. They then use another DNN to fuse the two fused regression predictions (i.e. depressed and non-depressed) and the classification prediction from the text modality. While they use DNNs to fuse decisions at multiple levels, this is a decision-level fusion method, not a deep learning fusion method, as they fuse the regression predictions from each model rather than the inner layer outputs.\n\nYang et al.  [58]  present a second paper which utilises the same structure of DCNNs and DNNs, with two significant changes: firstly, the video features are changed to a new global descriptor they present, the \"Histogram of Displacement Range (HDR)\" which describes the amount of movement of facial landmarks, and secondly, the text modality now uses the same DCNN -DNN architecture to perform regression based on text data. Having changed the output of the text model the final fusion is a regression fusion using the same method as the audio visual models were fused in the first paper.\n\nFinally, no method, that I am aware of, uses deep learning end-to-end for automatic distress detection such that features are learnt from raw data for predicting distress. All methods apply deep learning on top of audio-visual descriptors and hand-crafted features. One of the core difficulties is the relative sparsity of existing data and thus the restricted ability to learn interesting features. Therefore, continued development of features and approaches to behavioural representation is valuable and able to contribute to methods that use deep learning.",

Examples of these generic features are Space-Time Interest Points (STIPs), SURF, Histogram of Gradients (HOGs) and Optical Flow (HOFs), among others. These features can be extracted from colour and depth recordings such that they are applicable to both 2D and 3D recordings.\n\nWhile some approaches apply these generic features (or rather, derivations of these features) directly to prediction tasks  [36, 51]  (examples are discussed in Section 2.1), others aim to incorporate heuristics and information based on body parts. For example, interest points can be segmented based on location within the frame to heuristically distinguish body parts (e.g. head and arms)  [34] .\n\nAnother example is Mahmoud et al.  [40]  who use SURF keypoints from colour and depth images across a video to define tracklets for their rhythmic motion measure. Their dataset is based on Kinect captured videos to provide depth, this also provides skeletal regions such as feet and head. They use these Kinect skeletal regions to localise their keypoints' motion.",

In the past three to four years there has been substantial work on these pose estimation systems  [57, 7, 49, 60, 39] . The current state-of-the-art is OpenPose by Cao et al.  [8] . OpenPose uses skeletal hierarchy and part affinity fields to estimate pose interest points (i.e. joints) relative to each other and determine both part and orientation based on the direction of the proposed limb. The state-of-the-art model, at the time of writing, generates 25 interest points identifying the location of all major joints and more detailed information regarding head and feet.

Partial failures suggest a simple failure of OpenPose to extend through its body hierarchy.

This ensures differences in dominant hand between participants will not affect the result.\n\nHead While OpenPose includes face detection, providing detailed facial landmarks, I use the general head position points provided by the standard pose detection component.\n\nLegs I represent legs using the knee pose points from OpenPose. As with hands, I process gestures in each leg independently and then aggregate to a single feature vector.\n\nFeet Each foot is comprised of four pose points within OpenPose. Aggregation is the same as hands and legs.\n\nTrunk I do not include a \"trunk\" localisation as there is minimal movement in the trunk, given the seated nature of the dataset interviews. Though some participants may lean forwards and backwards, these movements are not represented well within my data as the camera faces the participants directly such that forwards and backwards leaning would be towards the camera, thus requiring depth perception which is not included in my data. Side to side leaning is restricted by the arms of the participant's chair. As such the localisations that are relatively free to move, those other than the trunk, are intuitively the most likely areas to provide predictive information.",

      "text": "To detect gestures within a set of pose points (e.g. finger tips, knees, feet, head, etc) I scan the activity of the target points for sustained periods of movement. The gesture detection step takes cleaned per-frame pose estimations and outputs a collection of ranges of non-overlapping frames that contain gestures within the localisation.\n\nFirst, the per-frame absolute movement delta is calculated for each pose point. The movement is then averaged across all localisation pose points. Movement deltas are L 2 distances. Formally, M p,t = P p,t -P p,t-1\n\nwhere M p,t is the amount of movement for pose point p at time t, P p,t is the position value of pose point p at time t, and F t is the averaged per-frame movement across all points. Second, I average the movement of each frame within a window such that a small number of frames do not have a disproportionate effect on the detection. That is,\n\nwhere W i is the windowed average at window index i, l is the length of the window, and F t is the average movement at frame t, from Equation  4 .1. In this dissertation I use l = 10, i.e. a second of movement is represented by 3 windows, this is experimentally chosen. Third, the detector iterates through the averaged windows until a window with an average movement above a threshold is found. The first frame of this initial window is considered the beginning of the gesture. The gesture continues until n consecutive windows (I use 3, i.e. 30 frames, as an approximate of a second) are found below the movement threshold. The last frame of the final window above the movement threshold is considered the end of the gesture. This is provided more formally in Algorithm 1.\n\nHaving detected gestures in each body localisation I extract the features described above from each gesture and aggregate them to form the final feature vector.",

However, Dibeklioglu et al.  [16]  argue that basing selection on optimization of mutual information will achieve better results than individual information based selection. I follow this mutual information approach and thus feature selection is based on the results achievable given a combination of features, rather than features' individual relevance.\n\nI define few enough features such that a brute force feature combination space search (i.e. test every permutation) is viable.

This intuition is validated as these movement representations are included in a variety of feature sets resulting from feature space searches, across multiple labels. Indeed, Table  5 .9 shows that the speed of the head during a gesture (i.e. He-GA) is correlated with positive classifications for labels including neuroticism, depression, somatic stress, while it is inversely correlated with other classifications including extraversion and agreeableness.",

For example, while the hands localised gesture surprise feature (Hn-GS) is linearly correlated with somatic stress, anxiety, perceived stress, and gender, it is inconsistently correlated with conscientiousness and depression.

This risk is mitigated by two factors: the best performance is achieved by a linear regression based classifier (i.e. a classifier not prone to overfitting) and many features are present in optimal feature combinations for multiple uncorrelated labels.\n\nI compared my method to a basic facial-modality method and an existing body-modality method based on STIPs (i.e. generic analysis of video data). My method outperforms both when using the lin classifier, both when using all possible features and when using the optimal feature combination for the depression label.\n\nFinally, I perform a multi-modal experiment utilising the facial-modality comparison method and my novel gesture meta features. Despite testing multiple approaches to fusion, no method I evaluated beat the mono-modal gesture meta features classifiers. However, all related work that I am aware of achieves better performance when incorporating multiple modals, as such it is likely that further investigation of multi-modal approaches incorporating the gesture meta features will identify a multi-modal approach that does improve upon my mono-modal results.",

To develop and evaluate these features I also introduced a novel non-clinical audio-visual dataset containing recordings of semi-structured interviews along with distress and personality labels.\n\nI evaluated these features for detecting depression as a binary classification task based on PHQ-8 scores. A linear regression based classifier achieved a 82.70% average F1 score, suggesting these features are both useful for depression detection and provide linear information. I further evaluated the features' generalisability via binary classification tasks for other distress labels, such as anxiety, personality measures, and gender. All generalisation labels achieved better than 80% average F1 scores, with the exception of one label, personality neuroticism, which achieved 76.39%.\n\nThese are novel features as previous works within the body modality for automatic distress detection are based on either unsupervised definitions of expressions or handcrafted descriptors of distress indicative behaviour. These features are similar to some of the work within the eye and head modalities which are based on modeling generic activity levels within these modalities, among other features.\n\nFinally, these features exist within a broader ecosystem of affect based features. The best results for automatic distress detection, and similar tasks, is achieved by integrating multiple modalities and multiple representations of modalities. Future work may apply these features to new tasks, extend the feature type by extracting similar meta features, and develop methods for combining them with other modalities to amplify the information they provide.",

This more sophisticated measure of surprise could account for naturalistic behaviour such as rhythmic movement/gestures. These types of extensions of features are exciting for two reasons: firstly, they are interpretable, they do not come from a black box model, and thus can be supported by psychology literature.

I aggregate three core features of gestures: their movement, duration, and \"surprise\". I perform aggregation via averaging and standard deviations.
