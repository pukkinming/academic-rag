      "text": "Emotion recognition has been widely applied in various fields, including human-computer interaction, video surveillance, and smart healthcare  [49, 21, 61] . Some studies  [10, 17, 24, 29]  have shown that gait patterns (e.g., walking speed, stride length, and arm swing angles) can reflect an individual's emotional state. Compared to facial emotion recognition  [26] , gait-based methods do not require close interaction or active cooperation from subjects  [52, 28] . With the use of 3D skeletons, gait emotion recognition (GER)  [5, 32, 57]  has gained significant atten-* Corresponding Author. tion in the computer vision community.\n\nRecently, graph convolution-based methods  [4, 53, 59, 67]  have achieved significant progress, as the skeleton naturally forms a graph structure in non-Euclidean geometric spaces, where each graph node corresponds directly to a skeletal joint. Prior studies typically adopt network architectures similar to those used in action recognition, such as the Graph Convolutional Network (GCN) for spatial typology modeling and the Temporal Convolutional Network (TCN) for temporal dynamic modeling. However, research  [53]  highlights a key distinction between action recognition and emotion recognition: While action recognition primarily focuses on local joint movements, emotion recognition involves classifying emotions based on the overall body state. Consequently, TCN alone is insufficient for capturing long-range temporal dependencies, which are crucial for emotion recognition.\n\nOn the other hand, some methods employ dual-stream network architectures to capture more comprehensive emotion features. For example, BPM-GCN  [57]  is the first method that fuses human posture information and higherorder motion features by dynamic weight addition. However, this fusion manner fails to fully capture the correlation between different streams and does not effectively leverage their complementary information for improved recognition. Therefore, we employ the Transformer to align and complement features across different streams based on semantic similarity, forming a more comprehensive emotion representation.\n\nTransformer  [22, 44]  has become the dominant model in natural language processing (NLP) due to its powerful long-range modeling capabilities. Inspired by the success of NLP, numerous studies  [3, 6, 12, 31, 55, 63]  have extended its application to computer vision, achieving state-of-the-art performance. Building on this progress, researchers have explored its potential in video understanding tasks, including action recognition  [23, 50] , video generation  [14, 19] , and spatiotemporal grounding  [47, 48] . Recently, large multimodal models  [27, 30]  have also adopted transformerbased architectures. Motivated by these advancements, we incorporate transformers into skeleton-based gait emotion recognition to capture global temporal representations and bridge information gaps between different streams (i.e., posture and motion).\n\nSpecifically, in this paper, we propose a novel framework, called CGTGait, which is the first work to integrate GCNs and Transformers for skeleton-based gait emotion recognition. CGTGait adopts a dual-stream architecture comprising posture and motion streams, where each stream utilizes stacked CGT blocks to capture both framelevel spatial topology and global temporal information. Additionally, we incorporate a contrastive learning strategy within each CGT block to enhance feature discriminability and robustness by constraining the distance between confident and ambiguous samples. To further bridge spatiotemporal information gaps between the two streams, we introduce a Bidirectional Cross-Stream Fusion (BCSF) module, which utilizes the temporal cross-transformer and dynamic spatial attention to facilitate the exchange of complementary information between posture and motion features. The former facilitates long-range temporal dependencies and context awareness across frames between different streams, while the latter adaptively emphasizes key spatial typology information, ensuring a more comprehensive understanding of emotional expressions. We conduct extensive experiments on two public datasets (Emotion-Gait  [1]  and ELMD  [2] ) to validate the effectiveness of CGTGait. The results demonstrate that our method achieves superior or at least competitive performance with state-of-the-art methods while significantly reducing computational complexity by approximately 82.2% (i.e., only requiring 0.34G FLOPs) during testing (as shown in Figure  1 ).\n\nThe main contributions of this paper can be summarized as follows:\n\n• We propose CGTGait, a novel gait emotion recognition method that couples graphs and transformers to capture more discriminative spatiotemporal representations. To the best of our knowledge, CGTGait is the first method to leverage the global temporal modeling capability of transformers for skeleton-based gait emotion recognition.\n\n• We introduce BCSF, a Bidirectional Cross-Stream Fusion module that dynamically aligns posture and motion representations using the temporal crosstransformer and dynamic spatial attention, effectively bridging spatiotemporal gaps and facilitating the exchange of complementary information between posture and motion features.\n\n• Our method achieves state-of-the-art or comparable performance on two datasets (Emotion-Gait  [1]  and ELMD  [2] ), while significantly reducing test computational complexity by approximately 82.2%, requiring only 0.34G FLOPs.",

      "text": "Early studies  [9, 20, 35, 45, 8]  employ traditional machine learning methods with hand-crafted features to extract emotional information, such as Principal Component Analysis (PCA), Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA), and Support Vector Machines (SVM). For example, Li et al.  [24]  identify emotions by leveraging the discrete Fourier transform and statistical principles. However, hand-crafted feature modeling is complex, and variations across different datasets significantly hinder its generalization ability.\n\nRecently, the rapid advancement of deep learning has significantly contributed to the development of gait emotion recognition. Based on their encoding methods, deep learning models can be broadly categorized into sequencebased, image-based, and graph-based methods  [5, 18] . Sequence-based methods  [2, 41, 42]  typically employ Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) or Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) to model inter-frame information in skeleton sequences. Image-based methods  [34, 18]  transform skeleton sequences into images and then leverage CNN to extract hierarchical emotional representations. However, both sequence-and image-based methods struggle to capture interactions between distant, non-adjacent joints due to the lack of spatial modeling or the limited receptive field of convolutional kernels. As skeleton structures naturally form graphs in non-Euclidean geometric spaces, the core idea of graph-based methods  [1, 5, 33, 53, 4, 29, 66, 57, 59, 67, 56]  is primarily to leverage GCN to model spatial topologies and TCN to capture temporal motion dynamics. For example, Chen and Sun  [4]  present STA-GCN, which adaptively aggregates implicit and explicit spatial features along with multi-scale joint motion information. Additionally, Zhai et al.  [57]  propose a dual-steam network BPM-GCN to extract emotion features from both posture and motion streams. However, existing studies fail to fully exploit the complementary information between different streams, leading to the loss of discriminative features.",

Several works  [60, 11, 46, 40, 39]  have leveraged transformers for skeleton-based action recognition to extract more comprehensive spatiotemporal features. For example, Zhou et al.  [64]  introduce Hyperformer, which integrates skeleton structure information into the Transformer so as to capture inherent high-order joint relationships. Similarly, Wu et al.  [51]  propose FreqMix-Former, which enhances spatiotemporal correlation extraction by integrating frequency features with spatial representations. Additionally, other works  [7, 13, 15, 65, 36]  have explored hybrid architectures that combine GCNs and Transformers for improved spatiotemporal feature extraction. Notably, Chi et al.  [7]  integrate NeuralODEs with Transformer to enable online action recognition.\n\nIn this paper, we propose CGTGait, the first framework to collaboratively integrate both GCNs and Transformers for extracting more discriminative features in skeletonbased gait emotion recognition.

As shown in Figure  2 , our proposed CGTGait consists of two streams: the posture stream and the motion stream. The posture stream directly takes the original sequence X as input and employs four stacked Collaborative Graph and Transformer (CGT) blocks to extract the human posture spatiotemporal feature f p ∈ R Cp×Tp×N (e.g., joint angles and distances). The motion stream first applies a motion extractor M(•) to generate the motion sequence X ∈ R C ′ in ×T×N (i.e., C ′ in = 8, including three velocity components, overall velocity, three acceleration components, and overall acceleration for each joint). Subsequently, another set of four stacked CGT blocks is employed to capture the high-order motion feature f m ∈ R Cm×Tm×N . Additionally, a Bidirectional Cross-Stream Fusion (BCSF) module is introduced after two CGT blocks to align posture and motion features, thereby facilitating the exchange of complementary information between the two streams. Finally, the test score is obtained by averaging the scores from both streams. Furthermore, the posture stream is enhanced with 31 affective features  [57]  (i.e., 14 angle features, 9 distance features, and 8 area features) to more effectively capture emotional cues from the gait sequence.

      "text": "Motivation. As discussed in Section 1, long-range dependencies between gait frames encode distinctive biological information, which is essential for accurate emotion recognition. However, existing methods primarily rely on TCN to capture local temporal details, neglecting longrange temporal dependencies. To address this limitation, we propose the Collaborative Graph and Transformer (CGT) block for comprehensive global spatiotemporal feature extraction.\n\nOperation. The details of the CGT block are illustrated in Figure  2(b) . By leveraging the interaction between GCN and Transformer, the CGT block effectively captures framelevel spatial topology and global temporal dependencies, thereby obtaining a more comprehensive and discriminative spatiotemporal representation. Specifically, our CGT block can be formulated as follows:\n\nwhere G(•) and T (•) denote graph modeling and transformer modeling, respectively, and Conv(•) represents the residual connection. Finally, we incorporate an FR Head  [62]  and a contrastive loss L CL to enhance the discriminative capability and robustness of the output feature f out by minimizing the distance between confident and ambiguous samples.\n\nGraph Modeling: Given an input feature f in ∈ R Ci×Ti×N , we first compute the self-attention adjacency matrix C k ∈ R N×N to establish global joint connections for each sequence, formulated as:\n\nwhere Conv θ (•) and Conv φ (•) denote two CNNs with a kernel size of 1 × 1. Softmax(•) and the symbol of ⊗ represent the softmax function and matrix multiplication, respectively. Subsequently, the output feature f outg ∈ R Co×Ti×N of graph modeling process is formulated as follows:\n\nHere, A k ∈ R N×N is a predefined adjacency matrix that represents the human physical structure based on prior knowledge, while B k ∈ R N×N is a learnable adjacency matrix, initialized as zero and updated in an end-to-end manner. K v denotes the number of graph subsets. Through graph modeling, we obtain frame-level global spatial topology information.\n\nTransformer Modeling: The transformer modeling is designed to capture global relationships among different frames, consisting of a multi-head self-attention (MHSA) mechanism, a feedforward network (FFN), and a temporal downsample CNN. Specifically, the feature f outg is first linearly transformed into the query Q ∈ R N×Ti×Ct , key K ∈ R N×Ti×Ct , and value V ∈ R N×Ti×Ct as follows:\n\nwhere W Q , W K , and W V ∈ R Co×Ct are learnable weight matrices. The MHSA mechanism then splits the Q, K, and V into h heads and performs self-attention in parallel across these heads. The output from all heads is subsequently concatenated and linearly projected to form the final output. Consequently, the complete transformer modeling is formulated as:\n\nHere, h is the number of heads in MHSA, and LN(•) denotes the LayerNorm function. Finally, we apply a pointwise CNN to map f trans . To reduce information redundancy and computational complexity, the stride of the pointwise convolution in the last two CGT blocks is set to 2 × 1.\n\nThrough transformer modeling, we extract global temporal dependencies.",

Motivated by the success of Transformers in multimodal learning  [38] , we present the Bidirectional Cross-Stream Fusion (BCSF) module to enhance information exchange between two streams, with a particular focus on context awareness across frames for more comprehensive emotion recognition.\n\nOperation. As shown in Figure  3 , the BCSF module comprises two temporal cross-transformers and two dynamic spatial attentions, effectively bridging spatiotemporal gaps and facilitating cross-stream information exchange. The BCSF process can be formulated as:\n\nwhere T SF p and T SF m denote the spatiotemporal fusion of the posture and motion streams, respectively. This design allows the network to attend to human posture while effectively capturing motion dynamics, thereby enhancing emotion recognition performance.\n\nGiven the symmetry of dual-stream fusion, we introduce the detailed structure using T SF p as an example.\n\nTemporal Fusion: Similar to Equation  4 , we first linearly project the two input features f pi and f mi ∈ R C ′ i ×T ′ i ×N into three matrices: the posture stream's query Q p , the motion stream's key K m , and the motion stream's value V m . A multi-head cross-attention (MHCA) is then applied to facilitate dual-stream feature learning and fusion, as follows:\n\nwhere C k is the channel number of K m . Next, a feedforward network (FFN) is employed to further integrate the extracted cross-stream features. To enhance learning while preserving the original stream features, residual connections are incorporated. This process can be formulated as follows:\n\nHere,\n\ni ×N is the output of temporal fusion. Similarly, applying Equation  7 and Equation 8 to the motion stream yields its temporal fusion feature\n\ni ×N . This temporal fusion strategy effectively aligns the temporal features of the posture and motion streams, enabling the extraction of complementary cross-stream features.\n\nSpatial Fusion: First, the feature f ct m undergoes global average pooling (GAP) along the channel and temporal dimensions to extract the spatial joint topology feature across the entire sequence. Then, a multilayer perceptron (MLP) with a sigmoid activation function is applied to generate the spatial joint attention SAttn m ∈ R N , which is formulated as:\n\nwhere σ(•) and P(•) denote the sigmoid function and GAP operation, respectively. The values in SAttn m represent the relative importance of joints in the motion stream. Finally, the weighted feature based on SAttn m and f ct m is added to f ct p to produce the final spatial fusion feature\n\ni ×N , which is formulated as:\n\nSimilarly, by applying Equation  9 and Equation  10 , we obtain the another output\n\ni ×N . This spatial fusion manner focuses on the key spatial joint information for emotion recognition, promoting the interaction between dual-stream spatial features.",

The baseline model is the same as in Section 4.4. Our findings reveal that: 1) Both CGT and BCSF contribute to performance improvements (+0.88% and +1.11% for CGT, and +2.75% and 2.21% for BCSF), demonstrating their effectiveness. 2) Compared to CGT, BCSF shows a more substantial improvement (+0.88% vs. +2.75%, and +1.11% vs. +2.21%), highlighting the greater significance of feature interaction between the two streams in enhancing emotion recognition performance. 3) The combination of CGT and BCSF provides a more comprehensive spatiotemporal feature representation, leading to the best overall performance and underscoring their complementarity.\n\nImpact of Spatiotemporal Modeling Strategy in CGT. In Table  4 , we examine the effect of different spatiotemporal modeling strategies in CGT on emotion recognition. The results demonstrate that the serial connection of GCN and Transformer, particularly in the GCN-Transformer configuration, outperforms the parallel strategy. Specifically, performance improves from 86.70% to 90.37% on Emotion-Gait and from 90.61% to 92.27% on ELMD. These findings suggest that the serial connection is more effective in capturing rich and discriminative features, resulting in better   emotion recognition performance.\n\nEffectiveness of Spatiotemporal Fusion in BCSF. As shown in Table  5 , we investigate the effectiveness of spatiotemporal fusion in BCSF. In this case, the baseline model is CGTGait without BCSF. We find that both spatial and temporal fusions generally improve recognition performance, and their combination yields the best results, highlighting their complementary nature. Additionally, temporal fusion proves more effective than spatial fusion (+3.67% vs. +0.92%, and +1.65% vs. +0.55%), which also verifies the importance of temporal modeling in gait emotion recognition tasks.\n\nImpact of BCSF Position. As shown in Table  6 , we evaluate the impact of BCSF at different positions. The results demonstrate that the best performance is achieved when BCSF is applied after the second CGT block. We analyze the reasons as follows: 1) In early stages, the ability to extract semantic information from the different streams is insufficient, meaning that premature interaction cannot effectively integrate more discriminative semantic information. 2) At a later stage, each stream may lose its distinct emotional information, leading to ineffective integration of meaningful information during subsequent interactions.  Impact of the Number of CGT Blocks. In Table  7 , we investigate the influences of the number of CGT Blocks. Our findings indicate that an excessive number of CGT blocks can lead to network overfitting and performance degradation. Consequently, we select a stack of four CGT blocks to achieve optimal performance.\n\nImpact of the Number of Heads h. The influence of the number of heads (h in Equation 5 and Equation  7 ) is listed in Table  8 . We find that gradually increasing h can effectively improve performance, indicating that more heads enrich the temporal modeling's capacity. However, an excessive number of heads can lead to performance degradation. We set h to 4 to achieve optimal performance.",
