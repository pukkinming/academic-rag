      "text": "Compared with the rich studies on the motor brain-computer interface (BCI), the recently emerging affective BCI presents distinct challenges since the brain functional connectivity networks involving emotion are not well investigated. Previous studies on emotion recognition based on electroencephalography (EEG) signals mainly rely on single-channel-based feature extraction methods. In this paper, we propose a novel emotion-relevant critical subnetwork selection algorithm and investigate three EEG functional connectivity network features: strength, clustering coefficient, and eigenvector centrality. The discrimination ability of the EEG connectivity features in emotion recognition is evaluated on three public emotion EEG datasets: SEED, SEED-V, and DEAP. The strength feature achieves the best classification performance and outperforms the state-of-the-art differential entropy feature based on single-channel analysis for the EEG signals. The experimental results reveal that distinct functional connectivity patterns are exhibited for the five emotions of disgust, fear, sadness, happiness, and neutrality. Furthermore, we construct a multimodal emotion recognition model by combining the functional connectivity features from EEG and the features from eye movements or physiological signals using deep canonical correlation analysis. The classification accuracies of multimodal emotion recognition are 95.08 ± 6.42% on the SEED dataset, 84.51 ± 5.11% on the SEED-V dataset, and 85.34 ± 2.90% and 86.61 ± 3.76% for arousal and valence on the DEAP dataset, respectively. The results demonstrate the complementary representation properties of the EEG functional connectivity network features with eye movement data. In addition, we find that the brain networks constructed with fewer channels, i.e., 18 channels, achieve comparable performance with that of the 62-channel network with respect to multimodal emotion recognition and enable easier setups for BCI systems in real scenarios.",

      "text": "E MOTION plays a crucial role in many aspects of our daily lives, such as social communication and decisionmaking. According to the Gartner hype cycle in 2019  [1] , emotion artificial intelligence (AI) is one of the 21 emerging technologies that will significantly impact our society over the next 5 to 10 years. Emotion AI, also known as artificial emotional intelligence or affective computing  [2] , aims at enabling machines to offer the capabilities to recognize, understand, and process emotions. Compared with the rich studies on the motor brain-computer interface (BCI), the recently emerging affective BCI (aBCI)  [3]  faces distinct challenges since the brain functional connectivity networks involving emotions are not well investigated  [4] . The aBCI technology aims to advance the human-computer interaction systems with the assistance of various devices to detect the affective states from neurophysiological signals. Therefore, the major challenge facing emotion AI and aBCI in the primary stage lies in emotion recognition  [5] .\n\nIn recent years, extensive endeavors have been devoted to emotion recognition. Among a variety of emotion recognition approaches, the modalities used to detect affective states primarily comprise two categories: the external behavioral signals, including facial expression  [6] , speech  [7] , body language, etc., and the internal physiological signals  [8] , containing electroencephalography (EEG)  [9] , electrocardiography (ECG)  [10] , respiration, galvanic skin response, etc. These two categories have their own prominent properties. The external behavioral signals outperform in terms of convenience of data collection, while the physiological signals are believed to be more objective and reliable in conveying emotions. As a result, multimodal emotion recognition has become the major trend, since it may leverage the complementary representation properties of different modalities. Nevertheless, most existing studies have focused on the fusion of visual and audio signals  [11]    [12] , while few studies have combined the behaviors with physiological signals  [13]    [14] .\n\nAmong the physiological modalities, EEG has exhibited outstanding performance in emotion recognition and is promising in elucidating the basic neural mechanisms First, the emotion experiment is designed to simultaneously collect the EEG and eye tracking data while the subjects are watching emotional movie clips. Second, the EEG-based functional connectivity networks are constructed and selected to obtain the emotion-relevant critical subnetworks. Finally, the EEG functional connectivity network features and eye movement features are extracted and later fused to train the affective model.\n\nunderlying emotion  [15]    [16] . Moreover, the fusion of EEG and eye tracking data has been shown efficient in multimodal emotion recognition, with increasing interests among research communities  [17] [18] . In this paper, we adopt the EEG signals, along with eye movement data or peripheral physiological signals, to classify different emotions.\n\nMost existing studies on EEG-based emotion recognition have relied on single-channel analysis  [15] ,  [16] ,  [17] ,  [18] , where EEG features are independently extracted within each EEG channel in different brain regions. In contrast, studies on cognitive science and neuroimaging have demonstrated that emotion is a complex behavioral and physiological reaction that involves circuits in multiple cerebral regions  [19] . In addition, studies in neuroscience and neuropsychiatry have revealed that patients with cognitive defect psychophysiological diseases such as autism, schizophrenia and major depressive disorder present decreased brain functional connectivity by both functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and EEG  [20] . Furthermore, studies on neuroimaging based on fMRI have indicated that brain functional connectivity may offer the potential of representing the fingerprints in profiling individuals  [21] , as well as the ability of individuals to sustain attention  [22] . These results have provided evidence for the connection between cognition and brain functional connectivity. However, few studies have explored the emotion associated brain functional connectivity patterns. The study of emotion recognition from the perspective of the brain functional connectivity network remains to be further investigated and may eventually lead to the understanding of the underlying neurological mechanisms behind how emotions are processed in the brain.\n\nIn this paper, we aim to investigate the emotion-relevant brain functional connectivity patterns and evaluate the per-formance of the EEG connectivity feature for multimodal emotion recognition with respect to three public datasets: SEED  [17] , SEED-V  [23] , and DEAP  [24] . The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. Section II introduces the related literature regrading multimodal emotion recognition and brain functional connectivity analysis. Section III describes the emotion experimental design. Section IV presents the proposed multimodal emotion recognition framework based on the brain functional connectivity. Section V analyzes and discusses the experimental results. Finally, a brief conclusion will be presented in Section VI.",

      "text": "Various modalities have been exploited to detect affective states in the past few decades. With the advent of computer vision and speech recognition, research on emotion recognition using facial expression and speech has gained prevalence  [6]    [7] .  Hasani and Mahoor [25]  proposed an enhanced neural network architecture that consists of a 3D version of the Inception-ResNet network followed by a long short-term memory (LSTM) unit for emotion recognition from facial expressions in videos. They employed four databases in classifying different emotions, including anger, fear, disgust, sadness, neutrality, contempt, happiness, and surprise. Trigeorgis et al.  [26]  presented an endto-end speech emotion recognition framework created by combining the convolutional neural network (CNN) and LSTM models. Schirmer and Adolphs  [27]  studied different modalities with respect to emotion perception, including facial expression, voice, and touch. The authors suggested that the mechanisms of these modalities have their own specializations and that together, they could lead to holistic emotion judgment.\n\nApart from the external behavioral modalities, the internal physiological signals have also attracted the attention of numerous researchers due to their objectivity and reliability. Zhang et al.  [28]  conducted respiration-based emotion recognition using the sparse autoencoder and logistic regression model. Nardelli et al.  [29]  performed valencearousal emotion recognition based on the heart rate variability derived from the ECG signals. Atkinson and Campos  [30]  improved the EEG-based emotion recognition by combining the mutual information-based feature selection methods with kernel classifiers. Liu et al.  [31]  constructed a real-time movie-induced emotion recognition system to continuously detect the discrete emotional states in the valencearousal dimension. Zheng et al.  [15]  systematically evaluated the performances of different feature extraction, feature smoothing, feature selection and classification models for EEG-based emotion recognition. Their results indicated that stable neural patterns do exist within and across sessions. Among these modalities, EEG has been proven to be promising for emotion recognition and demonstrates competence for revealing the neurological mechanisms behind emotion processing.\n\nIn EEG-based emotion recognition, numerous EEG features have been exploited to enhance the performance of aBCI systems. The conventional EEG features could be categorized into temporal domain, frequency domain, and time-frequency domain  [32] . In the temporal domain, the most commonly used EEG features mainly include the fractal dimension and higher order crossings  [33] . Due to the nonstationary essence of the EEG signals and the fact that raw EEG signals are usually contaminated with artifacts and noises, the frequency domain features such as power spectral density (PSD)  [34] , higher order spectra  [33] , and differential entropy (DE)  [35]  and the time-frequency domain features such as wavelet features  [32]  and Hilbert-Huang spectra  [33]    [36]  have demonstrated outstanding performance in the EEG-based emotion recognition systems. However, these conventional EEG feature extraction methods are based on single-channel analysis, which neglects the EEG-based functional connectivity networks in association with different emotions.",

      "text": "Brain connectivity has long been studied in the fields of neuroscience and neuroimaging to explore the essential nature of the cerebrum. According to the attributes of connections, brain connectivity could be classified into three modes: structural connectivity, functional connectivity, and effective connectivity  [37] . These modes separately correspond to the biophysical connections between neurons or neural elements, the statistical relations between anatomically unconnected cerebral regions, and the directional causal effects from one neural element to another.\n\nRecently, increasing evidence has indicated that a link does exist between brain functional connectivity and multiple psychophysiological diseases with cognitive deficiency. Murias et al.  [38]  found that robust patterns of EEG connectivity are apparent in autism spectrum disorders in the resting state. Yin et al.  [39]  concluded that the EEG-based functional connectivity in schizophrenia patients tends to be slower and less efficient. Ho et al.  [40]  indicated that adolescent depression typically relates to the inflexibly elevated default mode network connections based on fMRI. Whitton et al.  [41]  suggested that elevations in high frequency EEG-based functional connectivity may represent a neural pattern for the recurrent illness course of major depressive disorder. However, few studies have investigated the links between emotions and brain functional connectivity networks or conducted emotion recognition from the perspective of brain networks. Whether there truly exist specific connectivity patterns for different affective states remains to be lucubrated.\n\nIn the past years, only a few preliminary research efforts on EEG-based emotion recognition have attempted to employ the multichannel EEG analysis approaches. Dasdemir et al.  [42]  directly used the connectivity metric of phase locking value as the EEG feature in distinguishing the positive and negative emotions. Lee and Hsieh  [43]  tested three different connectivity metrics, correlation, coherence, and phase synchronization index, in classifying the positive, neutral, and negative emotions. Li et al.  [44]  also studied these three emotions by combining the functional connectivity with local action features. Moon et al.  [45]  utilized CNN to model the connectivity matrices constructed by three different connectivity metrics: correlation, phase locking value, and phase lag index. However, these studies either ignored the topology of the brain functional connectivity networks or failed to analyze the emotion-related functional connectivity signatures. In our previous study on EEGbased emotion recognition  [46] , we identified the brain functional connectivity patterns of the three emotions (sad, happy and neutral) and extracted the topological features from the brain networks to recognize these emotions. In this paper, we extend this preliminary work to the threeclass (sad, happy, and neutral), five-class (disgust, fear, sad, happy, and neutral), and valence-arousal dimension multimodal emotion recognition tasks.",

      "section_name": "Eye Movement Data",
      "text": "Studies in neuroscience and biological psychology have indicated the relation between emotion and eye movement data, especially pupil diameter and dilation response. Widmann et al.  [47]  indicated that emotional arousal by novel sounds is reflected in the pupil dilation response and the P3 event-related potentials. Oliva and Anikin  [48]  suggested that the pupil dilation response reveals the perception of emotion valence and confidence in the decision-making process. Moreover, Black et al.  [49]  showed that the eye tracking and EEG data in autism spectrum disorders are atypical during the processes of attention to and cognition of facial emotions.\n\nIn addition, eye movement data could be obtained through eye tracking glasses which are wearable, portable and noninvasive. Therefore, eye movement data, as a behavioral reaction to emotions, have been widely utilized to assist with EEG-based emotion recognition in aBCI systems. L ópez-Gil et al.  [18]  improved EEG-based emotion recognition by combining eye tracking and synchronized biometrics to detect the valence-arousal basic emotions and a complex emotion of empathy. Zheng et al.  [50]  evaluated the complementary characteristics of EEG and eye movement data in classifying positive, neutral and negative emotions by fusing the DE and pupil diameter features. Lu et al.  [17]  extended this preliminary work and systematically examined sixteen different eye movement features. Furthermore, their work has been extended to the five emotions by Li et al.  [23]  and Zhao et al.  [51] , and the discrimination ability and stability over time of EEG and eye tracking data were also revealed. However, these research approaches were all based on single-channel analysis for the EEG signals: whether there exist complementary representation properties of EEG connectivity features and eye movement data remains to be further analyzed.",

      "text": "As a complex psychological state, emotion is reflected in both physical behaviors and physiological activities  [52] [19] . The collection of external behavioral data is more convenient than that of internal physiological signals, since the procedure could be accomplished without involving any invasive devices. Despite the inconvenience of data collection, the physiological signals are believed to be more objective and reliable because the participants cannot forge their internal activities.\n\nWith different modalities exhibiting distinct properties, modern emotion recognition approaches have the tendency of combining multiple modalities to enhance the performance of aBCI systems. Perez-Gaspar et al.  [53]  extended the evolutionary computation of artificial neural networks and hidden Markov models in classifying four emotions (angry, sad, happy, and neutral) by combining the speech with facial expressions. Tzirakis et al.  [54]  also fused the auditory and visual modalities using an end-to-end valencearousal emotion recognition model. They applied the CNN and ResNet models to extract features from speech and visual signals, respectively, which were then concatenated and fed into the LSTM model to accomplish the end-toend training manner. Ranganathan et al.  [55]  conducted a 23-class discrete emotion recognition task based on four different deep belief networks by combining a variety of modalities, including face, gesture, voice and physiological signals.  Huang et al. [56]  studied the fusion of EEG and facial expression data using two decision-level fusion strategies, the sum and production rules, in detecting the four basic emotions (fear, sad, happy, and neutral).\n\nIn recent years, many researchers have suggested that the combination of EEG and eye tracking data is a promising approach for recognizing emotions in aBCI systems. L ópez-Gil et al.  [18]  combined EEG with eye tracking and biometric signals in a synchronized manner to classify emotions using multiple machine learning methods. Liu et al.  [57]  applied the bimodal deep autoencoder (BDAE) neural network in detecting the three basic emotions (positive, neutral, and negative) from EEG and eye movement data. Tang et al.  [58]  conducted the same task using bimodal deep denoising autoencoder and bimodal-LSTM models. Zheng et al.  [59]  presented EmotionMeter for detecting the four emotions (fear, sad, happy, and neutral). Qiu et al.  [60]  adopted the deep canonical correlation analysis (DCCA) model as a multimodal deep neural network for classifying the threeclass, four-class, and valence-arousal emotions. Their results suggested that DCCA outperforms BDAE and bimodal-LSTM models in multimodal emotion recognition. In this paper, we apply the DCCA model to address the multimodal emotion recognition task.",

Therefore, the movie clips were selected as the type of stimuli to better induce the subjects' affective states.\n\nDuring the preliminary experiment, a stimuli pool containing emotional movie clips corresponding with the five emotions was prepared and then assessed by 20 volunteers using rating scores ranging from 0 to 5. The higher scores represented the more successful elicitation of the subjects' emotions. Eventually, 9 movie clips for each of the five emotions were selected from the stimuli pool, all of which received a mean score of 3 or higher.

      "text": "The emotion experiments were conducted under the laboratory environment. During the emotion experiment, the subject was required to view the emotional movie clips and relaxed as much as possible to induce their emotions. Meanwhile, their EEG and eye movement signals were simultaneously collected by the 62-channel wet-electrode cap and the SMI eye tracking glasses, respectively. The EEG data were recorded with the ESI NeuroScan System at a sampling rate of 1000 Hz. The layout of the 62-channel EEG cap is based on the higher-resolution international 10-20 system. Fig.  2  presents these wearable devices and the layout of the 62-channel EEG cap. In this paper, there were 15 trials in total in each experiment, where each of the five emotions corresponds to 3 movie clips. Moreover, each subject was required to perform three sessions of the experiment on different days with an interval longer than three days. To better elicit the subjects' emotions, there was no repetition of movie clips within or across the three sessions. Thus, the aforementioned 9 movie clips for each emotion were randomly divided into three groups and later constructed the three sessions. As studies in cognitive science have indicated that emotion varies in a fluent and smooth manner, the order of play of these movie clips in one experiment was elaborately designed according to the following criteria: 1) avoiding sudden changes in emotion, such as clips of the emotion of disgust followed by clips of happiness; 2) utilizing movie clips of neutral emotion as a cushion between two opposite emotions.\n\nFig.  3  illustrates the protocol of the designed emotion experiment. During each trial of the experiment, the movie clip was guided by 15 seconds of a brief introduction about the content and the emotion to be elicited and ended with 15 or 30 seconds of self-assessment and relaxation for the subjects to mitigate their emotions. Particularly, the resting time was 30 seconds after disgust or fear emotions, and 15 seconds after the other three emotions. In general, the duration of one experiment was approximately 55 minutes.\n\nThis multimodal emotion dataset is named SEED-V  [23] , which is a subset of the public emotion EEG dataset SEED 1 . The SEED dataset  [17]  contains 62-channel EEG signals and eye movement data corresponding to three emotions (sad, happy, and neutral) from 9 subjects, with each subject performing the experiments three times. Thus, there are 27 experiments in total and each experiment contains 15 trials, with 5 movie clips for each of the three emotions.",

Then, we downsampled the EEG signals to 200 Hz to expedite the processing procedures. For further exploration of the frequency-specific brain functional connectivity patterns, the EEG data were filtered with the five bandpass filters corresponding to the five frequency bands (δ: 1-4 Hz, θ: 4-8 Hz, α: 8-14 Hz, β: 14-31 Hz, and γ: 31-50 Hz).\n\nFor the eye movement signals, the artifacts were eliminated using signals recorded from the EOG and FPZ channels. It has been proven that pupil diameter is subject to the ambient luminance in addition to the emotion stimuli materials  [62] . Fortunately, according to our observation and analysis, the pupil diameter exhibits consistency in response to the same emotional stimuli material across different subjects. Thus, principal component analysis was adopted to eliminate the luminance reflex of the pupil and to preserve the emotion-relevant components.",

Considering further fusion of our proposed EEG connectivity feature with eye movement data and comparison with the DE feature, we constructed the brain functional connectivity network using the same time window. The detailed procedure of brain network construction is depicted in Fig.  5 . First, the preprocessed EEG signals were segmented with a 4-second nonoverlapping time window. As a result, each sample is represented by a 4-second EEG segment of 62 channels. Since the five bandpass filters were employed during the preprocessing, each sample actually contains five 4-second EEG segments corresponding to the five frequency bands.\n\nSecond, the associations between pairs of EEG channels were computed using the connectivity metric (correlation or coherence) in each frequency band for each sample. Therefore, each brain network corresponds to a 62 × 62 symmetric connectivity matrix, where elements denote the association weights between pairs of EEG channels. Since the value of self-correlation is always equal to 1, elements on the main diagonal of connectivity matrices are usually set to zero and will not be used in later analysis  [37] .\n\nFinally, five brain connectivity networks were acquired for each sample, corresponding to the five frequency bands. For the brain networks constructed with 18 channels, there is no need to repeat the above procedures. We could directly select the corresponding elements in the 62×62 connectivity matrix to construct the 18 × 18 connectivity matrix.",

      "text": "Although the raw EEG signals were preprocessed to remove the noises, there still remain certain minor artifacts that may not be eliminated during the preprocessing phase. Unfortunately, these artifacts may further lead to the weak associations in the brain networks, which eventually results in obscureness in profiling the brain network topology. By convention, this problem is resolved by directly discarding these weak associations according to an absolute or a proportional threshold after sorting the association weights  [37]    [63] . However, this method fails to take the targeted task into consideration, thus offering no guarantee that the preserved stronger associations are truly task relevant. Therefore, we have proposed an emotion-relevant critical subnetwork selection approach to address this issue.\n\nThe goal is to explore the universal emotion-relevant brain functional connectivity patterns among different subjects. Therefore, we utilized samples in training sets of all subjects to select the emotion-relevant critical subnetworks. Nevertheless, it should be mentioned that the affective models trained in this paper are subject-dependent. For further analysis of the brain connectivity patterns in different frequency bands, we selected a total of five critical subnetworks corresponding to the five frequency bands. Assuming that L is the set of emotion labels, there are thus |L| categories of emotions. The emotion-relevant critical subnetwork selection approach for one specific frequency band is summarized into the following three phases: 1) Averaging phase: all brain networks in training sets are averaged over all samples and all subjects for each emotion: thus, |L| averaged brain networks corresponding to |L| emotions could be obtained. 2) Thresholding phase: for each averaged brain network, the same proportional threshold is applied to solely preserve the strongest associations. Thus, we attain critical edges for each emotion. 3) Merging phase: along with the original vertices, the critical edges in all |L| averaged brain networks are merged together to construct the emotion-relevant critical subnetwork.\n\nHere, the proportional threshold represents the proportion of the preserved connections relative to all connections in the brain network. Particularly, the threshold value was tuned as a hyperparameter of the affective models, ranging from [0.0, 1.0] with step size of 0.01. This procedure is also described in Algorithm 1. Suppose that the connectivity matrices X along with corresponding labels Y in the training sets for one frequency band are defined as:\n\nwhere M and N represent the number of samples and the number of vertices, respectively. Average matrices with the same emotion label c:\n\nx c = mean y i ==c (x i )\n\n3:\n\nSort the upper triangular elements of matrix x c based on the absolute value of the association weights:\n\nx * c = sort(abs(triu(x c )))\n\n4:\n\nDerive the critical edges corresponding to the strongest associations using threshold t:",

Precisely, if one edge belongs to the critical subnetwork, the corresponding association weight in the matrix will remain unmodified; otherwise, it will be set to zero, thus simulating the process of discarding this edge from the brain network. The critical connectivity matrices were subsequently fed into the Brain Connectivity Toolbox  [37]  to extract the three topological features: strength, clustering coefficient, and eigenvector centrality. Assume that the selected emotion-relevant brain functional connectivity network of one sample is regarded as an indirect graph G = (V, E * ), where V and E * represent the sets of vertices and critical edges, respectively. There are in total N vertices in the brain network. Suppose that the corresponding symmetric connectivity matrix of G is A = (a ij ), where i, j = 1, 2, ..., N , a ij denotes the association between two vertices v i and v j , and a ij = a ji . According to  [37] , we could provide rigorous definitions for the three EEG functional connectivity network features as below.\n\nThe strength feature F S is a basic measurement of the network topology, which could be written as:\n\nwhere s i+ and s i-represent the sum of the positive and negative associations connected to vertex v i , respectively, and are computed as:\n\nThe clustering coefficient feature F C is a measurement of the brain functional segregation that primarily quantifies the clusters within the brain network, which is defined as:\n\nwhere c i+ and c i-represent the clustering coefficient vector for the positive and negative associations of vertex v i , respectively. The clustering coefficient is equivalent to the fraction of triangles around a vertex and is calculated as:\n\nwhere k i denotes the total numbers of neighbors for vertex v i , and t k+ and t k-are the positive and negative weighted geometric means of triangles around v i , respectively. The triangles around a vertex are represented as:\n\nwhere\n\nThe eigenvector centrality feature F E evaluates the significance of an individual vertex in interacting with other vertices, facilitating integration, and thus serving a crucial role in network resilience. The eigenvector centrality score of vertex v i could be defined as:\n\nwhere M i is the neighborhood of v i . This equation could be easily transformed to the eigenvector equation using the vector notations: AF E = λF E . In general, the dimensions of the strength, clustering coefficient, and eigenvector centrality features in each frequency band are 2N + 2, 2N + 2, and N , respectively.",

The parameter updating is accomplished by using the negative value of correlation as the loss function. Thus, minimizing loss is equivalent to maximizing correlation.

This may be because the strength feature could intuitively reflect the emotion associated connectivity of the entire brain regions. In general, the strength and eigenvector centrality features exhibit higher accuracy with correlation as the connectivity metric, whereas the clustering coefficient feature exhibits better performance with coherence.\n\nThe features extracted from 18-channel-based brain networks exhibit considerable performance compared with those of 62-channel networks, which indicates that the EEG functional connectivity network features extracted from the brain networks constructed with fewer channels are promising for actual scenarios of emotion recognition applications in aBCI systems.\n\nIn our previous work  [46] , we have demonstrated that the EEG functional connectivity network features considerably outperform the PSD feature and that they are superior to those directly using the connectivity metrics as features. In this paper, the best classification accuracy of 74.05 ± 7.09% achieved by the strength feature defeats the value of 69.50±10.28% attained by the single-channel-based state-of-the-art DE feature in the work of  [51]  for the same dataset.\n\nTo further analyze the capability of the best feature, the strength, in recognizing each of the five emotions, the confusion matrices are displayed in Fig.  7 .

The emotionrelevant critical subnetworks are selected through three phases: averaging, thresholding, and merging. The numbers of subnetworks attained after each phase are 25, 25, and 5, respectively. Specifically, 25 corresponds to the five emotions in the five frequency bands, while 5 refers to the five frequency bands, since the critical connections of the five emotions in each frequency band are merged together during the third phase. In this paper, the 25 subnetworks attained after the thresholding phase are adopted to analyze the frequencyspecific brain functional connectivity patterns in association with the five emotions. To analyze both the positive and negative connections, we visualize the brain functional connectivity networks based on the connectivity metric of correlation.\n\nConsidering that the subnetworks are selected using samples from training sets of all participants and that a three-fold cross validation strategy is utilized, the emotionrelevant critical subnetworks are calculated three times. The results demonstrate that stable connectivity patterns are exhibited across these three calculations.\n\nFig.  11  presents the 25 critical subnetworks associated with the five emotions in the five frequency bands averaged over three folds. For better analysis of the distinct connectivity patterns for each emotion in each frequency band, we display all of the critical connections except for the intersections among the five emotions.\n\nIt could be observed that the positive correlation connectivity is much higher in the frontal lobes in the δ band for the negative affective states, including the emotions of disgust, fear, and sadness. In particular, for the disgust emotion, stronger positive connectivity is exhibited in the γ bands within both the left and right brain regions, and stronger negative connectivity is observed between the left and right brain regions. However, the fear emotion in the γ band is dominated by the stronger negative connectivity, and there are much weaker positive connections compared with those of the disgust emotion. In addition, much more positive connectivity in the θ band is exhibited for the fear emotion.\n\nThe fact that the functional connectivity patterns are quite similar for the sad and neutral emotions could account for the confusion between the sad and neutral emotions, which is consistent with previous findings  [23]    [34] . Nevertheless, the connectivity in the δ band tends to be positive within the frontal areas and negative in the left brain regions for the sadness emotion, while negative in larger brain areas for the neutral emotion.\n\nIn terms of the happiness emotion, the entire cerebral areas are much more active in the δ band with both positive and negative correlation connectivity. Moreover, in the θ band, negative connectivity is revealed between the frontal and parietal lobes, with positive connectivity between the frontal and temporal lobes. In the γ band, the functional connectivity patterns for the emotions of happiness, fear, and disgust are more similar, which may be originated from the fact that amygdala voxels contribute to these three emotions  [73] . Overall, these results are in accordance with findings in the literature based on fMRI that the brain regions contributing to the emotion classification are predominated in the frontal and parietal lobes  [73] .",
