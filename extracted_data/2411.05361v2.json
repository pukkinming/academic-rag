      "text": "Multimodal foundation models, such as Gemini and ChatGPT, have revolutionized human-machine interactions by seamlessly integrating various forms of data. Developing a universal spoken language model that comprehends a wide range of natural language instructions is critical for bridging communication gaps and facilitating more intuitive interactions. However, the absence of a comprehensive evaluation benchmark poses a significant challenge. We present Dynamic-SUPERB Phase-2, an open and evolving benchmark for the comprehensive evaluation of instruction-based universal speech models. Building upon the first generation, this second version incorporates 125 new tasks contributed collaboratively by the global research community, expanding the benchmark to a total of 180 tasks, making it the largest benchmark for speech and audio evaluation. While the first generation of Dynamic-SUPERB was limited to classification tasks, Dynamic-SUPERB Phase-2 broadens its evaluation capabilities by introducing a wide array of novel and diverse tasks, including regression and sequence generation, across speech, music, and environmental audio. Evaluation results show that no model performed well universally. SALMONN-13B excelled in English ASR and Qwen2-Audio-7B-Instruct showed high accuracy in emotion recognition, but current models still require further innovations to handle a broader range of tasks.

      "text": "Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) have accelerated the development of natural language processing (NLP)  (Touvron et al., 2023a; Achiam et al., 2023; Li et al., 2023b; Anthropic, 2023; Bai et al., 2023) . These models can follow natural language instructions, making users quickly adopt them for a variety of applications. They have been integrated into commercial products, such as ChatGPT  (Achiam et al., 2023)  and Claude  (Anthropic, 2023) , as well as in the open-source research community, including the LLaMA series  (Touvron et al., 2023a; b; Dubey et al., 2024 ). Yet, they are primarily text-based models, meaning they cannot process speech or audio, which are essential for more natural ways of communication and interaction with the real world.\n\nCompared to written text, spoken language has always been a more natural and convenient way for humans to communicate. Spoken language conveys a wealth of information, including semantics, prosody, emotion, and speaker characteristics, while text is limited to representing semantic information, which can sometimes even depend on the prosodic cues present in spoken language  (Lin et al., 2024) . This highlights the need for universal speech models and explains why automatic speech recognition (ASR) systems using text-based language models are not optimal. Several attempts have been made to develop instruction-based universal speech or audio models capable of performing various tasks, such as LTU-AS  (Gong et al., 2023) , SALMONN  (Tang et al., 2024a) , Qwen-Audio  (Chu et al., 2023; 2024) , and WavLLM  (Hu et al., 2024) . Despite significant research in universal speech models, evaluating them effectively and comprehensively remains a major challenge. In NLP, benchmarks for text LLMs include a large number of tasks. CrossFit  (Ye et al., 2021)  includes 160 tasks, BIG-bench  (Srivastava et al., 2022)  comprises 204 tasks, and Natural-Instructions  (Mishra et al., 2022; Wang et al., 2022)  provides 1,616 tasks. For universal speech models, several benchmarks have been proposed but with a fixed and limited set of tasks (typically around a dozen) to evaluate specific capabilities of models  (Yang et al., 2021; Dunbar et al., 2022; Maimon et al., 2024) . This is insufficient for evaluating a universal model, as we aim to investigate whether models can handle a broader range of tasks beyond fixed benchmarks. There is a strong demand for a benchmark that can evaluate these models across various aspects with a wide range of speech tasks, which led to the creation of Dynamic-SUPERB  (Huang et al., 2024a) .\n\nDynamic-SUPERB is the first benchmark for evaluating universal instruction-based speech and audio models. As models advance, we dynamically expand the benchmark by adding new tasks to provide better guidance for researchers in model development. We have designed a well-structured pipeline that harnesses the collective efforts of the community to gather diverse challenging, novel, and creative tasks. The first generation of Dynamic-SUPERB consists of 55 tasks, covering various aspects of speech (e.g., semantics, speakers, etc.), making it the speech benchmark with the most tasks. However, this is not sufficient to pave the way for developing universal speech models, especially given the complexity and richness of the information conveyed by spoken language. This paper presents the Dynamic-SUPERB Phase-2. We expanded it to 180 tasks, more than double the size of its first iteration, with contributions from the global research community. They cover a broad range of types, and some tasks present novel challenges that have not been explored in any previous research. Besides, previous speech research has typically treated music and environmental audio as background noise to be ignored. However, these sounds contain rich information and share overlapping elements that complement each other. Thus, in Dynamic-SUPERB, we also introduced preliminary music and audio tasks from established music and audio benchmarks  (Yuan et al., 2023; Turian et al., 2022) . We define the core tasks by reformulating the SUPERB  (Yang et al., 2021)  (speech), MARBLE  (Yuan et al., 2023) (music) , and HEAR  (Turian et al., 2022)  (audio) benchmarks for quick-round research experiments. One challenge of evaluating with such a large-scale benchmark is deriving concrete and useful insights from hundreds of evaluation results. We provide a taxonomy for every task in Dynamic-SUPERB, where tasks are clustered by the specific model capabilities they probe. Researchers can follow this taxonomy to develop or reinforce specific capabilities of the models they build. To our knowledge, Dynamic-SUPERB is the largest benchmark and the first to provide such a detailed task taxonomy in speech processing.\n\nWe conducted a comprehensive evaluation of several models using Dynamic-SUPERB Phase-2. To handle the diverse output formats of these models, we propose an automated LLM-based pipeline for general evaluation across tasks. The evaluation results show that these models perform well only on a limited range of tasks. For example, SALMONN-13B performed well on English ASR, while Qwen2-Audio-7B-Instruct achieved high accuracy in emotion recognition. However, they do not generalize well to a much broader range of tasks in speech recognition and paralinguistics. Notably, training on diverse data, even with significant differences in signal-level characteristics, can enhance performance across domains. We observed that spoken language models outperformed music models in certain music tasks. This highlights the potential for developing unified models for speech, music, and general audio. We have open-sourced all materials to support reproducibility and further research. We invite researchers to help expand Dynamic-SUPERB, making it more diverse and comprehensive to advance universal spoken language models.",

      "text": "LLMs have shown strong natural language processing abilities and are used in speech, audio, and music applications. Recent frameworks integrate a pre-trained speech encoder with an LLM through fine-tuning techniques such as LoRA  (Hu et al., 2021) . LTU-AS  (Gong et al., 2023)  combines Whisper  (Radford et al., 2023)  with LLaMA  (Touvron et al., 2023a) , and it is fine-tuned on openended speech and audio question-answering. SALMONN adopts a window-level Q-former  (Li et al., 2023a)  to generate soft prompts fusing representations from the speech and audio encoders. Qwen-Audio  (Chu et al., 2023)  introduces task-specific tags into Qwen to encourage knowledge sharing and prevent interference across diverse tasks, and it supports multi-turn dialogues for both audio and text inputs. WavLLM  (Hu et al., 2024)  uses curriculum learning to prevent overfitting on specific tasks while maintaining the LLM's original capabilities. All these models accept speech, audio, and text as input but output only text, focusing on understanding rather than generation in speech and audio. Several attempts have also used prompts for speech, music, and audio generation  (Guo et al., 2023; Agostinelli et al., 2023; Liu et al., 2023a) . However, to our knowledge, there is no universal model capable of handling both generation and understanding tasks. Moreover, these models have not been comprehensively evaluated on a benchmark, which hinders fair comparisons between them.",

      "text": "Several benchmarks have been developed to evaluate speech models. SUPERB  (Yang et al., 2021)  is the most widely used benchmark for assessing the performance of speech foundation models across various tasks that cover different aspects of speech. On the other hand, SLUE  (Shon et al., 2022; 2023)  focuses more specifically on spoken language understanding. Yet, they are primarily limited to English. LeBenchmark  (Evain et al., 2021; Parcollet et al., 2023)  evaluates speech foundation models specifically for French, while IndicSUPERB  (Javed et al., 2023)  is dedicated to Indian languages. ML-SUPERB  (Shi et al., 2023; 2024b)  offers ASR and language identification tasks in 100+ languages. Aside from speech, MARBLE  (Yuan et al., 2023)  and HEAR  (Turian et al., 2022)  offer platforms for evaluating various music and a wide range of audio tasks. Using these benchmarks, researchers build a specialized model for each task. Thus, the number of tasks is limited due to the growing costs associated with adding more tasks. Conversely, universal models are expected to do various tasks without fine-tuning for each one, allowing users to engage in far more diverse applications and enabling benchmark developers to include more tasks for comprehensive evaluation. In NLP and CV, benchmarks have been developed to evaluate models across a much broader range of tasks  (Bitton et al., 2023; Srivastava et al., 2022; Mishra et al., 2022) . However, in speech, we lack a benchmark of comparable scale. Dynamic-SUPERB  (Huang et al., 2024a)  is the first benchmark for instruction-based universal speech models. While its first version includes far more tasks than all other speech benchmarks, they are all classification tasks. AIR-bench  (Yang et al., 2024b) , on the other hand, includes tasks from speech, music, and audio, and expands beyond classification, although the number of tasks available for evaluating universal models remains limited (19 tasks in foundation track). Thus, there remains a critical need for a comprehensive benchmark that evaluates universal models across a broader range of tasks to fully assess their capabilities. Consequently, we developed Dynamic-SUPERB Phase-2, substantially upgrading the first generation with a detailed taxonomy and establishing community contribution protocols to facilitate continual task integration. (3) The model follows natural language instructions to execute the corresponding tasks. To comprehensively evaluate these universal models, we have collected hundreds of tasks and developed a task taxonomy to better guide benchmark users (Figure  1a ). All tasks in Dynamic-SUPERB Phase-2 are intended solely for testing purposes; we do not provide training data for two main reasons. First, current models are trained on large-scale, open-source, or proprietary datasets, making it challenging to ensure that all models are trained under consistent conditions. Second, we aim to evaluate universal models that do not require fine-tuning for downstream tasks.\n\nThe Dynamic-SUPERB project is designed to evolve dynamically with research advancements by incorporating novel tasks from the research community (Figure  1b ). With the first call for tasks, Dynamic-SUPERB Phase-2 has grown from its first generation, expanding from 55 to 180 tasks. Table  1  compares several benchmarks used in speech, music, and audio research, demonstrating that Dynamic-SUPERB Phase-2 is the largest benchmark covering all three areas. It provides a more fine-grained evaluation than any other benchmark.",

      "section_name": "Task Formulation",
      "text": "As Figure  1c  depicts, in Dynamic-SUPERB Phase-2, each task is structured to include: (1) Text instruction: A natural language instruction that guides the model on the task to perform. Each task has multiple different instructions to evaluate the model's ability to understand instructions.\n\n(2) Audio component: At least one audio element, which can be in the input, the output, or both.\n\n(3) (Optional) Text component: Text elements (other than instruction) that may serve as inputs or outputs. The number of audio elements in the inputs or outputs may vary depending on the task. For example, in speaker verification, two utterances are used to determine whether they were produced by the same speaker (green blocks in Figure  1c ). Besides, text inputs are not always required; for instance, ASR does not involve any text inputs. We use text format for instructions instead of spoken format. Spoken instructions involve varying content, speaker characteristics, and prosody, making them more complex. Text instructions act as an intermediary, bridging text and spoken universal models. These designs ensure consistency and simplify the model's understanding and processing of diverse tasks while maintaining the benchmark's extendibility with minimal constraints.\n\nAnother problem in evaluating universal models is the format of classification and regression tasks. Generally, a task-specialized model generates predicted labels (soft distributions or hard labels) within a pre-defined set of labels for classification or numeric values for regression within a predefined range. However, a universal model does not necessarily have access to this information, and thus it is hard to evaluate them in the same way, especially using it to perform several different tasks.\n\nTo address this, we believe that a universal speech model should produce outputs in natural language for all tasks (model outputs in Figure  1c ). Therefore, in Dynamic-SUPERB, all classification labels are represented as text. For regression tasks with specific formats (e.g., scalars, JSON, or Pythonstyle lists), we can parse the natural language outputs using a post-processing pipeline (Section 4.2).",

      "text": "Dynamic-SUPERB fosters community collaboration, encouraging the addition of innovative tasks to remain relevant in this rapidly changing field. In Phase-2, we initiated a call for tasks in March 2024 to invite contributions from the research community. We established an organized and transparent submission process on our GitHub portal, where we organize members who serve as editors to guide contributors. Contributors propose tasks by providing relevant information on GitHub. Each proposal is assigned to an editor who checks for major issues and prevents duplicated efforts. Then, task proposers upload their data to our Huggingface space in specified formats, using only datasets with proper licenses. They complete submissions by opening a pull request on GitHub with the necessary files. Afterward, editors review submissions on a rolling basis, offering suggestions for refinement rather than immediate acceptance or rejection. After iterative improvements, accepted tasks are merged into the repository. Between March and July 2024, we received more than 140 task proposals and accepted over 120 new tasks. Tasks still under review are not included here but will be featured in the next phase. For details, please refer to Appendix F.  One primary challenge in building a large-scale benchmark is offering valuable insights to its users.\n\nTo address this, we developed a task taxonomy 1  that helps researchers interpret performance results across various tasks. Researchers can leverage this taxonomy to select specific tasks for model development instead of evaluating every task in the benchmark.\n\nFigures 2 shows the high-level task taxonomy in Dynamic-SUPERB Phase-2. Due to the space limitation, we only show some representative tasks. Each leaf node includes at least one task and may be further categorized into more fine-grained sub-domains, which are not shown here due to space constraints. For example, within 'Speaker & Language/Speaker', we have two categories: 'Speaker Characteristics' and 'Speaker Identification', each containing several tasks. Please refer to Appendix B for the complete task list. We first categorize tasks into two primary fields: (I) speech and (II) music & audio, which are generally distinguished by the source of the sound. For instance, speech is produced by human vocal cords, music is created using instruments, and audio includes sounds generated by other creatures, materials, or natural phenomena. We then split each field into several domains based on the key attributes and challenges that the tasks within them present.",

Speaker and Language addresses the analysis of speaker characteristics and languages, covering tasks such as speaker verification, diarization, and language identification. Spoken Language Understanding deals with understanding and analysis of the content and semantics of spoken language. It covers tasks like sentiment analysis and speech translation. Phonetics, Phonology, and Prosody focuses on the sound structure of speech, including phoneme recognition, pronunciation evaluation, and prosodic features like stress and accent classification. Paralinguistics explores non-verbal aspects of speech, such as emotion recognition and vocal event detection, which can capture nuances like screaming or coughing. Speech Enhancement aims to improve speech quality by detecting and mitigating noise, reverberation, and other degradations, but currently, we only have understanding tasks. Speech, Voice, and Hearing Disorders is dedicated to identifying and classifying disorders such as stuttering and so on.

To address this, alongside the task taxonomy, we have selected core tasks for speech, music, and audio. These core tasks are reduced subsets of essential tasks that have been widely used or studied within the research community. We include tasks from three popular benchmarks: SUPERB (speech), MARBLE (music), and HEAR (audio). The three benchmarks were originally designed for evaluating encoders, not for an instruction-following universal model, so modifications are required. We crafted instructions for each task, reduced the data size, and reformulated them into the Dynamic-SUPERB format. Besides, we replaced the datasets in some tasks to address licensing issues. Since the core task set is much smaller than the full benchmark, researchers can more efficiently evaluate their models across a reasonable range of domains.",

SALMONN is further categorized into 7B and 13B versions based on the size of its LLM component. All of these models are publicly available, and we utilized their official implementations for inference without any modifications. The first five models are instruction-based speech models, each also trained with audio understanding capabilities. However, as they were not trained on music data, we do not expect them to perform well on music-related tasks. Hence, we further included MU-LLaMA and GAMA. MU-LLaMA is specifically designed for various music-understanding tasks, and GAMA is trained with both general audio data and a music corpus. Similar to the speech models, MU-LLaMA and GAMA adopt an LLM-based framework. They use a music or audio encoder, such as MERT  (LI et al., 2024)  or Q-former, to convert music or audio into features, which the LLM then uses as prompts for subsequent reasoning. The sampling strategies used for generating outputs from the LLMs were retained as defined in their official implementations. Finally, we implemented a cascaded system baseline called Whisper-LLaMA.\n\nThe system first transcribes audio using Whisper-v3-large, and then LLaMA3.1-8B processes the transcriptions to perform various tasks based on the provided instructions.\n\nWhen evaluating models on these diverse tasks, several challenges inevitably arise. One challenge was testing the baseline models on tasks involving multiple audio inputs. For example, in speaker verification, a model determines whether two utterances are produced by the same speaker. Among the evaluated models, only Qwen-Audio and Qwen2-Audio provide interfaces that allow inputting multiple audio files. For the remaining models, we concatenated all audio files, separated by 0.5 seconds of silence, and used the concatenated file as input.\n\nLast, different models have their own maximum supported audio durations. Models using Whisper to encode speech face an inherent limitation: Whisper can process audio files of up to 30 seconds, and some models are restricted to handling even shorter durations. Consequently, we retained the original model settings and did not modify the model architecture to accommodate longer audio clips. A preliminary analysis of all audio (Appendix G) in Dynamic-SUPERB Phase-2 shows that only a small proportion (around 6.57%) exceeds 30 seconds in length. Hence, we believe our settings do not largely impact the evaluation results and ensure reasonable inference efficiency.",

      "section_name": "Evaluation Metrics",
      "text": "The outputs of universal speech models are natural language sentences, making it difficult to assess their correctness using conventional metrics. For classification tasks, such as emotion recognition, a task-specific model outputs a label from predefined emotions in the dataset, while a universal model generates sentences like \"The speaker sounds happy.\" In this case, we can easily assess the correctness of the former by comparing labels, but this approach does not apply to the latter. Similarly, in regression tasks, a natural language response like \"Using MOS scoring criteria, I give the audio a score of 3 out of 5\" makes it difficult to directly use metrics such as mean square error.\n\nIn evaluation, we categorize tasks into three types: (1) classification, (2) regression, and (3) sequence generation. For each type, we use different pipelines to evaluate the models' outputs. For classification tasks, we utilize external LLMs (GPT-4o) as referees, with the temperature set to be zero for evaluation consistency, to evaluate whether the outputs from speech or music models 2  match the ground truth. This approach has been widely adopted in the NLP community  (Wang et al., 2023; Liu et al., 2023b; Chiang & Lee, 2023) , and we extend its application to speech research. We design a prompt that includes the task instructions, the model's output to be evaluated, and the corresponding ground truth. The LLM judge gets this prompt and determines if the output aligns with the ground truth using a chain-of-thought reasoning process. By leveraging the strong instruction-following capabilities of these LLMs, we constrain them to provide the final decision in a fixed format, allowing us to extract the answer using simple methods such as regular expressions 3  . We then define accuracy as the percentage of outputs that the LLM judge considers aligned with the ground truth. Please refer to Appendix E for details on the prompts and the alignment between LLMs and humans. Importantly, although we used GPT-4o for evaluation in the main text, to support reproducibility we have also included comprehensive evaluation results using the open-source LLM (LLaMA3.1-8b-Instruct) in Appendix C.\n\nFor regression tasks, the above method cannot be applied because performance is not assessed using hard labels. Instead, we use LLMs (GPT-4o) as a post-processor to transform natural language responses into a format compatible with the original metrics used in these tasks. Specifically, we developed a prompt that directs the LLMs to extract essential information from the output and convert it into the same format as the ground truth. If the output lacks correct or relevant information that can be converted to match the ground truth format, the LLM returns \"N/A\" to mark it as invalid. Since conventional metrics cannot accommodate \"N/A\" and setting a default value is unreasonable due to the variability of metrics, we also calculate the N/A rate for each regression task, defined as the percentage of invalid outputs within a task. A higher N/A rate indicates that the model struggles with following instructions, which may indirectly affect its performance on the task.\n\nFor sequence generation tasks such as ASR and captioning, we apply their original metrics directly to the raw outputs from baseline models. This is because identifying redundant prefixes or sections unrelated to the task objectives is highly challenging in sequence generation, even with human involvement. Besides, our review of the original evaluation results reported by these baseline models revealed no explicit mention of post-processing procedures. Therefore, we base our evaluations solely on the unprocessed outputs, ensuring consistency and objectivity across all models.",

Since different metrics are used across tasks, we adopted a relative-score-based method to summarize task performance.\n\nFor each task, we calculated the relative improvement of each model compared to the cascaded system baseline (Whisper + LLaMA) and then obtained the domain-level scores by averaging all its improvements across the tasks within each domain. For regression tasks, we introduced the N/A rate to measure how well a model meets the task requirements. The original task metric was only computed on instances that followed the task format (after post-processing by the LLM). To account for whether a model can follow instructions, we incorporated the N/A rate into the reported scores. Accordingly, we calculated the improvement based on scaled values. For metrics where a higher value indicates better performance (such as the F1 score), we multiplied the metric value by (1 -N/A rate). Conversely, for metrics where a lower value indicates better performance (such as word error rate), we divided the metric value by (1 -N/A rate).\n\nFigure  3  presents a domain-level comparison of relative scores across different models. Whisper-LLaMA consistently has zero scores throughout all domains, serving as the reference baseline for evaluating other models. In speech domains, no model outperforms Whisper-LLaMA in speech recognition and spoken language understanding. This shows that using ASR remains a strong baseline for language understanding, as text more explicitly represents semantic information than speech. However, Whisper-LLaMA lags behind SALMONN in phoneme recognition, a task for which SALMONN is explicitly trained, indicating that task-specific training still provides superior performance in specialized domains.\n\nConversely, in the speaker and paralinguistics domains, all models surpass the baseline. This improvement occurs because the ASR process in the cascaded system tends to discard critical information from the speech signal, such as speaker characteristics, pitch, and emotion. In contrast, other models utilize soft representations that retain more speech information, giving them the potential to learn beyond ASR, and some of these models were also trained to perform specific tasks within certain domains 4  . Additionally, music-specific large language models like GAMA-IT and Mu-LLaMA perform poorly on speech recognition and understanding tasks, which is expected since they were primarily designed for music understanding. Nevertheless, they surprisingly achieved scores comparable to the speech models in speaker and paralinguistics.\n\nTurning to audio and music domains, where ASR models cannot transcribe non-speech information into text, most models outperform the baseline in several areas, such as music classification and sound event detection. Surprisingly, spoken language models primarily trained on speech data (Qwen models, SALMONN, WavLLM) 5  outperform the two music models (GAMA-IT and Mu-LLaMA) in various music-related domains such as harmony and pitch, music classification, and rhythm analysis. We speculate that training on diverse data, even with significant differences in signal-level characteristics, enhances performance across domains, emphasizing the importance of developing unified models for speech, music, and general audio processing.\n\nLastly, we observe some outliers with significantly higher or lower values in the figure, typically resulting from unbounded evaluation metrics. For instance, in the phonetics and prosody domain, WavLLM and LTU-AS exhibit poor scores due to their erroneous outputs in phone/phoneme seg- ment counting tasks, predicting thousands of segments in utterances lasting only seconds and resulting in an excessively high mean square error. While the relative score-based approach effectively summarizes model performance, domain-level scores can be distorted by specific tasks within a domain. Thus, we encourage researchers aiming to develop model performance in specific domains to comprehensively report task-level scores to more accurately reflect their models' capabilities.",

      "text": "We tested the performance of the models on core tasks that are widely studied and commonly used. Table  2  presents the detailed results of the models on SUPERB tasks, displaying each task's performance in its own metric rather than relative scores. Please refer to Appendix D for results on HEAR and MARBLE. It is worth noting that these tasks have been adapted to the Dynamic-SUPERB framework. Therefore, the results are not directly comparable to previous studies that tested on the original SUPERB. However, they indicate current performance levels on these tasks.\n\nNo single model excels across all tasks. In phoneme recognition (PR), the SALMONN models were the only ones to achieve a relatively lower phoneme error rate (PER) compared to the others. For keyword spotting (KS), Qwen-Audio-Chat was the only model to perform slightly better than a random guess (50%). Whisper-LLaMA surpassed all other models in intent classification (IC).\n\nRegarding emotion recognition (ER), Qwen-Audio-Chat and Qwen2-Audio-7B-Instruct stood out, with the latter even achieving about 75% accuracy. In ASR, SALMONN-13B and WavLLM are the only two models that achieved a word error rate (WER) lower than 10%. Query-by-example (QbE) appears to be very challenging for all models, as none performed better than a random guess (50%). Slot-filling (SF) is evaluated using two metrics: F1 for slot type and CER for slot value. While Whisper-LLaMA and SALMONN-7B are the top two in this task, their results are still far from ideal. In speaker verification (SV), all models performed badly, as even the best ones achieved results close to random guessing (50%). In speaker diarization (SD), results were similarly poor, with some even reaching a 100% N/A rate. Comparing Figure  3  and Table  2 , we observed that performance on core tasks sometimes deviates from trends observed at the domain level. For example, although SALMONN-13B outperforms other models in ASR, it lags behind Whisper-LLaMA in the speech recognition domain, revealing its limited capabilities and highlighting the need to enhance its generalizability. In summary, among tested models, some excel in specific tasks, while others perform poorly across the board, and none dominate across all tasks. We believe these findings provide valuable insights for researchers aiming to improve models, starting from core tasks and progressively tackling each domain in the benchmark for broader applicability.",

      "text": "This paper presents Dynamic-SUPERB Phase-2, the largest benchmark for evaluating instructionbased universal spoken language models, building upon collaborative efforts across the research community. Dynamic-SUPERB covers a wide range of diverse tasks and offers a fine-grained task taxonomy. The recent models show good performance on specific tasks but poor generalization across common tasks like those in SUPERB, highlighting the need for further research on universal models. All materials are made openly available to facilitate reproduction and benchmarking. We sincerely invite researchers to join our vibrant community and collaborate to advance the field.\n\nLimitations: Although Dynamic-SUPERB Phase-2 is the largest and most comprehensive benchmark, we acknowledge its limitations. It lacks comprehensive speech-generation tasks, as Phase-2 focused on understanding tasks due to the few universal generation models. Despite our efforts to develop the task taxonomy scientifically, new domains may emerge as the benchmark grows, and tasks can be categorized in various ways. While our automatic evaluation pipeline using LLMs correlates well with human evaluations (Appendix E) for current tasks, it may not generalize to all future tasks. Upholding the core spirit of the Dynamic-SUPERB project, we are striving to address these issues and enhance the benchmark for the next phase.",

Additionally, we asked all contributors to provide the necessary license information to ensure that we can include them in the benchmark properly. More specifically, all task data in Dynamic-SUPERB are derived from datasets with licenses that permit remixing and redistribution. As we expect the benchmark to grow dynamically in the future, we maintain a complete list of dataset licenses on our official GitHub page (https://github.com/dynamic-superb/dynamic-superb/blob/ main/docs/dataset_license.md), which will be updated as new tasks are introduced.
