      "text": "Multimodal learning is an approach to building models that can process and integrate information from multiple heterogeneous data modalities  [2, 20, 21] , including image, text, audio, video, and table. Since numerous tasks in the real world involve multiple modalities, multimodal learning has become increasingly important and attracted widespread attention as an effective way to accomplish these tasks. In recent years, the field of Emotion Recognition in Conversations (ERC) has witnessed a surge in effective models  [8, 27, 30] . Moving beyond unimodal recognition, the utilization of multimodal data offers a multidimensional perspective for more nuanced emotion discernment  [9, 19, 24] . Consequently, the incorporation of multimodal data is a natural evolution for enhancing emotion recognition in conversations. However, the widespread adoption of multimodal learning has revealed underlying challenges, with a primary focus on modality imbalances. These imbalances entail disparities in the contributions of individual modalities to the final decisionmaking process.\n\nAs illustrated in Figure . 1, the text modality quickly addresses the overall model performance and the joint logit scores, whereas the visual and audio modalities remain under-optimized throughout the training process. In addressing modality imbalance, diverse terminologies have emerged to characterize this phenomenon and explore its underlying causes. Terms such as \"greedy nature\"  [39] , \"modality collapse\"  [15] , and \"modality imbalance\"  [6, 22]  have been employed in various studies. These terms are associated with factors such as the \"suppression of dominant modalities\"  [26] , \"different convergence rates\"  [36] , \"diminishing modal marginal utility\"  [37] , or \"modality competition\"  [14] . In essence, two primary perspectives emerge regarding this problem  [37] : firstly, modalities exhibit varying levels of dominance, with models often overly reliant on a dominant modality with the highest convergence speed, thereby impeding the full utilization of other modalities with slower convergence speeds. Secondly, modal encoder optimization varies, necessitating the adoption of multiple strategies. Some approaches  [7, 26]  attempt to modulate the learning rates of different modalities based on the fusion modality. However, these approaches often overlook the impact of intra-modal data enhancement  [46] . For instance, right from the initial representations through the modal encoder, the outputs can lead to misleading final results, resulting in its weakened position across all modalities. Hence, from the outset, it is crucial to enhance representations for each modality, regardless of whether they are weak or strong, as it can affect the imbalance in learning across modalities.\n\nMoreover, current methodologies primarily focus on interactions between pairs of modalities  [6, 22, 26, 40] , resulting in complex computations and inadequate treatment across all modalities. These methods are commonly applied in tasks such as audio-visual learning  [26, 40]  and multimodal affective computing  [46] , often using datasets related to sarcasm detection, sentiment analysis, or humor detection. However, there is a lack of methods explicitly tailored for multimodal ERC tasks, especially for well-known multimodal datasets like IEMOCAP  [3] , MELD  [28] , and CMU-MOSEI  [1] . Additionally, in recent prominent studies  [17, 33] , while overall performance for multimodal ERC tasks has notably increased, a closer examination of the \"importance of modality\" reveals that pairwise modalities consistently fail to achieve satisfactory performance, creating a significant gap compared to leveraging all three modalities simultaneously. Therefore, it is crucial to simultaneously leverage learning from all modalities while also significantly enhancing the capabilities of weaker modalities to improve the overall learning performance of multimodal ERC models in practical applications.\n\nIn this paper, we propose a novel framework named Ada2I that addresses imbalances in learning across audio, text, and visual modalities for multimodal ERC. It consists of two primary modules including Adaptive Feature Weighting (AFW) and Adaptive Modality Weighting (AMW) for feature-level and modality-level balancing respectively in the consideration of Inter-and Intra-modal interactions. Focusing on feature-level balancing using Adaptive Feature Weighting (AFW), we apply tensor contraction to infer feature-aware attention weights for each modality, which aims to produce a feature-level balanced representation for each conversation. As an important component of AFW, Attention Mapping Network controls the balancing via maximizing the alignment between unimodal features and their corresponding attention coefficients. For modality-level balancing using Adaptive Modality Weighting (AMW), we further exploit feature-level balanced representations from the preceding AFW module to generate modality-level balanced ones through modality-wise normalization of features and learning weights before being used to enhance the emotion recognition. Additionally, we utilize the concept of disparity ratio, although with modifications compared to the study by Peng et al.  [26] , called OGM-GE, as a value to supervise the training process and evaluate the model. Specifically, while OGM-GE  [26]  introduced gradient modulation for pairs of modalities, we refine it to handle all three modalities simultaneously-textual, visual, and audio-in the Multimodal emotion recognition in conversation task. This adjustment reduces model complexity and overall processing time, leading to enhanced efficiency. To summarize, our contributions are as follows:\n\n• We propose an end-to-end framework named Ada2I that addresses the issue of imbalance learning across modalities comprehensively for the multimodal ERC task. It not only considers modality-level imbalances but also leverages feature-level representations to contribute to the balancing step in the learning process.

      "text": "Multimodal Emotion Recognition (ERC) has emerged as a focal point within the affective computing community, garnering significant attention in recent years. The integration of multimodal data provides a multidimensional perspective, enabling a more nuanced understanding of emotions. Moreover, researchers have increasingly turned to multimodal fusion techniques, combining text, audio, and visual cues to enhance multimodal ERC performance  [9, 10, 16, 18, 24, 25] . ICON  [9]  employs two Gated Recurrent Units (GRUs) to capture speaker information, supplemented by global GRUs to track changes in emotional states throughout conversations. Similarly, MMGCN  [38]  utilizes Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs) to capture contextual information, effectively leveraging multimodal dependencies and speaker information. On the other hand, Multilogue-Net  [31]  introduces a solution utilizing a context-aware RNN and employing pairwise attention as a fusion mechanism. TBJE  [4] , adopts a transformer-based architecture with modular co-attention to jointly encode multiple modalities. Additionally, COGMEN  [16]  is a multimodal context-based graph neural network that integrates both local (speaker information) and global (contextual information) aspects of conversation. Moreover, CORECT  [24]  employs relational temporal Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) with cross-modality interaction support, effectively capturing conversation-level interactions and utterance-level temporal relations. GraphMFT  [18]  utilizes multiple enhanced graph attention networks to capture intra-modal contextual information and intermodal complementary information. More recently, DF-ERC  [17]  emphasizes both feature disentanglement and fusion while taking into account both multimodalities and conversational contexts. Moreover, AdaIGN  [33]  employs the Gumbel Softmax trick to adaptively select nodes and edges, enhancing intra-and cross-modal interactions. While these methods primarily focus on designing model structures, they overlook the challenges posed by modality imbalance during multimodal learning.",

      "text": "Despite the suggestion by  [13]  that integrating multiple modalities could enhance the accuracy of latent space estimations, thereby improving the efficacy of multimodal models, our investigation within the multimodal ERC task reveals a phenomenon contradicting this notion. The problem of modality imbalance persists as a significant challenge in multimodal learning frameworks involving low-quality data  [43] , particularly in tasks such as multimodal ERC. Conventional methods often prioritize one modality over others, assuming that certain types of sensory data are more relevant for a given task. For example, textual cues may receive greater emphasis, while visual or audio cues alone might be prioritized  [16, 24, 38] . Current methodologies for addressing imbalanced multimodal learning primarily focus on tasks such as audio-visual learning with a focus on optimizing pairwise modality learning  [6, 26, 40] , sentiment analysis, and sarcasm detection  [46] . However, these approaches often have task-specific limitations and framework restrictions, limiting their broader applicability. For instance, Wang et al.  [36]  identified that different modalities overfit and generalize at different rates, leading to suboptimal solutions when jointly trained using a unified optimization strategy. Peng et al.  [26]  proposed OGM-ME method where the better-performing modality dominates the gradient update, suppressing the learning process of other modalities. MMCosine  [40]  employs normalization techniques on features and weights to promote balanced and improved fine-grained learning across multiple modalities. Notably, there is a lack of specific approaches tailored for multimodal ERC apart from the work by Wang et al.  [37] . Recently, Wang et al.  [37]  observed a phenomenon referred to as \"diminishing modal marginal utility\" and proposed finegrained adaptive gradient modulation, which was applied to ERC, while I 2 MCL considers both data difficulty and modality balance for multimodal learning based on curriculum learning for affective computing, though not specifically for emotion recognition. To comprehensively address the challenge of modality imbalance in multimodal ERC, we propose an end-to-end model that ensures balance among text, audio, and visual modalities during training.",

Similar to  [40] , we observe the imbalance problem in multimodal ERC through experiments analyzing the modality-wise weight in norm of each label during training. Apparently, the dominant unimodal encoder, e.g., text, tends to have its weight in norm increase much faster than the weaker modalities, i.e., audio and visual, leading to divergent unimodal logit scores and distorting the joint fusion representation. Inspired by  [35, 45] , we propose to incorporate modality-wise L2 normalization to properly weight features, mitigating imbalances arising from differing data distributions and noise levels across modalities.

Most notably, with the weaker modality pair (audio+visual) consistently lagging behind in performance compared to the full modality combination (i.e., with AdaIGN, this gap is 23.12%), Ada2I boosts the model and shortens the gap to only 5.22%. Similarly, with the text+audio (T+A) and text+visual (T+V) pairs, this gap is also substantially reduced, indicating that the model has learned in a more balanced manner, leveraging additional useful information from non-dominant modalities.
