      "text": "This paper presents the Coordinate Heart System (CHS), a geometric framework for emotion representation in artificial intelligence applications. We position eight core emotions as coordinates on a unit circle, enabling mathematical computation of complex emotional states through coordinate mixing and vector operations. Our initial five-emotion model revealed significant coverage gaps in the emotion space, leading to the development of an eight-emotion system that provides complete geometric coverage with mathematical guarantees. The framework converts natural language input to emotion coordinates and supports real-time emotion interpolation through computational algorithms. The system introduces a re-calibrated stability parameter S ∈ [0, 1], which dynamically integrates emotional load, conflict resolution, and contextual drain factors. This stability model leverages advanced Large Language Model (LLM) interpretation of textual cues and incorporates hybrid temporal tracking mechanisms to provide nuanced assessment of psychological well-being states. Our key contributions include: (i) mathematical proof demonstrating why five emotions are insufficient for complete geometric coverage, (ii) an eight-coordinate system that eliminates representational blind spots, (iii) novel algorithms for emotion mixing, conflict resolution, and distance calculation in emotion space, and (iv) a comprehensive computational framework for AI emotion recognition with enhanced multi-dimensional stability modeling. Experimental validation through case studies demonstrates the system's capability to handle emotionally conflicted states, contextual distress factors, and complex psychological scenarios that traditional categorical emotion models cannot adequately represent. This work establishes a new mathematical foundation for emotion modeling in artificial intelligence systems, with applications in human-computer interaction, mental health monitoring, and affective computing. The mathematical framework has been fully implemented in software (Section 9) to facilitate reproducibility and practical adoption.",

      "text": "Emotion recognition and modeling represent fundamental challenges in artificial intelligence, with applications that span human-computer interaction, mental health monitoring, and affective computing systems. Traditional approaches to emotion representation rely primarily on categorical models that classify emotions into discrete states, or dimensional models that position emotions along continuous axes such as valence and arousal  [9] . Although these frameworks have proven useful, they often lack the mathematical precision required for computational systems to accurately model the complex, continuous nature of human emotional experience.\n\nThe limitations of existing approaches become particularly apparent when attempting to represent mixed or complex emotional states. Current categorical systems struggle to capture emotions that exist between traditional categories, while dimensional models, though continuous, often fail to provide intuitive geometric relationships that correspond to human emotional experience. This gap between theoretical emotion models and practical computational requirements has motivated the development of new mathematical frameworks for emotion representation.\n\nThis paper introduces the Coordinate Heart System (CHS), a novel geometric approach to emotion modeling that addresses these limitations through a mathematically grounded coordinate-based framework. Beyond core emotions, CHS uniquely integrates a **recalibrated Stability parameter, now operating on a [0, 1] scale**, allowing for a comprehensive representation of psychological well-being influenced by both emotional load and non-emotional contextual factors. The system positions core emotions as fixed points on a unit circle, enabling complex emotional states to emerge through vector mathematics and coordinate interpolation, while its refined stability model ensures a nuanced and realistic understanding of a user's state. Our approach provides both the precision required for computational applications and the geometric intuition that aligns with human emotional experience.\n\nThe development of CHS revealed a critical insight: Initial attempts using five core emotions resulted in significant coverage gaps within the emotion space, creating \"blind spots\" where certain emotional states could not be accurately represented. Through systematic analysis, we identified that eight strategically placed emotions provide complete geometric coverage of the emotional space, eliminating these representation gaps.\n\nThe primary contributions of this work include: (1) a mathematical proof demonstrating why five-emotion coordinate systems are insufficient for complete emotional space coverage, (2) the design and validation of an eight-emotion coordinate system that eliminates coverage gaps, (3) algorithms for emotion mixing, interpolation, and distance calculation within the coordinate framework, and (4) a **robust computational architecture suitable for real-time AI emotion recognition applications, featuring an enhanced stability model that dynamically incorporates contextual influences.** Details on the software implementation and code availability are provided in Section 9.",

      "section_name": "Original 5-Emotion Model",
      "text": "The initial iteration of the Coordinate Heart System emerged from 16 days of intensive selfmapping during psychological exploration, leading to an empirically derived foundation for emotional representation. This preliminary model identified five core emotions-love, guilt, joy, pride, and anger-as fixed coordinate points arranged in a circular pattern around the cardiac center.\n\nThe original framework categorized emotions into two distinct types: Dot Emotions, representing stable, localizable emotional states that maintained consistent spatial positions, and Wave Emotions, The concept of \"Wave Emotions\" (which included aspects like lust, and previously other dynamic states) was actually explored in an earlier, five-core emotion model that the paper mentions as a predecessor. However, the paper's research ultimately found that this \"Wave Emotions\" concept, as formulated in that older model, wasn't accurate or valid for effectively representing emotions in computer systems.\n\nBecause of this, the current paper you provided focuses on the eight-core emotion system, which offers a more robust and computationally viable geometric framework for emotion representation. The newer system moves beyond those initial \"Wave Emotion\" ideas, concentrating instead on the fixed coordinates and mixing principles we discussed earlier, which are better suited for AI applications.\n\nA critical validation component involved Collapse Logs, documenting how the geometric structure responded under extreme psychological stress. While emotional intensity caused coordinate distortion, the underlying circular architecture remained intact, confirming system resilience under overload conditions. This initial model utilized a sixth parameter for neutral state representation, combined with intensity scaling for each core emotion. The framework underwent validation through cross-AI peer review systems and somatic testing protocols, establishing its foundational principles before subsequent model refinement.\n\nThe five-emotion system provided the conceptual framework and empirical methodology that enabled expansion to the current eight-emotion model, demonstrating the scalability of the geometric approach to emotional representation.",

The model consistently failed to represent three fundamental emotional states: sadness, fear, and disgust. Basic expressions such as \"I am sad today\" proved impossible to map within the existing coordinate space.\n\nThe initial framework was constrained by the assumption that five symmetrically-positioned emotions would provide complete coverage. This led to the hypothesis that sadness, fear, and disgust could emerge as combinations of the existing coordinates (love, guilt, joy, pride, anger). However, empirical validation demonstrated that linear combinations of these five emotions could not produce authentic representations corresponding to the observed somatic locations of sadness, fear, and disgust.\n\nAdditional representational failures included tiredness, shock, and illness-related emotional states. The geometric constraint of five equally-spaced coordinates created systematic coverage gaps in the two-dimensional emotional space that could not be resolved through existing interpolation methods.\n\nThe introduction of the stability scale and the addition of sadness, fear, and disgust as independent coordinates resolved these coverage limitations, necessitating expansion to the eight-emotion system for complete geometric representation.",

Previously impossible expressions such as \"I am sad today\" now map directly to coordinate (0.866, -0.5), while complex emotional states receive accurate geometric representation through coordinate interpolation.\n\nStability-Enhanced Representation: The enhanced stability framework enables representation of ambiguous emotional states through the three-component drain system:\n\nExpressions such as \"I'm not okay, but I don't know why,\" \"I'm tired,\" and \"I'm sick\" can now be accurately modeled through X drain (contextual factors) without requiring spe-cific emotion activation, capturing the psychological reality that distress can manifest without identifiable emotional content.\n\nComplex Emotion Processing: The eight-coordinate framework supports sophisticated emotional mixing. For example, \"I saw a cockroach today and felt sad for killing it\" generates accurate representation through coordinate interpolation between disgust (-0.5, -0.866) and sadness (0.866, -0.5), weighted by respective emotional intensities.\n\nCultural and Linguistic Universality: The coordinate-based approach transcends cultural emotion labeling differences. When the system processes coordinates [0.2, -0.3], it interprets this as \"slightly angry, moderately sad, and moderately guilty\" regardless of linguistic or cultural emotion terminology, ensuring consistent AI emotion recognition across diverse contexts through geometric relationships rather than semantic labels.",

      "text": "The eight-emotion coordinate system provides mathematically complete coverage of the emotional space through the combination of radial and angular geometric properties. We establish formal proof of coverage completeness through convex hull analysis and interpolation theory. Theorem: The eight-emotion coordinate system can represent any emotional state within the unit disk D = (x, y) : x 2 + y 2 ≤ 1. Proof: Let L = (0, 0) represent love at the origin, and let E i = (cos θ i , sin θ i ) for i = 1, 2, . . . , 7 represent the seven emotions positioned on the unit circle, where θ i are the respective angular positions. For any target point P = (x, y) within the unit disk, we demonstrate that P can be expressed as a convex combination of the eight base emotions. Case 1: Radial Coverage For any point P on the line segment connecting L to any boundary emotion E i , we have: P = (1 -t)L + tE i = t(cos θ i , sin θ i ) where t ∈ [0, 1] represents the interpolation parameter. This provides complete radial coverage from the origin to any point on the unit circle. Case 2: Angular Coverage The seven emotions positioned around the unit circle create a heptagonal convex hull that approximates the unit circle. For any angular direction ϕ, there exist adjacent emotions E j and E j+1 such that θ j ≤ ϕ ≤ θ j+1 . Any point in the angular sector between E j and E j+1 can be expressed as: P = αL + βE j + γE j+1 where α + β + γ = 1 and α, β, γ ≥ 0. Case 3: Complete Interior Coverage For any point P within the unit disk, we can express P using barycentric coordinates with respect to the convex hull formed by L and the seven boundary emotions. Since L is at the center and the seven emotions span the boundary, their convex hull covers the entire unit disk. The mathematical completeness follows from the fact that:\n\n1. The origin L = (0, 0) serves as a universal interpolation anchor 2. The seven boundary emotions provide sufficient angular resolution around the unit circle 3.
