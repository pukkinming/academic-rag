In this paper, we introduce a Pose-Guided Semantics-Aware CLIP-based architecture, or CLIP for Micro-Gesture recognition (CLIP-MG), a modified CLIP model tailored for micro-gesture classification on the iMiGUE dataset. CLIP-MG integrates human pose (skeleton) information into the CLIP-based recognition pipeline through pose-guided semantic query generation and a gated multi-modal fusion mechanism. The proposed model achieves a Top-1 accuracy of 61.82%.

      "text": "Micro-gestures (MGs) are subtle, spontaneous body movements that can reveal hidden emotional states  [1, 2] , often occurring when people attempt to suppress their true feelings. Unlike overt actions or expressive gestures, micro-gestures involve minute motions (e.g., slight fidgeting, brief facial or limb movements) that are short in duration and low in amplitude, making them hard to detect and classify  [3] . The analysis of micro-gestures has gained traction in affective computing and human behavior understanding because these involuntary cues provide valuable insight into a person's internal state. Automatic recognition of micro-gestures is therefore important for applications in psychology, human-computer interaction, and emotion analysis  [4, 5] .\n\nIn this paper, we present CLIP-MG, a novel multi-modal framework for micro-gesture classification on iMiGUE. Our approach builds upon previous work by incorporating pose (skeleton) data in a principled way. The main contributions are summarized as follows:\n\n1. We develop a system that uses human pose cues to help guide the semantic query extraction from video frames. The skeleton information helps focus the CLIP visual encoder on the regions of subtle motion. This creates a semantic query embedding that is rich with features relevant to pose. 2. We introduce a gated fusion mechanism to combine visual and skeleton representations effectively.\n\nOur gated fusion learns to weight and integrate the two modalities. This allows pose features to adaptively modulate the visual features before and during the cross-attention process. 3. We extend CLIP to a multi-modal setting. The pose-based query is fed into the CLIP transformer for cross-attention over semantically significant visual token features. This limits the model to attend to parts relevant to gesture. This results in a fused representation that has both semantic and motion-specific information for classification.\n\n4. We evaluate CLIP-MG on the iMiGUE micro-gesture dataset. We additionally perform numerous ablation studies to quantify how much each proposed component improves performance. The results of our ablation studies provide insights for future researchers and future research directions.",

In particular, iMiGUE is a large-scale video dataset introduced by Liu et al.  [6]  for identity-free micro-gesture understanding and emotion analysis. The iMiGUE dataset consists of video footage of tennis players during post-match interviews, with detailed frame-level annotations of various micro-gestures. The dataset contains 72 subjects (split into 37 for training and 35 for testing in a cross-subject protocol) and a total of 33 gesture classes.\n\nOne thing to note is that the class distribution is highly imbalanced. 28 of the 33 classes are tail classes with relatively few samples, meaning they collectively only make up less than 60% of the data. This long-tailed distribution, combined with the subtlety and high intra-class variability of micro-gestures, makes the recognition task extremely challenging  [7] .",

CLIP (Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training)  [12]  has shown powerful visual feature representations aligned with semantics via natural language supervision. However, straightforward fine-tuning of CLIP on video data can neglect smaller semantic information. To address this, Quan et al. proposed Semantic-Constrained CLIP (SC-CLIP)  [13] . SC-CLIP adapts CLIP to video by generating a compact semantic query from dense visual tokens and using cross-attention to refocus the model on those action-relevant semantics. This \"constrains\" CLIP's attention to discriminative features and yields stronger zero-shot and fine-grained recognition. SC-CLIP demonstrates that directing attention to semantically meaningful regions can improve fine-grained video understanding. Micro-gestures, despite being low in their extent of movement, still take place with subtle visual semantics. Skeleton key-points give precise spatial-temporal anchors (hands, face, shoulders) that show where and when these cues take place. Thus, we design a pose-guided semantic attention mechanism that uses skeletal cues to steer CLIP towards where the gesture is taking place. This creates a query that captures the subtle semantics of micro-gestures.",

Let 𝑧 𝑡,𝑝 be the set of patch embeddings from all selected frames (excluding the global tokens). We first identify a subset of these visual tokens that are relevant to the micro-gesture. \"Pose guidance\" is applied by using the skeleton features to weight or select visual tokens:\n\n• We compute an attention mask over image patches based on the distance of each patch to the nearest skeletal joint position. If a patch lies close to a joint that is moving significantly, it receives a higher weight.

This adaptability is important because pose data can sometimes be noisy or incomplete (e.g., occluded joints), so a static fusion might hurt performance if pose is trusted blindly.

It acts as a form of feature selection: among the many visual features of a scene (some possibly irrelevant background or person identity cues), it emphasizes those that correlate with the action semantics.

Removing pose guidance lowers accuracy from 61.82% to 51.23% (-10.59 pp), showing that skeletal information is very important for localizing subtle joint motions, as they act as an attention prior  [27]  that focuses the visual stream towards the regions where micro-gestures occur. Eliminating cross-attention drops accuracy to 53.17% (-8.65 pp), which indicates that without a mechanism to selectively pool pose-weighted tokens, the model may struggle to tell apart very similar gestures. Finally, disabling gated fusion yields 60.08% (-1.74 pp), which indicates that adaptively balancing pose and visual information slightly improves the robustness of the architecture.\n\nTaken together, these results show how the different components effectively complement each other.

By guiding CLIP's visual attention with skeleton-based spatial priors, generating compact semantic queries, and fusing pose and appearance via a learnable gate, CLIP-MG extracts subtle, discriminative features that simple RGB or pose-only models cannot recognize. Our model achieves 61.82% Top-1 accuracy, outperforming most single-modality baselines and performing on par with strong 3D-CNN and vision-transformer approaches. Extensive ablation studies confirm that each component provides a measurable benefit. The experiments provide insights into how each component interacts with and complements others, which highlights important design patterns that can inform future model development in micro-gesture classification and similar fine-grained recognition tasks. Our findings demonstrate the value of integrating multimodal and semantic information to address challenging visual recognition problems.\n\nOur future work will explore richer temporal approaches and data strategies to close the gap between CLIP-MG and more recent state-of-the-art models  [9] . First, integrating sequence models (temporal transformers or recurrent layers over cross-attention outputs) should capture patterns that static sampling loses. Second, video motion magnification  [28]  could amplify imperceptible movements. This would help with pose tracking and visual encoding. Third, joint pre-training on related actiongesture datasets and weakly-or self-supervised learning could improve feature robustness  [29] . Finally, regarding accuracy, we plan to incorporate uncertainty-aware gating for noisy skeletons and classbalanced or prototype-based calibrations to address long-tail imbalance  [30] . To improve and better evaluate the explainability of the model, we will incorporate gradient-weighted class activation mapping (Grad-CAM)  [31]  and more recent attention-aware token-filtering approaches  [32] . Currently, the proposed architecture suffers heavily due to its relatively low speed on commodity hardware. To address this issue, we plan to experiment with several multimodal compression and optimization algorithms for more efficient computing  [33, 34, 35, 36] . We plan to train an improved version of our architecture for downstream tasks on the DAIC-WoZ dataset  [5, 37, 38]  for low-level mental health analysis. These different research directions are promising in pushing pose-guided CLIP models closer to (and beyond) human-level understanding of the subtlest gestures.",
