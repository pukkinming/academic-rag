      "text": "With the extensive accumulation of conversational data on the Internet, emotion recognition in conversations (ERC) has received increasing attention. Previous efforts of this task mainly focus on leveraging contextual and speaker-specific features, or integrating heterogeneous external commonsense knowledge. Among them, some heavily rely on future contexts, which, however, are not always available in real-life scenarios. This fact inspires us to generate pseudo future contexts to improve ERC. Specifically, for an utterance, we generate its future context with pre-trained language models, potentially containing extra beneficial knowledge in a conversational form homogeneous with the historical ones. These characteristics make pseudo future contexts easily fused with historical contexts and historical speaker-specific contexts, yielding a conceptually simple framework systematically integrating multicontexts. Experimental results on four ERC datasets demonstrate our method's superiority. Further in-depth analyses reveal that pseudo future contexts can rival real ones to some extent, especially in relatively context-independent conversations.",

Original utterances are in dark-colored blocks and generated pseudo future contexts are in light-colored blocks.\n\nmethods  [16, 11]  and graph-based methods  [6, 19] . To further enrich conversational information, another line of research proposes to enhance representations of utterances with knowledge augmentation. These methods are mainly devoted to introducing external commonsense knowledge to facilitate comprehension of utterances, and have amply proved their effectiveness  [4, 28] . Though many sophisticated designs have been proposed to exploit context information, we found some of them heavily rely on future contexts  [6] . The problem is that we may face the unavailability of future contexts. For example, imaging a scenario of detecting the emotion of an utterance just-in-time in an after-sale conversation, we will have no future contexts available. This fact motivates us to simulate unseen future states by generating pseudo future contexts. As shown in Figure  1 , for each utterance, we can use a pre-trained language model (e.g., DialoGPT  [26] ) to generate its future context, introducing consistent yet extra beneficial knowledge for emotion recognition. Compared with heterogeneous external knowledge used in previous works (e.g., commonsense knowledge), the knowledge extracted is represented in a conversational form homogeneous with historical contexts, and hence can be easily integrated.\n\nWe further design a novel context representation mechanism that can be applied indiscriminately to multi-contexts, including historical contexts, historical speaker-specific contexts, and pseudo future contexts. Specifically, for each type of contexts, we employ relative position embeddings to capture the positional relationship between an utterance and its surroundings, obtaining a refined representation of an utterance, as well as a local conversational state. We then utilize GRUs to model how the local state evolves as the conversation progresses, characterizing long-term utterance dependencies from a global view. A final representation, which fuses multi-contexts information from both local and global perspectives, is fed into a classifier to produce the emotion label of an utterance.\n\nWe conduct extensive experiments on four ERC datasets, and the empirical results verify the effectiveness and potential of our method.\n\nIn summary, our contributions are:  (1)  We propose improving ERC from a novel perspective of generating pseudo future contexts for utterances, incorporating utterance-consistent yet potentially diversified knowledge from pre-trained language models. (2) We design a simple yet effective ERC framework to integrate pseudo future contexts with historical ones and historical speaker-specific ones, yielding competitive results on four widely-used ERC datasets.  (3)  We analyze how pseudo future contexts correlate with characteristics of emotionconsistency and context-dependency among utterances in conversations, revealing that pseudo future contexts resemble real ones in some scenarios.",

      "text": "Works on ERC can be roughly categorized into sequence-based methods and graph-based methods.\n\n(1) Sequence-Based Methods. Sequence-based methods treat each utterance as a discrete sequence with RNNs  [3]  or Transformers  [21] .  [16]  and  [7]  utilized RNNs to track context and speaker states.  [10]  used two levels of Transformers to capture contextual information and seize speaker information with an auxiliary task.  [22]  treated ERC as an utterance-level sequence tagging task with a conditional random field layer.  [11]  utilized BART with supervised contrastive learning and an auxiliary response generation task.\n\n(2) Graph-Based Methods. Treating an utterance as a node, contextual and speaker relations as edges, ERC can be modelled using graph neural networks.  [6]  modelled both the context-and speaker-sensitive dependencies with graph convolutional networks. To reflect the relational structure,  [8]  proposed relational position encodings in graph attention networks. Considering the temporal property,  [19]  proposed to encode with a directed acyclic graph.\n\n(3) ERC with External Knowledge. Some works propose to introduce heterogeneous commonsense knowledge for ERC.  [27]  combined word and concept embeddings with two knowledge sources. Taking advantage of COMET, a Transformer-based generative model  [1]  for generating commonsense descriptions,  [4, 28, 9]  enhanced the representations of utterances with commonsense knowledge. It is noteworthy that our method distinguishes itself by not relying on the design of intricate instructions or prompts to extract knowledge from the pre-trained language models, setting it apart from other methods that utilize generative models as knowledge bases  [23, 14] .",

Unlike modeling the distances between utterances with sinusoidal position embeddings in previous sequence-based methods  [27, 10] , we utilize relative position embeddings and further compare with three position embeddings in Table  4b : without position embeddings; sinusoidal position embeddings that use sine and cosine functions of different frequencies; position embeddings learned from scratch. It is clear that the distance information exploited by relative position embeddings at utterance-level is more compatible with a sequence-based method and therefore achieves better results.\n\nEffect of Size of Local Areas. In our experiments, we set the size of local areas to 6 (i.e., using five historical utterances at most). We further investigate the size effect of local areas by employing ERCMC in C&S setting. From the results in Figure  3 , we can draw a general trend that performances show an upward tendency when starting using historical utterances and decrease when using all historical contexts due to information redundancy.

      "text": "In Section 5.1, we have mentioned that both pseudo and real future contexts improve the performance of ERCMC, and compared with the C&S&RF setting, the C&S&PF setting performs better on EmoryNLP and MELD and worse on IEMOCAP and DailyDialog. This section provides a more in-depth analysis of how pseudo and real future contexts affect the final results. We first categorize the four datasets concerning several previous observations. Firstly, in Table  3 , C&S setting obtains relative improvements over RAW setting of 15.92% on IEMOCAP, 4.16% on DailyDialog, 2.46% on EmoryNLP and 1.80% on MELD. Secondly, in Table  4a , compared with the full C&S&PF setting, when the original local-aware embeddings are removed, the performances drops by 4.83% on IEMOCAP, 1.27% on DailyDialog, 48.96% on EmoryNLP and 21.53% on MELD. Thirdly, in Figure  3 , the curves of EmoryNLP and MELD are stabler than those of IEMOCAP and DailyDialog.\n\nFrom them, we can conclude that conversations in IEMOCAP and DailyDialog are more context-dependent, while conversations in EmoryNLP and MELD are relatively context-independent. An alternative explanation for this conclusion is that IEMOCAP and DailyDialog are two-party datasets, and therefore the conversations are more emotion-focused, whereas EmoryNLP and MELD are multi-party datasets, resulting in more diffuse conversations and inconsistent emotions.\n\nTo further explore the effect of using pseudo or real future contexts, we attempt to investigate the attributes of future contexts. Previous works  [5, 24]  have reported a common issue with ERC: different emotions in consecutive utterances may confound a model and thereby degrade performance. Inspired by the issue, we define a new concept of \"emotion-consistency\" as the degree of emotional consistency of the subsequent utterances with the first utterance within a local area. Given a local area LC = (u 0 , • • • , u ℓ ), the emotion-consistency is:\n\nwhere W T = (wt 0 , • • • , wt ℓ-1 ) is the weight in different positions, ϕ(u i , u 0 ) is a function to indicate whether u i and u 0 having the same emotion.\n\nFor quantitative analysis, we employ ERCMC in C setting to predict emotions and calculate the emotion-consistency scores. To align with pseudo future contexts, we simplify the test sets to ensure each utterance has at least ℓ consecutive utterances (ℓ = 5 in our experiments). Two kinds of weight are considered, wt 1 i = 1 ℓ , wt 1 i ∈ W T 1 ; wt 2 i = exp e ℓ-i ℓ j=1 exp e j-1\n\n, wt 2 i ∈ W T 2 . W T 1 relies uniformly on consecutive utterances, while W T 2 favours utterances near the first utterance.\n\nFrom Table  5a , 5b, 5c and 5d, we can observe that: (1) Emotion-consistency scores of IEMOCAP and DailyDialog are higher than those of EmoryNLP and MELD. The finding confirms our previous observations that IEMOCAP and DailyDialog are more context-dependent, whereas EmoryNLP and MELD are somewhat context-independent. (2) Performance and emotion-consistency scores are positively correlated. And combined with Table  2 , using pseudo future contexts achieves competitive results on IEMOCAP and DailyDialog, and outperforms using real future contexts on EmoryNLP and MELD. The results demonstrate that pseudo future contexts can replace real ones to some extent when the dataset is context-dependent, and serve as more extra beneficial knowledge when the dataset is relatively context-independent.",
