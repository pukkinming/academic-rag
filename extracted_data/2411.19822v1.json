      "text": "Multimodal Emotion Recognition in Conversations (MERC) aims to classify utterance emotions using textual, auditory, and visual modal features. Most existing MERC methods assume each utterance has complete modalities, overlooking the common issue of incomplete modalities in real-world scenarios. Recently, graph neural networks (GNNs) have achieved notable results in Incomplete Multimodal Emotion Recognition in Conversations (IMERC). However, traditional GNNs focus on binary relationships between nodes, limiting their ability to capture more complex, higher-order information. Moreover, repeated message passing can cause over-smoothing, reducing their capacity to preserve essential high-frequency details. To address these issues, we propose a Spectral Domain Reconstruction Graph Neural Network (SDR-GNN) for incomplete multimodal learning in conversational emotion recognition. SDR-GNN constructs an utterance semantic interaction graph using a sliding window based on both speaker and context relationships to model emotional dependencies. To capture higher-order and high-frequency information, SDR-GNN utilizes weighted relationship aggregation, ensuring consistent semantic feature extraction across utterances. Additionally, it performs multifrequency aggregation in the spectral domain, enabling efficient recovery of incomplete modalities by extracting both high-and low-frequency information. Finally, multi-head attention is applied to fuse and optimize features for emotion recognition. Extensive experiments on various real-world datasets demonstrate that our approach is effective in incomplete multimodal learning and outperforms current state-of-the-art methods.",

      "text": "Multimodal Emotion Recognition in Conversations (ME RC)  [67, 46, 41, 45, 48, 49]  aims to identify the emotions expressed by each multimodal utterance in conversation scenes. Unlike traditional Unimodal Emotion Recognition in Conversations (UERC)  [31, 28, 47, 6, 5] , MERC can use textual, auditory, and visual modal information from the utterance to reveal more realistic emotions of the speaker by capturing the consistency and complementary semantics within and between modalities  [18, 61, 27, 43, 42, 37] . With the development of human-computer interaction, MERC has attracted significant attention from researchers because it can be widely used to understand and generate conversation  [15, 62, 39, 38] . However, most existing MERC methods usually assume that each utterance has complete modalities, ignoring the incomplete modality problem  [21, 16, 30, 50] . Unfortunately, obtaining complete multimodal data is incredibly challenging in practical conversation scenarios  [33] . For example, auditory data may not be available due to noise interference, visual data may not be available due to light or occlusion, and even more modal data may not be available due to sensor failure  [60, 7, 67] . Fig.  1  presents a sample conversation between two speakers, where each ⋆ Our code is publicly available at https://github.com/fufangze/SDR-GNN.\n\n* Corresponding author ORCID(s): utterance contains three modalities. The conversation on the right side illustrates the condition when modalities are incomplete.\n\nThe problem of incomplete modalities poses significant challenges for MERC tasks. To this end, researchers have proposed various methods to solve this problem mainly from how to perform modal recovery  [33, 60, 53, 22] . For instance, Pham et al.  [33, 8, 29, 1]  proposed the MCTN model considering the semantic consistency between modalities.\n\nMCTN constructs cyclic transformations between modalities through sequence modeling to learn robust joint representations and uses cyclic consistency loss to achieve modality recovery. Wang et al.  [60]  considered the consistency of distribution between modalities and proposed the DiCMoR model. DiCMoR reduces the distribution gap by mapping different modalities to a latent space with Gaussian distribution and samples the characteristic distribution of the latent space to achieve modal recovery. Sun et al.  [53, 40, 3, 44, 51]  considered the consistency of long-range semantics between modalities and proposed the EMT-DLFR model. EMT-DLFR captures consistent semantics in the global dialogue context by building a multi-modal Transformer and achieves modality recovery through feature reconstruction. Lian et al.  [22]  considered the complex relationship between multi-modal utterances and proposed the GCNet model. GC-Net uses graph neural networks to model context and speaker relationships separately to capture consistent semantics for missing modality recovery. Although these methods show good performance, they still have some limitations:\n\n(i) Limitations in capturing higher-order information. In single-modal or multi-modal emotion recognition, the distribution of modalities in conversations is typically fixed. However, in conversations with incomplete modalities, the absence of modalities is often unpredictable. Models need to adapt to modalities absence of varying degrees and under different circumstances. While existing graph-based models, including GCNet  [22, 2, 4] , do capture higher-order information through information propagation, they rely on traditional graph structures, which are limited to binary relationships between nodes. These fixed structure graphs often struggle to capture complex semantic dependencies in conversations, especially when adapting to various missing modalities. MMIN  [68]  proposed six possible missingmodality conditions, but it can only learn for individual utterances. In contrast, our approach utilizes a hypergraph structure, which effectively models higher-order relationships among multiple nodes  [10] . This allows the model to capture more complex and nuanced dependencies, overcoming the limitations of conventional graphs that GNN-based models face. Therefore, how to capture the complex semantic dependencies between utterances, adapt to different situations, and optimize the recovery of incomplete modalities is an issue that cannot be ignored.\n\n(ii) Limitations in handling high-frequency information. Much research shows that high-frequency signals that reflect dissimilarity are as crucial as low-frequency signals that reflect consistency in MERC tasks  [21, 16] . Because the message propagation of GNN  [12]  has lowpass filtering characteristics, node representation is achieved by aggregating consistent low-frequency information in the neighborhood and suppressing differential high-frequency information. This inclination towards low-frequency components results in over-smoothing, where distinctive emotional transitions-the high-frequency signals-are suppressed, masking important intra-modal shifts. Regrettably, the constructed utterances-emotion interaction graphs often have semantic inconsistencies, and it is crucial to retain highfrequency information. Our proposed SDR-GNN addresses this by preserving and leveraging high-frequency information to capture rapid transitions and local changes, which are integral for comprehensive emotional analysis. Consequently, simultaneously retaining and fusing high-and lowfrequency information to guide the recovery of incomplete modalities is a challenge that must be overcome.\n\nInspired by the above analysis, this paper proposes a novel Spectral Domain Reconstruction Graph Neural Network for Incomplete Multimodal Learning in Conversational Emotion Recognition, named SDR-GNN. SDR-GNN can capture the complex emotional dependencies between utterances while learning multi-frequency information in multimodal features for incomplete modal recovery to obtain better emotion recognition results. Specifically, SDR-GNN first simulates the modal missing problem in real conversation scenarios by randomly discarding some modal features, and adding speaker information to the discourse features to form multimodal nodes. Subsequently, to model the complex semantic dependencies between multimodal utterances, SDR-GNN constructs the emotional interaction graph from the context and speaker relationships based on a sliding window, where the nodes in the sliding window are fully connected and construct the context and speaker hyperedges separately. Next, to capture the complex emotional dependence between far and near utterances and learn multifrequency information in multimodal features, SDR-GNN uses a neighborhood relationship awareness layer, a hyperedge relationship awareness layer, and a multi-frequency information awareness layer separately for information propagation. Finally, SDR-GNN reconstructs based on the learned features to guide the recovery of incomplete modalities and uses multi-head attention for feature fusion to achieve emotion recognition. We conducted experiments on three conversational datasets, verifying the effectiveness of our method. The experimental results demonstrate that our SDR-GNN outperforms existing approaches. The main contributions of this paper can be summarized as follows:\n\n• Existing graph neural networks (GNNs) are constrained by their inherent limitations, which may lead to over-smoothing and the erasure of high-frequency signals, making it difficult to fully utilize multifrequency information. We have not only addressed this limitation but also applied our approach to multimodal emotion recognition under incomplete modalities, thereby filling the gap in current works.\n\n• We propose a novel framework, SDR-GNN, to deal with incomplete conversational data in the MERC task, which jointly considers the higher-order information of modalities and multi-frequency features, and fully utilizes the semantic dependence in both speaker and context for missing modality recovery and emotion recognition.\n\n• Experimental results on three benchmark datasets verify the effectiveness of our method. SDR-GNN outperforms existing state-of-the-art approaches in the domain of incomplete multimodal learning in conversational emotion recognition.",

Multimodal ERC leverages multiple data modalities, including text, audio, and visual data, to capture and analyze emotions more comprehensively during conversational exchanges.\n\nTo better utilize multimodal information to address the ERC problem, researchers have proposed various methods. MulT  [55]  model uses cross-modal transformers to capture long-range dependencies.

      "text": "Multimodal learning aims to utilize information from a variety of data modalities to improve generalization performance. However, in some conditions, modalities may be missing or unavailable. A straightforward method is to use existing data for classification. Additionally, there are strategies that conduct data imputation aiming to reconstruct missing data. We divide the existing methods into two categories: non-reconstruction and reconstruction methods.\n\nExisting non-reconstruction approaches primarily focus on the analysis of incomplete data, such as through maximizing correlations  [9, 24, 23] . Hotelling et al.  [20]  introduced CCA, which maximizes canonical correlations by linearly mapping multimodal features into a low-dimensional space. In contrast to CCA's linear focus, Andrew et al.  [9]  developed DCCA, which enhances traditional CCA by addressing its limitations related to linear associations. It employs deep neural networks to uncover more intricate, non-linear relationships across different modalities. Additionally, Wang et al.  [59]  introduced DCCAE. DCCAE advances CCA by incorporating autoencoders, which are designed to extract latent features from each modality. This approach optimizes both the reconstruction accuracy of the autoencoders and the canonical correlations, effectively balancing the integrity of modality-specific structures with the connectivity between modalities.\n\nReconstruction methods, on the other hand, aim to ensure data completeness, primarily through data imputation  [32, 25, 66] , generating missing data  [57, 54, 14] , or reconstructing incomplete data by learning feature representations. Parthasarathy et al.  [32]  proposed an attention-based model that fills missing video data with zero vectors. Zhang et al.  [66]  developed CPM-Net, which integrates an encoderless model with a clustering-like classification loss to learn features and pads missing modalities with average values. Moreover, several DNN-based models have been developed, including autoencoders  [54] , GAN  [58] , and Transformers  [63] .\n\nTo better reconstruct incomplete data, researchers started to explore feature representations. For example, Lian et al.\n\nproposed GCNet  [22] , which utilizes GNN-based models to capture different types of information in conversations to reconstruct missing modalities. Wang et al.  [60]  considered the consistency of data distributions to recover missing features.",

Each utterance 𝑢 𝑖 is spoken by 𝑝 𝑠(𝑢 𝑖 ) , where the function 𝑠(⋅) maps the index of utterance into its corresponding speaker.

      "text": "The main idea of Spectral Domain Reconstruction Graph Neural Network is to capture the multivariate relationships between domain nodes, resulting in better aggregation effects for the following reconstruction task. We first construct relation graph convolutional networks (R-GCN)  [35]  in capturing node features, capturing both contextual and speaker features. In addition, considering the dynamic absence of modalities, we construct a hypergraph with edge-dependent node weights to flexibly aggregate node information. Recent works has verified the effectiveness of multi-frequency emotional information in the ERC task  [16, 12] , therefore we design a frequency-aware module specifically to capture this information.\n\nWe have developed speaker interaction graphs and context interaction graphs as the primary modules for extracting emotion cues. In these graphs, edges measure the significance of connections between nodes, where the type of edge determines the propagation method of various information. While both the speaker and context graphs use identical edges, each edge represents a distinct dependency.\n\nEdges: Considering the overwhelming number of connections when each node interacts with all others, we streamline this by limiting node interactions to a fixed-size context window 𝑤, following insights from previous research that emphasize the importance of local context. Therefore, a node 𝑣 𝑖 only connects with nearby nodes within the context window {𝑣 𝑗 } 𝑗∈[𝑚𝑎𝑥(𝑖-𝑤,1),𝑚𝑖𝑛(𝑖+𝑤,𝐿)] , significantly reducing complexity. We select 𝑤 from the set {1, 2, 3, 4} and denote the edge from node 𝑣 𝑖 to 𝑣 𝑗 as 𝑒 𝑖𝑗 ∈  (|| = 𝑛 + 2𝑤 -1).\n\nSpeaker Interaction Graph: The speaker interaction graph leverages the various speakers and their corresponding utterances to map out the dependencies among speakers within a conversation. Each edge 𝑒 𝑖𝑗 in the graph is tagged with a speaker identifier 𝛼 𝑖𝑗 from the set 𝛼, which encompasses all speaker types present in the dialogue. The cardinality of 𝛼, represented as 𝛼, indicates the number of distinct speaker types. For each connection 𝑒 𝑖𝑗 , 𝛼 𝑖𝑗 denotes the directional flow from speaker 𝑝 𝑠(𝑢 𝑖 ) to speaker 𝑝 𝑠(𝑢 𝑗 ) , where 𝑝 𝑠(𝑢 𝑖 ) and 𝑝 𝑠(𝑢 𝑗 ) are the speaker identifiers for 𝑢 𝑖 and 𝑢 𝑗 , respectively.\n\nContext Interaction Graph: Context interaction graph utilizes contextual information to delineate the contextual dependencies within a conversation. Each edge 𝑒 𝑖𝑗 is assigned a context type identifier 𝛽 𝑖𝑗 ∈ |𝛽|, which contains all possible context types in the discussion. The determination of 𝛽 values is influenced by the relative positioning of 𝑢 𝑖 and 𝑢 𝑗 within the dialogue, with possible values including backward, present, forward. Therefore, the total number of context types, |𝛽|, is three.\n\nWeighted HyperGraph: In hypergraphs, we define two types of weights: an edge weight, 𝜆(𝑒), for each edge 𝑒, and a node weight, 𝛾 𝑒 (𝑣), for each node 𝑣 incident to edge 𝑒, also known as edge-dependent node weight. Intuitively, 𝛾 𝑒 (𝑣) represents the contribution of node 𝑣 to the hyperedge 𝑒, enriching the representation of detailed multimodal and contextual dependencies. Consequently, edge-dependent node weights are expressed using a weighted incidence matrix. Ĥ ∈ ℝ 𝑛×|| :\n\nGraph learning: We use R-GCN to aggregate the local information in the graph, then use hypergraph for weighted aggregation. The calculation is shown as follows:\n\nwhere\n\nis the input at layer 𝑙. 𝐖 𝑒 =diag(𝜆(𝑒 1 ), ⋯ , 𝜆(𝑒 𝑖𝑗 )) is the edge weight matrix.\n\nFrequency-Aware Graph: Although speaker graph and context graph can capture feature dependencies, they still follow the generic graph learning protocol, which aggregates and smooths signals from the local neighborhood, thereby erasing high-frequency signals  [16, 12] . These signals can be crucial for ERC tasks. To effectively learn different types of frequency information between the central node and its neighbors, we designed a self-gating mechanism. Specifically, it calculates the correlation between the central node and its neighbors, learning the multi-frequency information of multimodal features. Mathematically:\n\nHere, 𝑊 𝑟 3 , 𝑊 𝑟 4 ∈ ℝ 2ℎ are trainable weight matrices, and tanh(⋅) is the hyperbolic tangent function, which scales the input to the range [-1,1]. In the context of graph neural networks, low-frequency signals can be thought of as generalized information propagated across large areas of the network, indicating similarity or commonality among nodes. High-frequency signals, conversely, emphasize differences or specific characteristics distinct to neighboring nodes. These signals are derived through the spectral decomposition of the graph Laplacian, which allows us to separate these frequency components mathematically. Through this mechanism, the outputs of 𝑊 𝑟  3 𝑣 𝑠𝑝 𝑖𝑗 and 𝑊 𝑟 4 𝑣 𝑐𝑜 𝑖𝑗 effectively gauge the significance of various frequency components. The selfgating mechanism, as proposed in our SDR-GNN, enables dynamic differentiation and integration of these frequency signals, helping retain essential low-frequency information while preserving critical high-frequency details crucial for tasks involving nuanced data. For example, if 𝑊 𝑟  3 𝑣 𝑠𝑝 𝑖𝑗 < 0, high-frequency messages are prominent, signifying a greater difference between node 𝑖 and its neighbor 𝑗, and vice versa.\n\nTo aggregate these representations, we concatenate them to form the final representation of the Local Enhancement Graph:",

Compared with the reconstruction methods  [33, 60, 22, 68] , our SDR-GNN perform better. We argue that these baselines do not use the multi-frequency information in conversation. Our method utilizes multi-frequency signals to reconstruct missing modalities, resulting in better classification performance.\n\n2. Our method exhibits less performance degradation with increasing missing rates compared to others. For example, in IEMOCAP (four-class), while other methods see performance drops between 6.98% and 37.70% as the missing rate increases to 0.7, our SDR-GNN declines by only 5.17%. Moreover, SDR-GNN shows greater improvement as the missing rate rises; in CMU-MOSEI, the improvement is 3.21% at a missing rate of 0.1, reaching 8.6% at 0.7, indicating robustness in scenarios with high missing rates. 3. Experimental results demonstrate SDR-GNN also exhibits better performance when multimodal data is complete ( = 0.0), For all datasets, our SDR-GNN improve 0.7% ∼ 2.7%. These results validate the effectiveness of our method on both complete and incomplete multimodal data.",

Fig.  3a∼3h  show confusion matrices on IEMOCAP (four-class) and IEMOCAP (six-class) under different missing rates. The rows represent the predicted labels, and the columns represent the actual emotional labels.\n\nFig.  3a∼3d  depict the confusion matrices on IEMOCAP (four-class). From these matrices, we observe no significant decrease in the accuracy of recognizing various emotion categories as the missing rate increases. This indicates that our SDR-GNN can effectively recognize conversations with high missing rates. However, as the missing rate increases, we notice that conversations truly labeled as 'happy' are more likely to be misclassified as 'angry'. We attribute this to the possibility that, with significant data loss, the model may struggle to capture subtle features distinguishing between happy and angry emotions. For instance, incomplete tone and emphasis information in audio may hinder the model's ability to differentiate between excited high tones and angry high tones. In the expression of happy and angry emotions, certain expressions may appear similar to some extent, particularly when multimodal information is incomplete. Without contextual support from other modalities, the model may fail to interpret these subtle differences accurately. Fig.  3e∼3h  depict the confusion matrix on IEMOCAP (six-class). Similar to IEMOCAP (four-class), the model can maintain recognition accuracy even as the loss rate increases. However, unlike IEMOCAP (four-class), IEMO-CAP (six-class) introduces two additional labels: \"excited\" and \"frustrated,\" which adds complexity to the model's recognition task. From these confusion matrices, it's evident that statements labeled as \"happy\" are more prone to being misclassified as \"angry\" or \"excited.\" This is reasonable since the model struggles to differentiate statements with intense emotions, particularly when the loss rate is high. Moreover, statements with a true label of \"neutral\" are often mistakenly identified as \"frustrated\". From a frequency perspective, we believe that emotions such as \"neutral\" exhibit low-frequency signals that tend towards zero. However, when the loss rate increases, some low-frequency signals are erroneously amplified, leading to misjudgments by the model. Additionally, \"frustrated\" is frequently misclassified as \"anger,\" likely due to similarities in language features between frustrated and anger, such as negative emotions and vocabulary. This similarity poses challenges in accurately distinguishing between these two emotions.",

Meanwhile, as the missing rate increases, the disparity in performance between SDR-GNN and the comparison system widens significantly.This observation underscores the significance of leveraging incomplete data to enhance the performance of conversational learning models. By effectively incorporating incomplete information, SDR-GNN demonstrates superior adaptability and robustness in handling incomplete multimodal data.\n\nThe experimental results demonstrate that despite the incompleteness of the data modality, it retains significant utility. It is imperative to concurrently leverage both complete and incomplete modal data to enhance contextual understanding and improve recognition outcomes.

To evaluate the reconstruction performance of different methods, we calculated the mean square error (MSE) between the reconstructed data of the missing modalities and the real data, in line with previous works.\n\nFig.  5  shows the performance of the reconstructed data under different missing rates. A lower MSE indicates a smaller difference between the reconstructed data and the real data, implying better reconstruction performance. We observe that as the missing rate increases, the MSE also increases. This is because a higher missing rate leads to a reduction in data volume, making it more difficult for the model to reconstruct the data.\n\nThe experimental results demonstrate that SDR-GNN outperforms other methods in most cases.

      "text": "Our SDR-GNN model includes four hyper-parameters: the interaction window size 𝑤, the hidden layer dimension ℎ, reconstruction loss function weight 𝑒 and the number of hypergraphs layer 𝑙. We assessed the impact of these parameters through experiments on the IEMOCAP (fourclass) dataset under various missing rates, selecting 𝑤 from {1, 2, 3, 4} and ℎ from {100, 150, 200, 250}, 𝑒 ranges from 0.1 to 0.9 and 𝑙 from {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6}. The results of the experiments are displayed in Table  6 , Fig.  7  and Fig.  8 .\n\nIn most cases, the classification performance improves first the degrades as 𝑤 increase. This can be explained from two aspects. On one hand, a bigger window size can contain more utterances, which helps capturing and learning contextual information. On the other hand, a large window size will contain a large number of edges, which may include  more irrelevant information. This will increase the difficulty of model learning.\n\nSimilarly, an increase in the hidden layer dimension ℎ generally results in improved performance. At the same time, we also observed that when ℎ becomes too large, it leads to a decline in the model's performance. as seen in Table  6 . A larger ℎ provides a greater number of trainable parameters, thereby enhancing the model's ability to capture and represent complex feature interactions. This is particularly beneficial for discerning subtle patterns and distinctions in the data, which are crucial for accurate classification. However, this increase in parameters also heightens the risk of overfitting. Therefore, choosing appropriate parameters is crucial for improving the performance of the model.\n\nTo investigate the impact of the hyperparameters 𝑒 and 𝑙, we conducted experiments on the IEMOCAP (Four-class) dataset with a missing rate of  = 0.4.\n\nAs shown in Fig.  6 , when the weight of the reconstruction loss function 𝑒 increases from 0.1 to 0.9, the model's performance first rises and then declines, with the best performance observed around 𝑒 = 0.5. We believe that the reconstruction task and the classification task should have similar weights. If the reconstruction task dominates, the classification results deteriorate; conversely, if the model focuses too much on the classification task, the quality of the reconstructed data decreases, which negatively impacts classification performance. Therefore, in our actual experiments, we set 𝑒 to 0.5 to balance the weights between the classification and reconstruction tasks, achieving good results in most cases. From Fig.  7 , we can observe that as the number of layers 𝑙 increases, the model's performance also first improves and then declines. This is because with fewer layers, the number of propagated nodes is limited, while with more layers, redundant data propagation does not further enhance feature extraction. Additionally, it increases the risk of over-fitting.",

We observe that as the degree of missing modalities increases, the performance of all models decreases, as it becomes more challenging to predict the outcome with less data.\n\nIn the dialogue shown in Fig.  8 , 𝑢5 can be considered a high-frequency signal sentence because SpeakerA shifts from Neutral to Anger, displaying intense emotion that stands out distinctly from the surrounding context. Most models perform poorly in predicting 𝑢5, except for SDR-GNN and MMIN. MMIN is designed to analyze individual utterances, so the surrounding context does not influence its predictions. In contrast, other models that rely on context for feature extraction or clustering algorithms may lose 𝑢5's high-frequency signal during the feature capturing and signal propagation process. However, SDR-GNN effectively differentiates multi-frequency information for feature aggregation, preventing this issue.\n\nOur method consistently achieves high accuracy across all situations, demonstrating its effectiveness.
