      "text": "Multimodal Sentiment Analysis (MuSe) 2021 is a challenge focusing on the tasks of sentiment and emotion, as well as physiologicalemotion and emotion-based stress recognition through more comprehensively integrating the audio-visual, language, and biological signal modalities. The purpose of MuSe 2021 is to bring together communities from different disciplines; mainly, the audio-visual emotion recognition community (signal-based), the sentiment analysis community (symbol-based), and the health informatics community. We present four distinct sub-challenges: MuSe-Wilder and MuSe-Stress which focus on continuous emotion (valence and arousal) prediction; MuSe-Sent , in which participants recognise five classes each for valence and arousal; and MuSe-Physio , in which the novel aspect of 'physiological-emotion' is to be predicted. For this year's challenge, we utilise the MuSe-CaR dataset focusing on user-generated reviews and introduce the Ulm-TSST dataset, which displays people in stressful depositions. This paper also provides detail on the state-of-the-art feature sets extracted from these datasets for utilisation by our baseline model, a Long Short-Term Memory-Recurrent Neural Network. For each sub-challenge, a competitive baseline for participants is set; namely, on test, we report a Concordance Correlation Coefficient (CCC) of .4616 CCC for MuSe-Wilder ; .5088 CCC for MuSe-Stress , and .4908 CCC for MuSe-Physio . For MuSe-Sent an F1 score of 32.82 % is obtained. \n CCS CONCEPTS • Information systems → Multimedia and multimodal retrieval; • Computing methodologies → Artificial intelligence.",

      "text": "In the 2nd edition of the Multimodal Sentiment Analysis in Real-life Media (MuSe) Challenge, we address four tasks incorporating novelties in each: emotion, physiological-emotion, and stress recognition as well as sentiment classification. In the Multimodal Continuous Emotions in-the-wild sub-challenge (MuSe-Wilder ) and Multimodal Sentiment in-the-wild Classification sub-challenge (MuSe-Sent ), one has to recognise emotional dimensions (arousal, valence) in a regression and classification manner. These tasks are based on work previously outlined for the MuSe 2020 challenge  [42]  and feature substantially improved methods for target creation. The first improvement is the application of Rater Aligned Annotation Weighting (RAAW), a gold standard fusion method for continuous annotations taking both the varied annotator reaction times (aligning) and inter-rater agreements (subjectivity) into account. Additionally, intelligent extraction of valuable features from continuous emotion gold-standards is used to cluster segment-level signals to representative classes so that contributors are faced with two fiveway classifications of the level of valence and arousal. These two sub-challenges (MuSe-Wilder and MuSe-Sent ) are motivated by the fundamental nature of gold-standard creation on which all tasks and applications of the field are premised. In the Multimodal Emotional Stress sub-challenge (MuSe-Stress ), valence and arousal are predicted, from people in stressed dispositions. This sub-challenge is motivated by the high level of stress many people face in modern societies  [6] . Given the increasing availability of low-resource equipment (e. g., smart-watches) able to record biological signals to Table  1 : Reported are the number (#) of unique videos, and the duration for each sub-challenge hh :mm :ss. Partitioning of the MuSe-CaR dataset is applied for each of the two sub-challenges. Ulm-TSST has a total duration of 5 :47 :27 after preprocessing, using the same split for MuSe-Stress and MuSe-Physio . track wellbeing, we propose the Multimodal Physiological-Arousal sub-challenge (MuSe-Physio ). Adapted from MuSe-Stress , the arousal annotations from humans are fused (using RAAW) with galvanic skin response (also known as Electrodermal Activity (EDA)) signals for predicting physiological-arousal. Both are set up as regression tasks offering additional biological signals (e. g., heart rate, and respiration) for modelling.\n\nFor the introduced sub-challenges, two datasets are utilised. As last year  [42] , we reuse the Multimodal Sentiment Analysis in Car Reviews data (MuSe-CaR)  [43]  for the MuSe-Wilder and MuSe-Sent sub-challenges. Including almost 40 hours of video data, it is the most extensive emotion annotated multimodal dataset, gathered in-the-wild with the intention of further understanding realworld Multimodal Sentiment Analysis (MSA), in particular the emotional engagement that takes place during English-speaking product reviews. Within MuSe-CaR, the subjects are aged between 20 and 60 years, and the spoken word is entirely transcribed. For the first time, a sub-set of the novel audio-visual-text Ulm-Trier Social Stress dataset (Ulm-TSST), featuring German-speaking individuals in a stress-induced situation caused by the Trier Social Stress Test (TSST), is used in this year's MuSe-Stress and MuSe-Physio sub-challenges. The initial state of Ulm-TSST consists of 110 individuals (10 hours), richly annotated by self-reported, and continuous dimensional ratings of emotion (valence and arousal). In addition to audio, video, textual features, the Ulm-TSST includes four biological signals captured at a sampling rate of 1 kHz; EDA, Electrocardiogram (ECG), Respiration (RESP), and heart rate (BPM). Both datasets provide a common testing bed with a held-back labelled test set, to explore the modalities and employ state-of-the-art models under well-defined and strictly comparable conditions.\n\nThe goal of the MuSe challenges are to provide a paradigm that is of interest across several communities and to encourage a fusion of disciplines. We ideally aim for participation that strives for the development of unified approaches applicable to what we perceive as synergistic tasks which have arisen from different academic traditions: on the one hand, we have complex, dimensional emotion annotations that reflect a broad variety of emotions, grounded in the psychological and social sciences relating to the expression of behaviour, and on the other hand, we provide sentiment classes as it is common in sentiment analysis from (multimodal) text-focused modelling. These fields are rooted within Affective Computing (AC), of which a core aspect is the intelligent processing of uni-modal signals. Up to now, the focus in AC when predicting emotion such Figure  1 : Sample gold standard computation using RAAW for emotion annotations (dark grey), aligned (warping paths in light grey), and fused from the MuSe-Toolbox  [49] . The instance on the left side is from MuSe-Wilder (id: 100), the resulting signal (orange) is displayed and compared to the average annotation (blue). The right image displays a fusion from MuSe-Physio (id:11), where raters 1 and 2 for arousal (dark grey) are combined with the EDA signal (green).\n\nas by valence and arousal dimensions, was mostly with lower attention to research made on textual information  [21, 39] . However, the communities appear to be converging even more in recent years (such as supported by the MuSe 2020  [42]  challenge), finding great benefit from multimodal approaches  [2, 15, 33] . As an example, both the 2020 and 2021 INTERSPEECH Computational Paralinguistics (ComParE) Challenge have included textual features in an endeavour to more reliably predict valence  [37, 38] . The second motivation of MuSe is to compare the merits of each of the core modalities (audio, visual, biological, social, and textual signal), as well as various multimodal fusion approaches. Participants can extract their own features or use the provided standard feature sets from the baseline models.\n\nThe paper's structure is as follows: First, the four sub-challenges with the corresponding datasets are explained in detail, followed by a description of the challenge conditions. Next, we describe the extracted features from different modalities and the applied pre-processing and alignment for the baseline modelling. Finally, we summarise our baseline results and conclude our findings. A summary of the challenge results can be found in  [46] .",

The evaluation metric for all continuous time-based regression tasks is Concordance Correlation Coefficient (CCC), a well-understood measure  [29]  of reproducibility, often used in challenges  [35, 42, 52] .

      "text": "The MuSe-Wilder is an extension of the MuSe-Wild 2020 subchallenge, where participants had to predict emotional dimensions (valence, arousal) in a time-continuous manner. The amount of data utilised from MuSe-CaR is shown in Table  1 . The valence dimension is often referred to as the emotional component of the generic term sentiment analysis and is often used interchangeably  [26, 32, 51] . Human annotation of continuous emotions leads to disagreements between raters, e. g., due to differences in perception  [19]  and reaction time  [27] , which should be mitigated by fusion to a gold standard. Since this signal is the prediction target, a variety of fusion methods are available in the literature  [16, 28]  and this development has motivated other challenges  [34] . This year's MuSe-Wilder emotion recognition task is based on a completely novel continuous annotator fusion technique RAAW, which targets the difficulties of combining subjective emotion annotations for a gold standard annotation present. For this, we employ our fusion method on a minimum of five different ratings that weights inter-rater agreements as well as considers the varied reaction times as displayed in Figure  1 . The varying rater lag that is inherent to all annotation signals will be targeted by aligning the standardised (per annotator) ratings using a generalised Canonical Time Warping (CTW) method  [57] . The Evaluator Weighted Estimator (EWE)  [16]  is then used to fuse the aligned, individual signals by weighting a signal depending on the inter-rater agreement to the mean of all others. This technique is described in length in  [49] . The resulting distribution is shown in Figure  2 .",

      "text": "Mapping continuous emotion annotations to discrete classes are considered a highly ambiguous and challenging task and have so far hardly been computed successfully in a time-continuous fashion  [53] . In general, classes are often considered a simplified concept for interpretation compared to dimensional representations. In MuSe-Sent , participants will have to predict five advanced sentiment classes for each emotion dimension of valence and arousal on a segment-level, based on audio-visual recordings and the transcribed speech of MuSe-CaR. The sub-challenge uses the topicbased segmentation from MuSe 2020  [42] . The classes are extracted using a novel method of the MuSe-Toolbox  [49] . which aims to find a mapping between continuous dimensional and categorical representations of emotion through the extraction of time-series features and the application of unsupervised clustering.\n\nMore specifically, we first extract a range of time-series features on a segment-level 1  based on the continuous RAAW-fused annotations. The absolute features are normalised depending on the varying length of a segment to limit undesirable properties solely due to the influence of the segment length. To reduce the feature space, we apply Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to project our data to a five dimensional space of principal components which are derived from the eigenvectors of the covariance matrix. The transformed data is further clustered into five class clusters using a) the 𝑘-means algorithm  [24]  for valence and b) a Gaussian Mixture clustering model  [10]  for arousal. To ensure that the development and test set have no effect on the generated classes, we only apply this process on the training set segments. The segments belonging to the development and test partitions, are then 'predicted' by assigning the cluster with the closest centre to each data-point. These clusters are evaluated through both qualitative and quantitative measures: (1) the amount of data-points of the smallest class is larger than a quarter of by-chance-level  2  (2) to evaluate cluster cohesion and separation, the widely used Silhouette Coefficient (SILC)  [36]  is calculated, ranging from -1 to 1 (closer to 1 is superior). For the two chosen settings, we achieve a SILC of 0.19 and 0.10, respectively for valence and arousal clusters. The PCA leads to a denser representation along the orthogonal axes, making a higher SILC value hard to achieve, since the metric is prone to error when clusters show different kinds of cluster densities  [22] , which naturally occurs in this setting.\n\nSince the features reflect characteristics of the emotional annotation and not just the mean value as in last years' MuSe-Topic task  [42] , class descriptions, i. e., low, medium, or high would inadequately reflect the meaning. With this in mind, to gain understanding of the classes, we display the most distinctive features in Figure  3  for interpretation showing the named valence classes as 𝑉 # and arousal as 𝐴 # while # represents the class number, not implying any specific order. For example, segments from classes 𝑉 1 and 𝐴 2 have a comparatively large (to the mean of all other classes) 'standard deviation' and 'sum of changes', which indicates a higher annotation fluctuation and intensity than other classes. The distribution of segments across the classes can be found in Table  2 .",

This sub-challenge is motivated by real-world applications for emotion recognition and further motivated by stress in modern life. In this novel sub-challenge, the idea of 'multimodal' sentiment analysis is pushed further by the inclusion of biological signals that have been shown to be applicable for recognising physiological stress  [31] , and for emotion recognition  [40] .\n\nParticipants are provided with the multimodal Ulm-TSST database, in which subjects were recorded under a highly stress-induced free speech task, following the TSST protocol  [20] . For the TSST, after a brief period of preparation the subjects are asked to give an oral presentation, within a job-interview setting, observed by two interviewees who remain silent for the period of five minutes. To allow consistent data partitions, we only keep data recorded under the same experimental conditions. The resulting 69 participants (49 of them female) are aged between 18 and 39 years, providing a total amount of about 6 hours of data for the MuSe-Stress and MuSe-Physio sub-challenges (cf. Table  1 ). Besides audio, video, and text, the participants can optionally utilise the ECG, RESP and BPM signals.\n\nThe dataset has been rated by three annotators continuously for the emotional dimensions of valence and arousal, at a 2Hz sampling rate, and a gold standard is obtained by the fusion of annotator ratings, utilising the RAAW method, as described in Section 2.1 from the MuSe-Toolbox  [49] . When creating the fusion a mean CC inter-rater agreement of 0.204 (± 0.200) for valence and 0.186 (± 0.230) for arousal is obtained. The distributions of the valence and arousal signals for the dataset are depicted in Figure  2 .",

Again, for this task, the Ulm-TSST dataset is employed, where the TSST was utilised as a standardised and renowned stressor, allowing for a controlled setting with high-quality data while maintaining a naturalistic subject behaviour.\n\nPhysiological signals, including EDA have been used as a feature in at least one other multimodal emotion challenge  [9] . However, we consider this sub-challenge to be the first time the physiological signal is combined with the emotional -human-annotatedsignal. From all the biological signals available in the Ulm-TSST dataset, we choose to use the EDA signal, as not only are the signal characteristics subjectively similar to continuous emotion as exemplarily depicted in Figure  1 , but the signal itself has been shown in the literature to be a psycho-physiological indication of emotional arousal  [7] . Given that in the context of an interview, arousal may also appear to be a more hidden emotion, we consider that the fusion of arousal and EDA may improve recognition and offers a more objective marker for a speaker's arousal  [7] . Further variants are introduced in  [4] . To obtain the combined emotion and EDA signal gold standard, we again utilise the RAAW fusion strategy. However, in this case, the lowest weighted annotator is excluded and replaced with the EDA signal. The EDA signal is downsampled to 2 Hz and smoothed slightly before fusion through a Savitzky-Golay filtering approach (window size of 26 steps), to avoid irrelevant, fine-grained artefacts in the signal. For this gold standard of emotion, we obtain an inter agreement of 0.233 (±0.289), which was improved compared to the arousal gold standard obtained in MuSe-Stress .",

The input feature sequences are input into uni-and bi-directional LSTM-RNNs with a hidden state dimensionality of ℎ = {32, 64, 128}, to encode the feature vector sequences. We test different numbers of LSTM-RNN layers 𝑛 = {1, 2, 4}. Based on experiences from initial experiments, some hyperparameter searches are task-dependently executed: MuSe-Wilder we search for a suitable learning rate 𝑙𝑟 = {0.0001, 0.001, 0.005}; for MuSe-Sent 𝑙𝑟 = {0.001, 0.005, 0.01}; for MuSe-Stress and MuSe-Physio 𝑙𝑟 = {0.0001, 0.0002, 0.0005, 0.001}. As we observed overfitting in some settings of MuSe-Physio , we also tried L2-Regularisation with a penalty of 0.01 for this task.\n\nThe sequence of hidden vectors from the final LSTM-RNN layer is further encoded by a feed-forward layer that outputs either a one-dimensional prediction sequence of logits for each time step (regression), or a single-value per prediction target (classification).\n\nIn the training processes, the features and labels of every input video are further segmented via a windowing approach  [42, 43, 50] . For MuSe-Wilder and MuSe-Sent , we use a window size of 200 steps (50 s) and a hop size of 100 steps (25 s). For MuSe-Stress and MuSe-Physio , a window size of 300 steps (150 s) and a hop size of 50 steps (25 s) proved to be reasonable choices.",

Across both targets, we find that LSTM-RNN models with a bidirectional setting and at least two layers tend to achieve better results for this task than smaller architectures. Partially, we see improvements when we apply late fusion. For valence, utilising the predictions of VGGface and BERT yields a performance of 32.91 % F1-score on the test set. For arousal, the audio-visual fusion set-up (VGGish and FAU) also improves on the test set, with an F1 score of 35.12 %. Looking at the combined scores (mean of valence and arousal), using the BERT features alone comes out on top for the development set, reaching a 35.48 % F1 score, while fusing the video-and text-based predictions achieves the highest F1 score of 32.82 % on the test set.",

Having searched the hyperparameter combinations mentioned, we achieve the best results on all settings with a 4-layered unidirectional LSTM equipped with 64-dimensional hidden states and a learning rate of 0.0002 with a maximum of 100 epochs, and early stopping with a patience of 15 epochs. Here, eGeMAPS outperforms all other single feature sets for the prediction of valence, achieving .5845 CCC on development and .5018 CCC on the test set. Regarding arousal, eGeMAPS is the best scoring single feature set, leading to .4304 and .4416 CCC on development and test set, respectively. For both valence and arousal prediction, the fusions of the best audio and vision feature sets result in the best performance overall. They achieve CCC values of .6966 (development) and .5614 (test) for valence, and .5043 (development) 7 Of note, besides eGeMAPS, we also normalise the VGGish features for predicting arousal.  and .4562 (test) for arousal.. It is notable that the text feature set, BERT , performs considerably worse than the best audio and visual features.\n\nWe found that, in general, valence reaches a stronger final result than arousal for this task. While this is not surprising for text features, it counters conventional expectations for the audio modality. A major reason for the poor arousal prediction results may be the TSST scenario, which imitates a job interview. Typically, interviewees try to remain neutral, suppressing nervousness, hence, the arousal shown to their counterpart would be minimal, thus, making arousal more difficult to detect in the Ulm-TSST data set than other comparable multimodal emotion recognition data sets.\n\nAlthough we do not evaluate the provided bio-signal features systematically here, we encourage participants to explore them. To give an example, we achieve .2495 and .1537 CCC for valence on the development and test sets, respectively, by using only the three provided bio-signals (at a sampling rate of 2 Hz) as features in a four-layer LSTM. Similarly, they show also promising results for the prediction of arousal, reaching .1954 CCC on the development and .2189 CCC on test partition.",

      "text": "In this paper, we introduced MuSe 2021 -the second Multimodal Sentiment Analysis challenge. MuSe 2021 utilises the MuSe-CaR multimodal corpus of emotional car reviews and the Ulm-TSST corpus, including bio-signals, which are newly featured for the MuSe challenge. The 2021 challenge is comprised of four sub-challenges, aimed for predicting in: i) MuSe-Wilder , the level of the affective dimensions of valence (corresponding to sentiment) and arousal; ii) MuSe-Sent , five classes of each, valence and arousal, from video parts containing certain topics; iii) MuSe-Stress , the level of continuous valence and arousal from stressful situations; and iv) MuSe-Physio a combination of arousal and EDA signals. By intention, we decided to use open-source software to extract a wide range of feature sets to deliver the highest possible transparency and realism for the baselines. Besides the features, we also share the raw data and the developed code for our baselines publicly. The official baseline for each sub-challenge is for MuSe-Wilder .5974 for continuous valence using late fusion and .3386 for continuous arousal using DeepSpectrum features; for the five-class classification MuSe-Sent , an F1 score of 32.91 % for valence utilising late fusion of vision and text and 35.12 % for arousal utilising a late fusion of audio-video; for MuSe-Stress , a CCC of .5614 for valence and .4562 for arousal, both based on fusion of the best audio and visual features; and finally, for MuSe-Physio , a CCC of .4908 for physiological-emotion prediction.\n\nThe baselines are improved through the use of a simple fusion method and show the challenge ahead for multimodal sentiment analysis. In the participants' and future efforts, we hope for novel and exciting combinations of the modalities -such as linking modalities at earlier stages in the pipeline or more closely.",
