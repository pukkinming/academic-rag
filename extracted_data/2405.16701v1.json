      "text": "Capturing complex temporal relationships between video and audio modalities is vital for Audio-Visual Emotion Recognition (AVER). However, existing methods lack attention to local details, such as facial state changes between video frames, which can reduce the discriminability of features and thus lower recognition accuracy. In this paper, we propose a Detail-Enhanced Intra-and Inter-modal Interaction network (DE-III) for AVER, incorporating several novel aspects. We introduce optical flow information to enrich video representations with texture details that better capture facial state changes. A fusion module integrates the optical flow estimation with the corresponding video frames to enhance the representation of facial texture variations. We also design attentive intra-and inter-modal feature enhancement modules to further improve the richness and discriminability of video and audio representations. A detailed quantitative evaluation shows that our proposed model outperforms all existing methods on three benchmark datasets for both concrete and continuous emotion recognition. To encourage further research and ensure replicability, we will release our full code upon acceptance.",

      "text": "Emotion perception is attracting ever-increasing research attention due to its wide range of applications, such as affective computing  [32] , human-computer interaction  [3] , and social robotics  [34] . Multi-modal emotion recognition, especially integrating audio and video (i.e. AVER), is particularly important since it makes use of the information present in two modalities that are vital to human communication. Unlike single-modal emotion recognition, multi-modal emotion recognition has access to different representations of the same emotion from different modalities. This improves feature representation capabilities and distinguishability, leading to improved recognition accuracy  [36, 8] .\n\nHowever, there are still two challenges that are the focus of ongoing research in AVER: (i) how to enhance the representation of fine details within modalities, such as tiny details of facial motion (e.g. due to micro-expressions), and (ii) how ȧ # ȧ ( ȧ )\n\n. . .\n\nPooling Pooling Fig.  1 . Overview of our proposed method DE-III. Given video frames vi and audio fragments ai, we extract features and pass these through separate Conformer encoders. We introduce explicit information about facial motions -captured by optical flow oi -to enhance video feature representations, with a new pair-wise O-V attention fusion module that effectively integrates the information from optical flow and video frames. We propose an inter-modal feature enhancement module (large boxes near top) to attentively fuse the associated audio and video representations in both directions, i.e. audio-to-video and video-to-audio. During training, the final emotion predictions are calculated independently from three sets of features: the video features albeit with audio information fused (i.e. without the model components in the chequered box); the converse using the audio features; and finally using both sets of features after a further fusion stage. During inference, we use the prediction head that performed best on validation data.\n\nto better leverage inter-modal associations to fully exploit the complementary information from different modalities. Solving both will enable learning better feature representations, and improve emotion recognition accuracy\n\nWhen learning features from one modality, intra-modal temporal relationship mining  [44, 11, 42]  and feature detail enhancement  [39]  are important ways to make features more discriminative. For instance,  [42]  proposed an adaptive graph attention network to explore the relationship between frames of videos for microexpression recognition, while  [39]  introduced optical flow to replace face images for micro-expression recognition based on a multi-scale feature representation. However, these methods focus on the single-modal setting, and cannot exploit information from multiple modalities.  [44]  used self-attention  [37]  within each modality to enhance their representation and then fused them by a linear-based function to classify; however this cannot fully account for the complex, nonlinear relationships between audio and video.\n\nMulti-modal approaches have recently become mainstream  [24, 28, 41]  since considering both audio and video further improves representations, by fusing information in associated video frames and audio fragments. For example,  [8]  explored the effectiveness of different variants of transformer-based inter-modal attention mechanisms for AVER and showed inter-modal interaction can significantly improve performance. However, although inter-modal interaction improves recognition, these methods do not investigate modeling temporal relationships within each modality.  [13]  adopts a multi-branch joint auxiliary training method, designing independent audio and video branches and multi-modal fusion to enhance feature relationships, which greatly improves recognition performance.  [16, 15]  used a network shared across modalities to encourage consistency of the multi-modal feature space. However, since different modalities have different feature distributions and properties, a shared network may not fully capture the unique characteristics of each modality, resulting in information loss.\n\nMost of the relationship modeling strategies mentioned above  [35, 17, 16, 15 ] model temporal relationships based on implicit appearance representation of video frames and audio fragments, but ignore an inherent challenge of AVER -that in video features the frame-to-frame variations of faces are much weaker than in audio. For example, there may be significant changes in content and intonation between two audio fragments, while there is little difference between video frames. It is clear that these missing explicit details, especially state changes between face frames of videos, may lead to reduced discriminability of feature representations during the relationship modeling process, thereby affecting the accuracy of AVER.\n\nWe address these issues by introducing a multi-modal interaction network (Figure  1 ) that incorporates an explicit representation of visual detail changes between frames, and which can better fuse the complementary information from video and audio. Different from methods that directly model relationships between local regions of a facial sequence  [30, 12, 19, 10] , optical flow is a simple and effective way to represent the state changes between the facial frames. Optical flow can enhance the discriminability of visual representations by directly highlighting significant detail differences between frames, especially those texture changes that can express facial emotions  [39] . To this end, we propose a novel detail-enhanced intra-and inter-modal interactions network (called DE-III) for AVER, which integrates explicit optical flow information into an end-to-end multi-modal interaction framework. In addition, two independent multi-modal interaction fusion mechanisms and multiple residual connections further alleviate the information loss problem in existing shared interaction strategies  [16, 15] . Our main contributions are as follows:\n\nwe explicitly capture detail changes between video frames using optical flow, and integrate this information using a lightweight attentive fusion module; we design novel detail-enhanced intra-and inter-modal interaction modules for the video and audio modalities, which can effectively fuse associated information of one modality into the other modality and reduce information loss by residual connections.\n\nWe evaluate the resulting model and several variants on three widely used benchmarks and obtain highly competitive results including a new state-of-the-art on multiple metrics, e.g. 83.7% F1-Micro score on CREMA-D, 82.7% accuracy on RAVDESS and the highest scores on MSP-IMPROV with 89.3%, 88.7% and 85.8% for valence, arousal and dominance.",

Numerous methods  [38, 43, 31, 22]  have been proposed to solve this task by using different data modalities, such as images, speech and text.

The most common methods are text-based [40,9,1] and image-based  [38, 43, 31] . For example for text,  [1]  present a BERT-based model to explore the importance of context extraction in texts for emotion recognition. One work by  [33]  proposed one sequence-based convolutional neural network to detect human emotion from big data. However, it is harder to to accurately predict human emotions from a text transcription compared to using richer modalities such as images or videos. For image data,  [31]  proposed feature decomposition and reconstruction learning for effective facial image expression recognition.  [27]  introduced the image depth information to improve the context information of images, which improved the representation capability and thus recognition accuracy. Moving to video,  [2]  introduced facial micro-expression analysis methods that can improve emotion recognition by capturing richer contextual sequence information than static images. Although unimodal emotion recognition has achieved substantial progress and delivers promising results, it is inherently limited by having less information available than multi-modal approaches.",

      "text": "Recently, multi-modal emotion recognition has become mainstream  [26, 7, 13, 17, 15, 16, 8, 14, 36]  due to its ability to fully exploit the complementary information present in different modalities. For instance,  [8]  explored the effectiveness of different variants of transformer-based inter-modal attention mechanisms for audio-video emotion recognition and showed that inter-modal interaction can significantly improve performance.  [25]  showed that combining audio and with a corresponding text transcription improves the representation ability of features, since audio captures details of intonation, while text captures semantics more explicitly. Moreover,  [7]  fused three modalities (audio, text and vision), further improving recognition accuracy. The above works indicate that combining multiple modalities can significantly enhance the discrimination ability of fused representations and thus the recognition performance. In this work, we study multimodal-based emotion recognition, specifically for audio-video emotion recognition (AVER). The most similar works to ours are  [16, 15] , both of which used a transformer-based architecture that is shared across video and audio modalities to encourage consistency of the multi-modal feature space. However, their proposed shared network cannot fully capture the unique feature distributions of each modality, such as explicit facial state changes between face video frames, resulting in the loss of information during the multimodal relationship modeling process. Unlike  [13, 14, 36] , which adopt attention-based neural network to effectively process and integrate audio modalities, our model not only learns the intra-relationships within video feature representations but also models the inter-relationships when attentively fuses the audio representation. Our proposed model augments video features with optical flow information before fusing with the audio features. Unlike traditional methods  [21]  that directly combine the optical flow features with visual representations, we use Conformer  [17]  networks to extract context-aware features, and design a novel pairwise O-V attention fusion module to combine them.",

Then, we employ the widely-used EfficientNet-B2 model  [32] , which has been fine-tuned on VGGface2  [5]  dataset, to extract representations for video frames and their corresponding optical flow maps; we denote these features by V = { v1 , v2 , . . . , vn } and Ȯ = { ȯ1 , ȯ2 , . . . , ȯn } respectively. To further enhance the representational ability of these visual features, we use two independent Conformer encoders  [17]  to embed them into the same dimensional space as the audio modality. This also allows for subsequent intermodal interaction. We next propose a simple and efficient pairwise O-V attention fusion module to combine the features of frames and optical flow into a joint embedding space. Specifically, we use a fully-connected (FC) layer to map the features at each time-point to two channels, then apply a softmax function  [6]  and interpret these values as weights for the frame and flow features respectively.\n\nWe finally obtain the detailed-enhanced video representation ov i by a weighted sum of linearly-projected frame features and corresponding flow features.

We want to allow the enhanced video frame features ov i to attend to features of relevant audio fragments Ā = {ā 1 , ā2 , . . . , ām }. Different from traditional selfattention  [37]  and cross-attention  [36] , we take the target video frame ov i as the query to calculate the attention weights, with the audio fragment defining the keys and values after the linear projections. Attentive fusion from another modality allows relevant modality information to be extracted and integrated, thereby improving the distinguishability of target modality representation. Finally, we obtain the video representations ÖV = { ö v i } after IFE by adding a residual connection, and passing through a feed-forward block (FFB) which contains two linear layers. In summary, we set\n\nwhere W ov , W a and Wa are linear projection parameters.

We adhered to the protocol in  [8, 13] , with 5 separate folds where each fold divides the data into training, validation, and test sets with non-overlapping actor identities. We evaluate based on the most commonly-used metrics for each dataset -F1-Macro and F1-Micro for CREMA-D  [4] , Accuracy for RAVDESS  [23]  and CCC for MSP-IMPROV  [3] .\n\nImplementation Details. All models were trained for up to 20 epochs using early stopping on the validation set, and we report our results on the test set. We choose hyper-parameters based on validation set performance. We use AdamW for optimization with a learning rate of 5 × 10 -6 and weight decay of 5 × 10 -2 . The face images are extracted from each frame of every video clip and resized to 224 × 224 pixels. We generate optical flow maps using  [20]  and normalize their magnitude by a standard deviation calculated from the local optical flow magnitude at every pixel position within an entire video clip. We use the pre-trained EfficientNet-B2 from  [32]  to extract features from the video frames and optical flow maps. The audio features are extracted using wav2vec2-large-robust  [18] . Separate Conformer encoders for video and audio map the extracted features to vectors of 1408-dimension each. Each Conformer block has a hidden dimensionality of 512, with 8 attention heads.

      "text": "In the IFE block, we define video attending to audio as V-cross and audio attending to video as A-cross. We first experiment with removing the IFE module (i.e. without any inter-modality fusion, only RGB images and flow maps, denoted None-IFE). In Table  2 , we see a large performance drop in this setting -compared with the best output (from IFE-Video), the F1-Macro and F1-Micro scores decrease by 3.7% and 5.1% on the CREMA-D test set, respectively. This suggests that intermodality fusion plays an important role in improving AVER capabilities. Recall that our model has three prediction heads: IFE-Audio (i.e. using features ä * ), Effects of Video Pairwise Attention Enhancement (PAE) Module. To demonstrate our ablations on pair-wise attention enhancement (PAE) Module, we categorize different settings as \"Fuse when?\", \"Visual input\", \"sequential model\", and \"Fuse how?\". Results on CREMA-D are given in Table  3 , all using the IFE-Video prediction head. We first present results when trained with only one part of the video information, i.e. RGB images only (IFE-V-F), or optical flow maps only (IFE-V-O). We see that IFE-V-O achieves 55.4% F1-macro and 64.9% F1-micro. The result shows optical flow information present low capability to distinguish emotions, and it is much weaker than using RGB images only. When combining optical flow maps with RGB images in the full model (IFE-Video), there is a remarkable performance improvement vs. IFE-V-F. It indicates that the flow maps indeed augment the video feature representations. Next, we replace our PAE with one single conformer followed by one OV-fusion block. To pass the image and optical flow features together into the conformer, we attempt several alternative operations-temporal concatenation (IFE-V-FOSC), channelwise concatenation (IFE-V-FODC), and summation (IFE-V-FODS). We see (Table  3 ) that our PAE module achieves the highest recognition performance, with 1.0% improvement over IFE-V-FOSC on F1-macro and 1.1% improvement over IFE-V-FODC on F1-Micro. These observations indicate that our PAE module is a more effective fusion method for combining visual features and optical flow features. Finally, we explore early fusion and late fusion strategies. We find that by moving OV-fusion block before the Conformer (IFE-V-Early), accuracy decreases slightly vs. having OV-fusion after the Conformer (IFE-Video), by 0.3% F1-Macro and 0.7% F1-Micro. We hypothesise that this is because the additional computation performed beforehand by the Conformer is beneficial in helping the OV-fusion module to determine whether to focus on image or flow information for each time-point. Additionally, we compare our method by replacing the conformer to the vanilla transformer  [37] , the accuracy decreases slightly by 1.6% and 1.1%, this demonstrates that the conformer is superior to the vanilla transformer at the image level in capturing changes in facial details from feature representations.\n\nEffects of optical-flow extraction variants. We next experiment with using different sliding window lengths and strides when extracting the optical flow from the videos. Firstly, we vary the window length while keeping the stride fixed to 1 (i.e. moving frame by frame). Secondly, we vary both the window length and the stride together (i.e. non-overlapping windows). The results in Table  4  show that using a window length of 1 with a stride of 1 performs best. Increased window lengths, with fixed or increasing strides, show consistent drops in performance, with the worst-performing variant having window length of 5 and stride of 1 (achieving 74.3% F1-Macro, versus 79.5% for window length and stride of 1). This indicates that temporally-fine-grained information is valuable in increasing the accuracy of emotion recognition. We also experiment with using a different backbone feature extractor for the optical flow, since face images and flow-maps are quite different domains. We choose DINOv2  [29] , which has been shown to be robust across many image domains, and fix the window length and stride to 1 (i.e. the best-performing setting). However, we find it performs worse than using EffcientNet pre-trained on a large face images dataset, dropping from 79.5% to 76.8% F1-Macro and from 83.7% to 82.6% F1-Micro.",
