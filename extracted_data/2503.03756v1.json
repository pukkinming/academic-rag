      "text": "Accurate speech emotion recognition is essential for developing human-facing systems. Recent advancements have included finetuning large, pretrained transformer models like Wav2Vec 2.0. However, the finetuning process requires substantial computational resources, including high-memory GPUs and significant processing time. As the demand for accurate emotion recognition continues to grow, efficient finetuning approaches are needed to reduce the computational burden. Our study focuses on dimensional emotion recognition, predicting attributes such as activation (calm to excited) and valence (negative to positive). We present various finetuning techniques, including full finetuning, partial finetuning of transformer layers, finetuning with mixed precision, partial finetuning with caching, and lowrank adaptation (LoRA) on the Wav2Vec 2.0 base model. We find that partial finetuning with mixed precision achieves performance comparable to full finetuning while increasing training speed by 67%. Caching intermediate representations further boosts efficiency, yielding an 88% speedup and a 71% reduction in learnable parameters. We recommend finetuning the final three transformer layers in mixed precision to balance performance and training efficiency, and adding intermediate representation caching for optimal speed with minimal performance trade-offs. These findings lower the barriers to finetuning speech emotion recognition systems, making accurate emotion recognition more accessible to a broader range of researchers and practitioners.",

      "text": "Speech emotion recognition plays a critical role in enabling systems to detect the emotional state of users. Recent advancements in speech emotion recognition have centered on the finetuning of pretrained transformer models  [1]  such as Wav2Vec 2.0  [2] . However, finetuning large models requires substantial computational resources, including significant memory and processing time, which are not easily available to many researchers and practitioners. As the demand for emotion recognition grows, there is an increasing need for more efficient finetuning approaches to reduce the computational burden.\n\nMost prior work in finetuning Wav2Vec 2.0 for dimensional speech emotion recognition, which focuses on predicting continuous emotion attributes such as activation (ranging from calm to active) and valence (ranging from negative to positive)  [3] -  [5] , sets the training batch size to at least 32  [1] ,  [6] . The combination of this batch size and the large parameter count of Wav2Vec 2.0 demands substantial GPU memory. Yet, a large batch size is essential because the standard loss function for dimensional emotion recognition is batch-dependent. Common GPUs such as the NVIDIA GTX 1080 Ti and RTX 2080 Ti yield \"out-of-memory\" errors when finetuning Wav2Vec 2.0 base with the standard training configurations. Therefore, finetuning even the base model is not possible without significant computational resources, limiting its use to practitioners with high-end GPUs. This highlights the critical need for exploration of efficient finetuning techniques that can maintain performance while alleviating the computational demands.\n\nIn this work, we present a comprehensive comparison of finetuning methods for Wav2Vec 2.0. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to systematically evaluate and compare partial finetuning of transformer layers, mixed precision training  [7] , caching intermediate representations, and LoRA (Low-Rank Adaptation)  [8]  within a single study for dimensional speech emotion recognition, offering guidelines on resource requirements to achieve state-of-the-art results. We find that partial finetuning of the Wav2Vec 2.0 base model achieves comparable performance to full finetuning, showing no statistically significant differences. Furthermore, we find that combining partial finetuning with mixed-precision training results in no significant difference compared to full finetuning with a 67% speedup. We combine this approach with caching to further speedup training by 88% over full finetuning. Notably, the partial finetuning approach can be executed on GPUs with lower memory, making it accessible to a wider range of researchers and practitioners.",

The dimensional emotion theory posits that emotion can be described by core attributes like valence (negative to positive) and activation (calm to active)  [3] ,  [4] .\n\nB. Wav2Vec 2.0 Wav2Vec 2.0 is a transformer-based model that learns contextualized representations from unlabeled raw audio data through self-supervised learning  [2] . It consists of a CNNbased feature encoder, transformer-based context network, and quantization module to discretize the feature encoder output, with a convolution layer before the transformer layers to learn positional embeddings  [2] . Wav2Vec 2.0 has been finetuned for tasks beyond automatic speech recognition, including speaker recognition  [9] ,  [10] , speaker verification  [11] ,  [12] , and speech emotion recognition  [1] ,  [12] -  [14] . Wav2Vec 2.0 embeddings have been shown to outperform traditional, non-deep-learning-based speech-emotion features  [13] , such as eGeMAPS  [15]  and spectograms. As a result, deep embeddings have become the foundation for many modern speech emotion recognition systems  [1] ,  [12] -  [14] .",

      "text": "Pretraining allows models to learn general knowledge, such as language and syntax, through a task-agnostic objective. Finetuning adjusts pretrained model parameters for specific tasks. However, finetuning Wav2Vec 2.0 base (95M parameters) is computationally expensive and often impractical on common GPUs due to the high memory demands of raw audio input. Understanding the roles of individual layers can provide a foundation for exploring efficient finetuning strategies.\n\nPasad et al. performed a layer-wise analysis of Wav2Vec 2.0, showing that the early transformer layers encode acoustics, middle layers capture phonetics, and upper layers focus on semantics  [16] . When finetuning Wav2Vec 2.0 base for automatic speech recognition, they found that the early layers remained highly correlated with the pretrained checkpoint, while the final 3 to 4 layers encoded task-specific information. This supports an analysis into partial, rather than full, finetuning.\n\nPrior work has explored modifications to the Wav2Vec 2.0 architecture to improve speed and performance in speech recognition  [17] . Additionally, prior work has explored the partial finetuning of Wav2Vec 2.0 by freezing the CNN feature encoder and finetuning only the transformer layers  [12] , as recommended by the Wav2Vec 2.0 authors  [2] . Wagner et al. found that freezing the transformer layers and training only the output heads resulted in a substantial decrease in emotion performance, indicating that finetuning the transformer layers is necessary for achieving state-of-the-art results  [1] . To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to examine the effect of partial finetuning within the transformer layers and, more generally, efficient training techniques, for dimensional speech emotion recognition. For the remainder of the paper, we freeze the CNN feature encoder and define \"partial finetuning\" as the selective freezing of transformer layers.\n\nMixed precision training  [7]  has become a common approach for efficiently finetuning large models. It involves storing weights, gradients, and activations in half-precision, but maintaining single-precision copies of weights to accumulate gradients. Previous work has combined mixed precision with other techniques to reduce GPU memory requirements for Wav2Vec 2.0 training in automatic speech recognition  [18] . To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to apply mixed precision training to dimensional speech emotion recognition.\n\nWe also explore the Parameter-Efficient Finetuning technique LoRA (low-rank approximation), which freezes all pretrained model weights and adds small rank decompositional matrices to model layers (typically attention layers) during training  [8] . Feng et al. found that LoRA finetuning was beneficial for categorical speech emotion classification  [19] . To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to explore LoRA finetuning for dimensional speech emotion recognition.",

Therefore, we do not compare gradient checkpointing, and instead investigate faster methods, such as caching intermediate model outputs from frozen layers during partial finetuning (Section IV-C).",

Thus, we must zero-pad the audio, which adds silence to the end of the raw waveforms so that all samples in a batch are equal in length.

      "text": "Due to the large number of parameters in Wav2Vec 2.0, the computation time is significant even when most layers are frozen. However, it is important to note that the output of frozen layers does not change for a given input audio sample. Therefore, we propose storing the model output from the frozen layers for a one-time cost. In this case, we exchange increased disk usage for decreased computation time and memory usage. Additionally, we must freeze the positional embedding layer in the caching approach since it occurs before transformer layers (Figure  1b ). This involves three steps: 1) process each audio sample individually (batch size = 1), creating and caching representations of that sample up to the final frozen layer (e.g., layer 9 in Figure  1b ), 2) when preparing to train the model, create batches by loading subsets of the cached representations, 3) train the system as in the non-caching setup. Like in the non-caching case, samples in a batch must be of the same length. But, in this case, we do not know the length in advance. Therefore, we create a special caching padding strategy. Instead of zero-padding an audio sample before it enters the model, we must zero-pad its cached representation. However, Wav2Vec 2.0 base processes zero-padding without an attention mask, meaning the model does not differentiate between padding and silence. This is not a problem when the data are processed from raw audio, but may introduce performance changes when the representations are zero-padded in the middle of a set of transformer layers. We investigate the effects of this on downstream performance by presenting both the efficiency of caching and the performance of the resulting systems.",

If so, we follow this analysis with t-tests across the non-caching experiments, using the Bonferroni correction. Next, we compare noncaching to caching experiments to assess whether caching significantly hampers emotion recognition performance.

However, it is significantly worse than non-caching in the three-layer partial finetune for activation in mixed precision (0.016 CCC decrease), and for valence in single precision (0.007 CCC decrease). This is likely due to the caching padding strategy, which has propagating effects as it is applied to subsequent trainable layers. The difference in performance could also result from using different GPUs (due to the different system configuration needs, A40 for non-caching and RTX 2080 Ti for caching).
