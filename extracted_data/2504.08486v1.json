      "text": "lectroencephalography (EEG) is the electrical manifestation of brain activities and contain neural information of the central nervous system (CNS)  [1] . It is commonly employed as source signal for the application of brain computer interface (BCI), which provides the possibility of directly controlling machines based on the human intentions decoded from neural signals  [2] . There are multiple types of EEG-based BCI paradigms, such as auditory attention decoding (AAD), motor imagery (MI), affective computation (AC), etc. AAD is a task which is designed to decode which voice the participant is listening from EEG signals in a multi-speaker condition  [3] . MI is to decode the type of the imagined movements from EEG signals  [4] . AC is to obtain the emotion of the participant from EEG signals  [5] . It is suggested that multiple types of information could be decoded from EEG signals. The EEG-based BCI is a practical noninvasive technology of restoring and augmenting the functions of the humans.\n\nThough promising, there were several challenges for practical use of EEG-based BCI system. One key challenge involves the automatic optimization of the number of the electrodes, or channels, placed on the scalp. For most current EEG tasks, tens of the electrodes are employed for achieving high decoding performance. However, excessive electrodes increased the complexity and decreased the portability of the system. As such, channel pruning, i.e., automatic minimization and optimization of the number of the electrodes, is crucial for the practical application of the system  [6] ,  [7] ,  [8] .\n\nThe optimal electrode placement is subject to the BCI paradigm, and the number of the electrodes required. Current EEG channel pruning approaches mainly include end-to-end deep learning (DL) algorithms, machine learning methods, and statistical techniques  [8] . Iteratively applying DL classifiers to eliminate channels with minimal contribution to the decoding performance for a specific task is the most direct approach for channel selection. Kashefi et al. applied shallow convolutional neural networks (CNNs) iteratively to perform channel selection for MI  [8] , while Mirkovic et al. set up an offline iterative process for channel selection in auditory attention tasks  [9] . In addition,  Xu et al.  proposed an end-to-end DL model based on a weighted residual structure to identify a subset of invariant channels relevant to auditory tasks at the group level  [10] . Sun et al. incorporated a channel selection module into an end-to-end MI decoding model  [11] . However, channel selection schemes that rely on iterative classifiers and training processes not only increase training and learning costs but also complicate physiological interpretation. Similar to iterative processes, Narayanan et al. employed a greedy algorithm to search for channels relevant to auditory attention  [12] . Moreover, some researchers have utilized the weights of intermediate layers in DL algorithms for channel selection, thereby reducing computational costs. Wang et al. used the 2norm of the spatial convolution layer weights to determine the MI classification contribution  [7] , Lin et al. considered attention scores as indicators of relevance for AC tasks  [13] , and Cai et al. attempted to quantify the importance of EEG channels for AAD tasks using graph attention weights  [14] . However, the weights of a given layer may not directly reflect the causal relationship between input and output and often exhibit poor stability. Therefore, some researchers have adopted machine learning or statistical methods that more directly capture causal relationships for channel selection. Wang et al.  [15]  selected four optimal channels using weight vectors derived from common spatial patterns (CSP), while Yong et al. further enhanced the sparsity of CSP weight vectors by introducing ℓ1-norm regularization  [16] ,  [17] . Li et al. selected channels by calculating the statistical significance of power spectral parameters in relation to the task  [18] , and Jing et al. proposed a correlation-based channel selection method  [19] ,  [20] . These methods typically rely on linear assumptions, which may fail to fully capture the complex nonlinear features present in EEG signals. Furthermore, all of the aforementioned methods are tailored to specific BCI paradigms, and their portability and effectiveness across different platforms remain uncertain.\n\nTo address these challenges, we propose plug-and-select (PlugSelect), a framework for channel selection based on outcome attribution designed for the EEG-based BCI paradigms. PlugSelect could work with different neural networks and requires no additional training costs, prior knowledge, or assumptions for channel selection. Specifically, it consists of two modules: integrated gradients (IG) and ranking strategy (RS). (  1 ) IG integrates the gradients along the input path to assess the global contribution of input channels to the prediction outcome, thereby providing a direct interpretation of the decision-making process in complex neural networks. This approach addresses the issue of traditional weight-based schemes' inability to stably capture the causal relationship between input and output, all while requiring no additional training costs. (2) RS, building upon the personalized channel selection scheme provided by IG, introduces a tasklevel channel ranking strategy aimed at addressing subject heterogeneity, thereby achieving a more stable and reliable subset of channels.\n\nIn addition, for verifying the plug-and-play functionality and broad effectiveness of the framework, three different types of EEG-based BCI paradigms were applied: 1) the new cuemasked AAD task, of which one is the two-class orientation attention (OA) decoding, and another is the two-class timbre attention (TA) decoding; 2) the traditional four-class MI task; 3) the three-class AC task. Using the PlugSelect framework, we then calculated the average classification contribution of each channel from the input multichannel EEG signal assessing its impact on prediction outcomes. And evaluated the model's performance under varying channel densities using metrics such as accuracy (ACC). Ultimately, we aimed to balance the number of channels, model decoding performance, and computational efficiency (number of samples processed per second) by selecting a task-relevant subset of channels. This provides guidance for designing more efficient, low-channel EEG caps suitable for different EEG-based BCI paradigms.\n\nIn conclusion, our main contributions are:  (1)  We propose PlugSelect as a plug-and-play systematic channel selection framework, which has been efficiently ported and validated across multiple data platforms (MI task and AC task). (  2 ) PlugSelect preserves decoding efficiency while significantly reducing redundant channels. (3) 15 AAD-related channels are identified, and the channel pruning results demonstrate a strong correlation with downstream task performance.",

      "text": "The proposed PlugSelect consists of two key modules: IG and RS, as shown in Fig.  1 . The IG is designed to estimate the contribution of each channel for the downstream BCI tasks. The RS is used to process the difference among the subjects to mitigate the effects of subject variability and make the results generalized. The details of the two modules are described as follows: a). IG For a specific BCI task, IG employs linear interpolation and gradient summation along the path between a reference baseline and the EEG data to measure the contribution of each channel. Its input is raw EEG data, denoted as 𝜑 ∈ ℝ !×# with the number of the channels as 𝐶 and the sample points in the 𝑠 $% decision window as 𝑇, and a pre-trained neural network model for the downstream BCI tasks with full channels, denoted as ∆ & . For the 𝑖 $% channel, the attribution 𝜙 ' ( at the 𝑠 $% decision window is calculated as follows:\n\nwhere 𝜑 ' ) is the reference baseline for the data of the 𝑖 $% channel 𝜑 ' ∈ ℝ 1×𝑇 with a zero-baseline in this study.\n\n𝑀 represents the number of steps in the Riemannian path integral. 𝒢 denotes the gradient integral over the path, which is defined as follows:\n\nwhere ℎ(•) denotes the mapping function of the pre-trained model ∆ 𝑥 , which is responsible for transforming the input 𝜌 % into a specific representation in the output space. 𝜌 % is a scaling variable at step 𝑚. IG employs an integral method to express the impact of each incremental change from the zerobaseline to the complete input on the output in a fine-grained manner, rather than merely focusing on the singular effect of the complete input on the model output. This makes it apply to the nonlinear model. Additionally, IG integrates the cumulative contribution along the entire path from the reference baseline to the actual input, providing guidance in the channel pruning process by retaining key channels and pruning redundant ones. Suppose there are 𝑛 decision windows for each subject, the contribution of the 𝑖 $% channel is the summation of the contributions across all the windows, which is calculated as follows:\n\nThe contribution value ranged from -1 to 1. If it is greater than zero, it indicates that the channel positively contributes to the identification of the downstream task. If it is less than zero, it indicates a negative contribution. The larger the absolute value of IG, the stronger the channel's influence on the model's classification.\n\nAlgorithm 1 shows the pseudo-code for the reasoning component of the proposed PlugSelect method.",

Each subject completed two sessions on separate days, with each session comprising 72 EEG trials for each of the four MI tasks, recorded at a sampling rate of 250 Hz. A total of 22 electrodes, placed according to the 10-20 system, were used: Fz, FC3, FC1, FCz, FC2, FC4, C5, C3, C1, Cz, C2, C4, C6, CP3, CP1, CPz, CP2, CP4, P1, Poz, Pz, and P2.

In this study, a 6th-order Chebyshev filter was employed to preserve task-relevant rhythms. However, the time-consuming nature of MI-EEG acquisition and the limited size of the dataset increase the risk of underfitting.

PlugSelect maintains a decoding efficiency similar to that of the full channel configuration when the channel density is greater than 65%, especially in the AAD task. When the number of channels is reduced from 32 to 15, TA decoding performance decreases by 2%, while OA performance decreases by less than 1%, and OA task performance remains more stable with a reduction in the number of channels.

Firstly, compared to the random selection strategy, the two proposed RSs exhibit more stable performance and enhanced reproducibility. And Tables I, II, III, and IV indicate that the performance difference between the averaging strategy, which incorporates statistical sharing, and the voting strategy, which emphasizes individual differences, is around 1%. This suggests that PlugSelect's attribution calculation is insensitive to different ordering strategies and exhibits stronger stability.

And emotion cognition results from integrated processing across various brain regions  [34] ,  [36] .\n\nMoreover, since the multi-attribute AAD task paradigm used in this study is less commonly discussed, we can only analyze the plausibility of the channels extracted by PlugSelect from the perspective of functional brain regions. In contrast, the MI and ER paradigms and datasets are well-established, and the channels identified by PlugSelect are consistent with findings reported in existing literature, which serves as an additional validation of the reasonableness of the AAD channel results.",

In addition, the proposed PlugSelect relies on an effective pre-trained decoding model. Channels identified solely based on model inference may be limited in scope, and validating the effectiveness of the subset of channels extracted by PlugSelect through the functional properties of brain regions may lack sufficient accuracy. In future studies, we will further explore unsupervised algorithms to overcome labeling constraints and comprehensively evaluate the subset of channels associated with BCI task from multiple physiological perspectives.",

PlugSelect requires no additional training and can directly infer and interpret channels that are highly correlated with cortical electrical activity patterns through model result attribution. It is also efficiently portable across multiple platforms, such as AAD, MI and AC, addressing the limitations of existing algorithms. Furthermore, PlugSelect enables automatic channel decoupling while preserving decoding performance, providing a subset of channels closely related to specific BCI tasks, supporting the development and application of portable wearable devices.",
