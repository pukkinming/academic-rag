      "text": "Emotional expressions are the behaviors that communicate our emotional state or attitude to others. They are expressed through verbal and non-verbal communication. Complex human behavior can be understood by studying physical features from multiple modalities; mainly facial, vocal and physical gestures. Recently, spontaneous multi-modal emotion recognition has been extensively studied for human behavior analysis. In this paper, we propose a new deep learning-based approach for audio-visual emotion recognition. Our approach leverages recent advances in deep learning like knowledge distillation and high-performing deep architectures. The deep feature representations of the audio and visual modalities are fused based on a model-level fusion strategy. A recurrent neural network is then used to capture the temporal dynamics. Our proposed approach substantially outperforms state-of-the-art approaches in predicting valence on the RECOLA dataset. Moreover, our proposed visual facial expression feature extraction network outperforms state-of-the-art results on the AffectNet and Google Facial Expression Comparison datasets.",

      "text": "Darwin concluded through his observations and descriptions of human emotional expressions that emotions adapt to evolution, are biologically innate, and universal across all human and even non-human primates  (Matsumoto [2001] ). Formal, systematic research studies have since been realized on the universality of emotions. This work demonstrated: (i) the universality of six basic emotions (anger, disgust, fear, happiness, sadness and surprise) and (ii) the cultural differences in spontaneous emotional expressions  (Ekman et al. [1987] ).\n\nA human's emotion resulting from an interaction with stimuli is referred to as an affect. In psychology, an affect refers to the mental counterparts of internal bodily representations associated with emotions. In fact, humans express affect through facial, vocal or gestural behaviors. The notion of affect is subjective, and in the literature it is represented by two alternative views: the categorical view where affects are represented as discrete states with a wide variety of affective displays and the dimensional view, where we suppose that affects might not be culturally universal and alternatively, should be represented in a continuous arousal-valence space.\n\nRecently, a trend in the scientific community has emerged towards developing new technologies for processing, interpreting or simulating human emotions through Affective Computing or through Artificial Emotional Intelligence. Consequently, a broad range of applications have been developed in Human-Computer Interaction, health informatics and assistive technologies. Initial research on affect recognition focused mainly on unimodal approaches, with speech emotion recognition (SER) and facial expression recognition (FER)  (Rouast et al. [2019] ) treated as separate problems. More recently however, work in affective computing has paid more attention to multimodal emotion recognition by developing approaches to multimodal data fusion.\n\nResearch on affect recognition has seen considerable progress as the focus has shifted from the study of laboratorycontrolled databases to databases covering real-world scenarios. In traditional emotion recognition databases, subjects posed a particular basic emotion in laboratory-controlled conditions. In more recent databases, videos are obtained from reallife scenarios with in-the-wild environmental conditions and less constrained settings, which exhibit characteristics like illumination variation, noise, occlusion, non-frontal head poses, and so on. Today, automatic emotion recognition of the six basic emotions in acted visual and/or audio expressions can be performed with high accuracy. However, in-the-wild emotion recognition is a more challenging problem due to the fact that spontaneously occurring behavior varies more widely in its audio profile, visual aspects, and timing.\n\nIn the present era, deep learning-based approaches are revolutionizing many areas of technology. Automatic emotion recognition likewise can benefit from the effectiveness of deep learning. In this paper, we propose a new approach for audiovisual emotion recognition (AVER). This approach is based on pre-training separate audio and visual deep convolutional neural network (CNN) recognition modules. A fusion module is then trained on the specific audio-visual dataset of interest. The fusion module is trained with the combination of generic emotion recognition features extracted by our pre-trained audio and visual components. The remainder of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 reviews the literature on AVER and presents the contributions of our paper. Section 3 describes the proposed approach. Section 4 presents the experiments then reports and discusses the results. Finally, Section 5 concludes the paper and suggests future work.",

      "text": "Multimodal fusion for emotion recognition concerns the family of machine learning approaches that integrate information from multiple modalities in order to predict an outcome measure. Such is usually either a class with a discrete value (e.g., happy vs. sad), or a continuous value (e.g., the level of arousal/valence). Several literature review papers survey existing approaches for multimodal emotion recognition  (Rouast et al. [2019] ;  Baltrušaitis et al. [2018] ;  Zeng et al. [2008] ;  Poria et al. [2017] ). There are three key aspects to any multimodal fusion approach: (i) which features to extract, (ii) how to fuse the features, and (iii) how to capture the temporal dynamics. Extracted features: several handcrafted features have been designed for AVER. These low-level descriptors concern mainly geometric features like facial landmarks. Meanwhile, commonly-used audio signal features include spectral, cepstral, prosodic, and voice quality features. Recently, deep neural network-based features have become more popular for AVER. These deep learning-based approaches fall into two main categories. In the first, several handcrafted features are extracted from the video and audio signals and then fed to the deep neural network  (Ringeval et al. [2015] ;  He et al. [2015] ;  Othmani et al. [2019] ;  Rejaibi et al. [2019] ;  Muzammel et al. [2020] ). In the second category, raw visual and audio signals are fed to the deep network  (Tzarakis et al. [2017] ;  Tzirakis et al. [2018] ;  Basnet et al. [2019] ). Deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have been observed as outperforming other AVER methods  (Rouast et al. [2019] ). Multimodal features fusion: An important consideration in multimodal emotion recognition concerns the way in which the audio and visual features are fused together. Four types of strategy are reported in the literature: feature-level fusion, decisionlevel fusion, hybrid fusion and model-level fusion  (Zhang et al. [2017] ;  Poria et al. [2017] ). Feature-level fusion also called early-fusion concerns approaches where features are immediately integrated after extraction via simple concatenation into a single highdimensional feature vector. Such is the most common strategy for multimodal emotion recognition. Decision-level fusion or late fusion concerns approaches that perform fusion after an independent prediction is made by a separate model for each modality. In the audio-visual case, this typically means taking the predictions from an audio-only model, and the prediction from a visual-only model, and applying an algebraic combination rule of the multiple predicted class labels such as 'min', 'sum', and so on. Score-level fusion is a subfamily of the decision-level family that employs an equally weighted summation of the individual unimodal predictors. Hybrid fusion combines outputs from early fusion and from individual classification scores of each modality. Model-level fusion aims to learn a joint representation of the multiple input modalities by first concatenating the input feature representations, and then passing these through a model that computes a learned, internal representation prior to making its prediction. In this family of approaches, multiple kernel learning  (Chen et al. [2014] ), and graphical models  (Baltrušaitis et al. [2018 (Baltrušaitis et al. [ , 2013]] ) have been studied, in addition to neural network-based approaches. Modelling temporal dynamics: audio-visual data represents a dynamic set of signals across both spatial and temporal dimensions.  Rouast et al. [2019]  identify three distinct methods by which deep learning is typically used to model these signals: Spatial feature representations: concerns learning features from individual images or very short image sequences, or from short periods of audio. Temporal feature representations: where sequences of audio or image inputs serve as the model's input. It has been demonstrated that deep neural networks and especially recurrent neural networks are capable of capturing the temporal dynamics of such sequences  (Kim et al. [2017] ). Joint feature representations: in these approaches, the features from unimodal approaches are combined. Once features are extracted from multiple modalities at multiple time points, they are fused using one of strategies of modality fusion  (Ringeval et al. [2015] ).",

The proposed model is a fusion of two deep neural networks: (i) a deep CNN model, trained with knowledge distillation, for FER and (ii) a modified and fine-tuned VGGish model for SER. A model-level fusion based approach is employed to fuse the audio and the visual feature representations. To model the temporal dynamics, the spatial and temporal representations are processed using recurrent neural networks. The contributions of this work can be summarized as follows:\n\n• A new high-performing deep neural network-based approach for AudioVisual Emotion Recognition (AVER)\n\n• Learning two independent feature extractors -one for audio and one for face images -that are specialised for emotion recognition, and that could be employed for any downstream audiovisual emotion recognition task or dataset\n\n• Applying knowledge distillation (specifically, selfdistillation), alongside additional unlabeled data for FER\n\n• Learning the spatio-temporal dynamics via a recurrent neural network for AVER.",

The input to this network is a single RGB face image, detected and cropped using Multi-Task Cascaded Convolutional Networks (MTCNN)  (Zhang et al. [2016] ). The output of this network is a compact vector of dimension D face .\n\nWe refer to this network as our 'facial expression embedding network', and we train it using knowledge distillation  (Hinton et al. [2014] ). Knowledge distillation is a two step process whereby a teacher network is trained on the task of interest, and then a (typically smaller) student network is trained on predictions made by the teacher. Specifically in this work, we leverage the benefits of self-distillation, whereby the student network has the same size as (or at least, is not smaller than) the teacher network. Self-distillation was recently leveraged to achieve state-of-the-art results on the well-known Imagenet classification dataset  (Xie et al. [2020] ). It has also been shown theoretically that self-distillation can improve a model's performance via a regularization effect  (Mobahi et al. [2020] ). We use self-distillation to improve the performance of our facial expression embedding network. The training procedure for this network thus consists of two phases:\n\n1. Training a teacher model: our teacher model is a finetuned FaceNet  (Schroff et al. [2015] ), trained simultaneously on two different visual facial expression recognition datasets (Section 3.1.1). 2. Training a student model: a second CNN is additionally trained to mimic the outputs of this fine-tuned FaceNet (Section 3.1.2).",

      "text": "The starting point for our teacher model is a pre-trained FaceNet  (Schroff et al. [2015] ). This model is then trained to learn specialised features for facial emotion recognition using two datasets:\n\n• AffectNet  (Mollahosseini et al. [2019] ), which consists of around 440,000 in-the-wild face crop images, each of which is human-annotated into one of eight facial expression categories (Neutral, Happy, Sad, Surprise, Fear, Disgust, Anger and Contempt).\n\n• Google Facial Expression Comparison (FEC) (Agarwala and Vemulapalli  [2019] ), which consists of around 700,000 triplets of unique face crop images. Annotations denoting the most similar pair of face expressions in each triplet are provided. The goal is to train a model that places the similar pair closer together in a learned embedding space.\n\nOur teacher model's architecture (Fig.  1 ) is almost identical to the model proposed in  Agarwala and Vemulapalli [2019] , the only difference is that we add an additional output head for the AffectNet loss. A pre-trained FaceNet 1  is taken up until the Inception 4e block. This is followed by a 1x1 convolution and a series of five untrained DenseNet  (Huang et al. [2017] ) blocks. After this, another 1x1 convolution followed by global average pooling reduces this representation to a single D face dimensional vector. After pooling, two independent linear transformations serve as output heads. These heads take the D facedimensional facial expression representation vector as input and make separate predictions for the AffectNet and FEC tasks. A 32-dimensional embedding is used for the FEC triplets task, while an 8-dimensional output head produces class logits for AffectNet (which has 8 classes). The teacher network training procedure is detailed in Algorithm 1, while implementation details are provided in the supplementary materials.\n\nTo improve the regularization effects of self-distillation through model ensembling, we in fact train two teacher networks, and concatenate their outputs to serve as distillation targets (see Section 3.1.2 for details). The only difference between the two teachers are the random seeds used for initialization, and penultimate layer dimensionalities: we use D face = 128 for one teacher network, and D face = 256 for the other.",

The Pow-derFaces dataset was created by downloading approximately 20,000 short, publicly-available videos from various online sources such as YouTube. To increase the frequency of faces in the dataset, specific search terms and topics were used when searching for videos, such as 'podcast', 'interview', or 'monologue'. MTCNN face detection was then applied to the extracted frames from those videos, producing approximately 1 million individual face crops. The sampled batches of face crops from the Google FEC, AffectNet, and Powder-Faces datasets are passed through our two teacher networks. Each of the two teacher networks produces predictions for the Google FEC task (32-dimensional) and AffectNet class logits  The audio and the visual embedding vectors are each fed to a small, independent convolutional network. This results in one tensor of size (9, 64) for each modality. We concatenate these two to give a tensor of size (9, 128), which is fed to a two-layer LSTM network with dimensionality of 256. Taking the final time step's output of this LSTM gives a single vector of size 256, which is pass through a single fully-connected layer with two outputs, which after a tanh activation gives our predictions between -1 and 1 for arousal and valance.\n\n(8-dimensional). These four vectors (i.e., two vectors from two teacher networks) are individually L2-normalized The four normalized vectors are then concatenated, producing one long vector of dimension 80. A knowledge distillation loss (we specifically use 'Relational Knowledge Distillation'  (Park et al. [2019] ) for our loss function) is then calculated by comparing the output of a third output head in the student network to this 80-dimensional target vector. This knowledge distillation loss is then added to the standard AffectNet and Google FEC losses, which are calculated as per the teacher network training procedure.

Then, the short-time Fourier transform (STFT) is performed to create windows with length (l) of 40 milliseconds and a hop length of 40 milliseconds. To create the latter windows, a set of 128 Mel filters (M f ) are applied with a Mel frequency range of 125-7500 Hz. Finally, for each audio file, a tensor of shape [R, l, M f ] is generated to create a compatible pre-processed data input for the VGGish backbone network.\n\nAlgorithm   (Hershey et al. [2017] ). Our starting point is the original VGGish model, pre-trained on the Audio Set dataset  (Gemmeke et al. [2017] ). The VGGish backbone consists of 6 convolutional layers that output 64, 128, 256, and 512 feature maps ( f ) respectively. For each convolution layer, a kernel (k) with size 3x3, and stride (s) of 1x1 is used. A max pooling layer with a kernel (k) of size 2x2, and stride (s) 2x2 is then applied. We take this VGGish backbone, but replace its last convolution and max pooling layers with a global average pooling layer. The resulting model produces an output vector of dimension 256. After this, we add three randomly-initialized, fully-connected layers, with output dimensionalities of 4096, 4096, and 128. These layer sizes were chosen to mimic the fully-connected penultimate layers of the original VGGish architecture. The aim of these layers is to extract a standard embedding vector with size of 128 that reflects the emotional characteristics of the input audio segment.\n\nWe take this expanded VGGish backbone architecture and fine-tune it end-to-end on the RECOLA dataset. Two separate VGGish networks are fine-tuned: one to predict arousal and the other to predict valence. We pass inputs of size  [480, 128]  to the VGGish model, which are the mel-spectrogram representations of 30 seconds of audio from one of the videos in the RECOLA dataset. The target used for fine tuning is then the average ground truth arousal or valence for the target values corresponding to the input 30 seconds of audio. We predict this target by passing the 128-dimensional audio representation through a fully-connected layer f φ with a tanh activation. The training procedure for fine tuning our audio feature extraction model is detailed in Algorithm 2.\n\nAlgorithm 2: VGGish fine-tuning algorithm for predicting arousal.

This ran contrary to our expectations: we expected unlabeled data to help in this context, given a similar approach achieved state-of-the-art results on Imagenet  (Xie et al. [2020] ). In that work however, the unlabeled dataset consisted of 300 million images -300 times more than the Imagenet dataset itself. In our case, our unlabeled dataset of one million images is only about twice the size of the number of faces in AffectNet and Google FEC combined. Thus, to truly conclude whether the benefits of unlabeled data as shown on Imagenet transfer well to facial expressions, many more unlabeled images are needed. We plan to address this point in future work.\n\nOn the other hand, it appears that self-distillation is indeed beneficial in the facial expressions domain. This is illustrated by the marked improvement in our accuracy on the Google FEC dataset when distillation is applied, compared to training without distillation. For AffectNet, the benefits of distillation are less pronounced, and it seems that the combination of using a pre-trained FaceNet model, plus training on Google FEC at the same time as AffectNet are all necessary components to achieving our results.\n\nFinally, our results for valence on the RECOLA test set show a dramatic improvement over existing state-of-the-art approaches (Table  5 ).
