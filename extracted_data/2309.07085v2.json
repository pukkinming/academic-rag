      "text": "Federated learning is emerging as a privacy-preserving model training approach in distributed edge applications. As such, most edge deployments are heterogeneous in nature, i.e., their sensing capabilities and environments vary across deployments. This edge heterogeneity violates the independence and identical distribution (IID) property of local data across clients. It produces biased global models, i.e., models that contribute to unfair decision-making and discrimination against a particular community or a group. Existing bias mitigation techniques only focus on bias generated from label heterogeneity in non-IID data without accounting for domain variations due to feature heterogeneity. Our work proposes a group-fair FL framework that minimizes group-bias while preserving privacy. Our main idea is to leverage average conditional probabilities to compute a cross-domain group importance weights derived from heterogeneous training data to optimize the performance of the worst-performing group using a modified multiplicative weights update method. Additionally, we propose regularization techniques to minimize the difference between the worst and best-performing groups while ensuring through our thresholding mechanism to strike a balance between bias reduction and group performance degradation. Our evaluation of image classification benchmarks assesses the fair decision-making of our framework in real-world settings.

      "text": "Federated learning (FL) is a privacy-preserving machine learning (ML) technique wherein local models are trained on decentralized edge devices (clients) and subsequently aggregated at the server to form a global model. This approach alleviates the need for raw data transfers and ensures data privacy, making it particularly well-suited for applications with privacy sensitivities, such as medical diagnosis  [21, 38, 59] , next-character prediction  [67] , activity recognition  [17, 56, 66] , and human emotion recognition  [14, 46, 72] , where preserving data security is imperative. Despite its merits, there is a growing concern regarding FL models, as they exhibit exceptional performance for certain groups while simultaneously underperforming for others (e.g., providing accurate image captioning for pristine group images than noisy group images as shown in Figure  1 ). A group categorizes data based on attributes such as race, gender, class, or label  [7] .\n\nGroup biases and discriminatory practices threaten societal well-being, undermining public confidence in ML models and their applications  [7] . Research shows racial bias in electronic health records, especially in medical analysis, potentially causing treatment disparities for minority groups  [68] . Biased models often result from label heterogeneity in non-IID data across clients, as discussed in works like  [52, 57] , arising from diverse label distributions tied to data collection device environments. For example, certain geo-regions may have varying label distributions, reducing training data volume for specific groups  [8, 30] .\n\nOur work highlights feature noise heterogeneity as a significant source of group bias in FL models, stemming from varied noise-influenced features due to domain differences, especially in heterogeneous devices  [48] . Heterogeneity leads to distinct feature distributions in local client data. For example, low-quality sensors on some devices introduce distortion like Gaussian noise, resulting in different feature distributions compared to high-quality sensor devices  [47] . This inherent feature noise causes shifts in group data moments, which are statistical properties such as mean and variance within a group in a dataset  [35] , influencing biased model outcomes. female dressed as a princess in a white dress male wearing a half sleeve t-shirt and a chef apron female dressed as a bride in a white dress male wearing a half sleeve t-shirt and a vest\n\nFeature heterogeneity is due to environmental or device-specific factors such as low resources.\n\nFigure  1 . Illustrating the adverse effects of feature heterogeneity (noise) and its bias impact on image classification data  [42]  on an example language model (LM) in FL settings. The global LM, engaging in image captioning based on features from multiple clients, shows higher performance for images without distortions compared to those with a shift in feature distributions. This emphasizes the intricate interplay of feature heterogeneity and bias in FL, highlighting the influence of heterogeneous client datasets on the model's outcome.\n\nPrevious FL research introduces Disparate Learning Processes (DLPs) to tackle bias and fairness issues. Examples of DLPs include in-processing methods like  [9, 11, 12, 15, 16, 18, 23, 31, 43, 44, 52, 57, 61, 73, 74, 76]  and Robustness and generalization strategies such as  [34, 41] . In-processing techniques modify learning to include group fairness constraints, while robustness and generalization enhance model resilience in diverse data settings. However, DLPs don't ensure fairness in settings with feature heterogeneity, especially due to feature noise, as they don't address misaligned moments in feature distributions  [35] . For DLPs that use \"reweighting\" with importance weights to adjust the model's objective function, their effectiveness relies on suitable importance weight selection  [6] . Importance weights prioritize specific groups or features during training to mitigate biases and enhance fairness  [6] . If not chosen carefully or not aligned with genuine sources of bias, these weights can lead to continued unfairness  [6] . We propose using weights derived from noisy feature data for more efficient debiasing in FL models affected by feature noise. This work introduces learnable importance weights from heterogeneous data features to enhance fairness in training, utilizing the multiplicative weight update (MW) method  [3]  for better fairness based on feature characteristics, especially considering data characteristics with feature noise. Our approach is inspired by insights from social science, particularly addressing discrimination as a health disparity determinant  [36] . By incorporating learnable importance weights, we aim to mitigate biases across demographic groups, contributing to a more equitable FL framework.\n\nThe efficacy of importance weighting diminishes due to exploding weight norms from the empirical risk scaling with importance weights, especially in large models, risking overfitting  [6] . To tackle this, we propose using neural network regularization techniques  [55]  in Multiplicative Weight update with Regularization (MWR) to mitigate group bias. Additionally, methods using importance weighting may introduce unfairness by overly emphasizing poorly-performing groups, potentially reducing the performance of better-performing groups to minimize overall variability  [13] . To address this issue, we present a heuristic approach for deriving importance weights that mitigate group bias while maintaining a performance threshold for better-performing groups, preventing their performance from dropping below a desirable level. We summarize our contributions below: We ensure that MWR optimizes the performance of the worstperforming group while also keeping the performance of the best-performing group above a desirable threshold. • Implementation and Evaluation: We implement and evaluate the MWR method against existing bias-mitigation techniques on commonly used state-of-the-art image classification FL benchmark datasets (CIFAR10  [37] , MNIST  [40] ,\n\nFashionMNIST  [71] , USPS  [32] , SynthDigits  [24] , and MNIST-M  [24] ). Our findings show that MWR outperforms baseline methods, boosting the accuracy of the worst group's performance up to 41% without substantially degrading the best group's performance.\n\n2 Background and Related Work 2.1 Bias in Machine Learning. Bias in ML refers to a model favoring specific individuals or groups, leading to unfair outcomes  [51] . Common sources of bias in centralized learning include prejudice, underestimation, and negative legacy  [1, 8, 49] . Techniques such as preprocessing, in-processing, and post-processing  [22, 26, 33]  have effectively mitigated centralized learning bias. However, applying centralized learning techniques in FL is challenging due to privacy concerns, requiring access to features across clients and risking data privacy compromise.",

The choice of TPR as a performance metric of in assessing group group fairness aligns our approach with recent advancements in bias mitigation literature  [58] . This decision stems from recognizing the critical importance of fairly detecting true positives, which cannot be addressed solely by relying on accuracy.\n\nWhile our primary focus is on achieving fairness with a minimax property (optimizing WTPR outcome within each group), we evaluate using various fairness metrics to ensure versatility and broad support.",

      "text": "The bias mitigation work falls mainly into four categories, including: 1) Client-fairness techniques  [12, 31, 43, 44, 52, 61] ,\n\n2) Group-fairness techniques  [9, 11, 15, 16, 18, 23, 57, 73, 74, 76] , 3) Collaborative Fairness techniques  [19, 48, 54, 75] , and 4) Robustness and Generalization techniques  [34, 41, 60] .\n\nClient fairness targets the development of algorithms leading to models that exhibit similar performance across different clients  [44] . On the other hand, group fairness requires the model to perform similarly on different demographic groups  [73] . Many state-of-the-art fairness techniques in FL, focusing on client fairness and group fairness, use inprocessing methods to modify the learning process or objective function by incorporating fairness constraints  [73] .\n\nIn-processing involves assigning weights to the objective function from different clients or groups during training to balance the influence of the model on different groups or clients. For instance, AFL  [52]  optimizes the combination of worst-weighted losses from local clients, proving resilient to data with an unknown distribution. q-FFL  [44]  reweights loss functions to give higher weights to devices with poorer performance, addressing challenges in fair resource allocation in computer networks. TERM handles outliers and class imbalance by tilting the loss function with a designated tilting factor  [43] . GIFAIR-FL  [73]     [48] . It is important to note that while we discuss Collaborative Fairness, here does not specifically address mitigating group bias in FL, as these techniques do not inherently focus on improving group performances.\n\nRobustness and Generalization techniques address distributional shifts in user data. For instance, FedRobust  [60]  trains a model to handle worst-case affine shifts, assuming that each client can express its data distribution as an affine transformation of a global distribution, focusing on group fairness. However, FedRobust requires sufficient data for each client to estimate the local worst-case shift, impacting global model performance when this condition is unmet. Fed-NTD tackles catastrophic forgetting distillation  [29]  but may not fully handle bias from feature noise. SCAFFOLD  [34]  addresses client drift in heterogeneous data by estimating update directions. However, SCAFFOLD may not correct moments in noisy feature distributions. In contrast, we use importance weights from noisy features to prioritize disadvantaged groups during training, enhancing fairness by indirectly correcting misaligned moments.",

We employ the ResNet model  [28]  for CIFAR10  [37]  image classification and a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) on the DIGITS classification dataset, which comprises data from diverse sources with feature shifts. The goal is to replicate real-world FL scenarios with varied client data. We construct the DIGITS dataset by combining data from SynthDigits  [24] , MNIST-M  [24] , and MNIST  [4] .\n\nWe select these datasets to compare group-bias with existing bias mitigation techniques in FL. Each dataset is evenly distributed among 𝐾 clients in the FL framework, ensuring equal allocation of group data points. Clients utilize replicated versions of the original benchmark test set, aligning noise feature distributions between training and test data.\n\nWe set all model parameters to match FL parameters for global model convergence under IID data settings, including label and feature noise homogeneity. Client settings include a mini-batch size of 128, a learning rate of 0.01, and 40 (for CIFAR10) and 12 (for DIGITS) training rounds. Heterogeneous Feature Distributions. We add noise to mimic real-world distorted images that fail to share the same feature distribution with the pristine training images  [25, 62, 64] . In particular, we add Gaussian noise with a variance greater than or equal to 0.03, consistent with the real-world deployments  [48] . We create two different distortion levels in each dataset across 𝐾 clients. For the CIFAR10, three advantaged clients (A, B, C) lack distortions, while the other two disadvantaged clients (D, E) host data with Gaussian noise of variance 𝑣𝑎𝑟 ∈ {0.03, 0.07, 0.11, 0.3, 0.4, 0.8, 1.0}.

The global model's recognition of local groups varies per client, as seen in the discrepancy between their performances. Increasing Gaussian noise on a client amplifies this difference, indicating that heterogeneous local features across clients contribute to group bias. Limitation of Federated Averaging. We empirically investigate how heterogeneous local data distributions affect local model gradients. Post-convergence, we extract gradients from the last linear layer of each local model across two clients. Figure  3  shows histograms of these gradients, highlighting variations across clients with heterogeneous features (3b) compared to more consistent distributions in clients with homogeneous features (3a).

Calculating these weights is straightforward in centralized learning  [20] , where a global data view is available. However, In FL, lacking this global view is not trivial. We must estimate 𝑤 𝑔 𝑗 while safeguarding client data privacy. Our solution addresses this by approximating the denominator of 𝑤 𝑔 𝑗 (𝑝 (G = 𝑔 𝑗 |X)) through a process involving a mixture of group likelihoods across clients. Suppose G = 1, ..., 𝑗 represents groups across clients in FL. Each client 𝑐 𝑘 employs a multiclass logistic linear regression probabilistic model  [2]  to predict the likelihood of an input sample x 𝑖,𝑘 belonging to a specific group 𝑔 𝑗 .

Algorithm 1 details the workings of the MW algorithm. We assign each client with groups and a set of |G| classes for the underlying application during the local learning process. The optimization constraints comprise decisions made by both the local and global models for groups assigned to clients, ensuring fairness in group classification. Using image features in the training dataset, we validate constraint satisfaction in each local training iteration and identify suitable groups. We then associate decisions made by each local model with a group empirical risk that quantifies how well a decision made by the local model satisfies the constraints. Over time, we minimize the overall risk of the global model by ensuring that each local model incurs a low per-group risk. This involves tracking the global weight for each group and randomly selecting groups with a probability proportional to their importance weights 𝑤 𝑔 𝑗 . In each iteration, we update 𝑤 𝑔 𝑗 using the MW algorithm, multiplying their numerator 𝑞(G = 𝑔 𝑗 |G) with factors dependent on the risk of the associated group decision.

We assess the efficacy of MWR's group-bias mitigation through: (i) evaluating the best-and worst-group performance (TPR), (ii) analyzing the TPR group variance per client, and (iii) examining the TPR discrepancy per client. This evaluation is conducted on four datasets, incorporating low-grade distortion to simulate prevalent real-world heterogeneity  [30] . Table1 presents the TPR, TPRSD, WTPR, and BTPR perfromance scores across various bias mitigation techniques and datasets. Notably, among these techniques, MWR stands out by achieving a significantly fairer outcomes for groups. We can see that our algorithm substantially decreases TPRSD across most clients while maintaining a consistently high TPR. Importance weighting, especially when derived from features characteristics, is powerful in mitigating biases caused by feature noise. If the bias is primarily driven by certain features, assigning appropriate weights to these features can help the model focus on relevant information and reduce the impact of noisy features, resulting in more consistent and equitable predictions.\n\nAlthough AFL and FedNTD occasionally outperform MWR in some instances concerning the TPRSD metric as can be seen in DIGITS dataset's client4 and MNIST dataset's clients4 and 5, the differences between the results are marginal. Importance weighting is sensitive to distribution shifts in the feature space. If there are instances where the distribution shifts significantly, the importance weights may not be as effective. On the other hand, techniques such as FedNTD, through knowledge distillation, seem to be more robust to feature noise as it involves transferring knowledge from a more complex model (teacher) to a simpler one (student), potentially leading to better generalization and lower standard deviation in true positive rates across groups. Additionally, it becomes evident from Table  1  that MWR results in an increased WTPR for the group with the smallest TPR, accompanied by the smallest TPRD among the evaluated bias mitigation techniques.\n\nImportance weights derived from image features captures the distinctive characteristics of different groups more effectively than other methods. This adaptability is crucial in mitigating bias since it tailors the mitigation strategy to the specific features and challenges present in each group. Despite TERM appearing to outperform our proposed method for the minimax group fairness metric (WTPR) in CIFAR10 dataset's clients 1, 2, and 3, this can be understood as a consequence of the reduction in TPR among privileged clients lacking local data with distortions. This reduction elevates the lower TPR among disadvantaged clients affected by distortions Importantly, the differences between the results are marginal, indicating a closely competitive performance between the methods despite this disparity while elevating the group-fairness among clients. Takeaway: MWR ensures fairness across groups and maintains predictive accuracy by using importance weights that prioritize the worst-performing groups. Its key strength lies in maintaining fairness without sacrificing performance, achieved through even distribution of importance weights among different groups.",

Model performance evaluation used the same fairness metrics as before.

This enhancement in WTPR for disadvantaged groups minimally affects high-performing groups' performance.\n\nAlthough some bias mitigation techniques may slightly outperform in TPRSD and WTPR fairness metrics, this often occurs at the expense of decreased TPR in privileged clients not affected by distortions. However, this decrease compensates for an increase in lower TPR among disadvantaged clients. Despite these differences, the results remain closely competitive among methods, indicating similar performance despite disparity, while simultaneously improving group fairness among clients.\n\nTakeaway. our robustness analysis suggests that MWR stands out as a robust and fair approach even in scenarios with highgrade heterogeneity, showcasing its effectiveness in mitigating bias across diverse datasets and client groups.",

      "text": "This section explores how differential privacy affects group fairness and performance in MWR, particularly in scenarios where local group probability distributions 𝑝 (G = 𝑔 𝑖 |x 𝑖,𝑘 ) are shared with the server to compute importance weights. Differential privacy is crucial for preserving privacy in client metadata, preventing disclosure of sensitive details like group selection probabilities.  We use the MNIST and FashionMNIST datasets for our privacy budget analysis, maintaining consistency in experimental setups and various learning components as detailed in §3.1. We introduce different levels of Laplace noise, denoted by 𝜖, to local probability distributions. An 𝜖 value of 0.00 represents perfect differential privacy in the implementation of MWR.\n\nFigures 5 to 8 show the impact of varying levels of Laplace noise (𝜖) on group-fairness metrics (WTPR, TPRSD, and TPRD) and group performance (TPR) in MWR, addressing bias in local data with different levels of feature noise. In Figures  5a to 7b , we see that using a privacy budget (𝜖 ∈ 0.0, 0.4, 0.8) for metadata exchange maintains fairness metrics similar to deploying MWR without privacy (𝜖 -→ ∞) on MNIST and FashionMNIST. This is evident from minimal variations in WTPR, TPRSD, and TPRD across all clients (with high and low feature heterogeneity) under all privacy budgets. Moreover, the privacy budget ensures fairness while preserving the best and worst TPR performance. This aligns with the fairness guarantee of MWR, as the privacy budget values (𝜖 ∈ 0.0, 0.4, 0.8) fall within a range that provides algorithmic fairness, as noted in  [1] . Our privacy analysis underscores that our method ensures client privacy through differential privacy on shared metadata without significantly affecting bias or accuracy. Takeaway. MWR demonstrates the feasibility of preserving sensitive information while effectively reducing group bias.",

Conversely, lower 𝜂 𝜇 values result in more gradual adjustments, slowing down the algorithm's fairness improvements. This experiment is",
