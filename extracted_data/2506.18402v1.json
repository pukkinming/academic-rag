The existing methods lack the ability to effectively integrate multiscale features and temporal-frequency relationships. In this study, we propose a method for infant cry emotion recognition using an improved Emphasized Channel Attention, Propagation and Aggregation in Time Delay Neural Network (ECAPA-TDNN) with both multi-scale feature fusion and attention enhancement. Experiments on a public dataset show that the proposed method achieves accuracy of 82.20%, number of parameters of 1.43 MB and FLOPs of 0.32 Giga.

      "text": "Infant cries encode biologically significant information through acoustic features like frequency, duration, and timbre, correlating with emotional/physical states and influenced by individual variability and environmental noise. Dunstan's theory identifies primal, reflexive vocalizations in infants aged 0-3 months linked to specific physiological needs, verified in later studies  [1] . Post-neonatal stages involve complex cries. Practical applications require multimodal integration of cry acoustics, behavioral cues, and contextual data.\n\nRecent advances in signal processing and data-driven algorithms have enabled infant cry analysis for detection  [2] -  [5] , cause classification  [6] -  [13] , and pathological diagnosis  [14] -  [16] . Traditional methods rely on handcrafted acoustic features (e.g., Mel-frequency cepstral coefficients, linear prediction coefficient, spectral centroid) combined with classifiers (e.g., support vector machine, random forest, logistic regression  [2] ,  [6] -  [8] . Hybrid methods, such as multistage ensemble models, achieve accuracies up to 93.7%  [8] .\n\nDeep-learning based methods exceed the above traditional methods by extracting deep embeddings from samples. Transfer learning with pretrained Convolutional Neural Network (CNNs) or spectrogram-based network of long-short term memory attains accuracy of 92~99% for cry detection  [5]  and cry classification  [9] . CNNs struggle with long-term dependencies, whereas recurrent neural networks (RNNs) are computationally inefficient. Models combining CNNs, RNNs, and attention mechanisms can further improve the performance of emotion recognition  [10] -  [12] .\n\nDesplanques et al. propose the ECAPA-TDNN with an attention module of Squeeze Excitation (SE), and win first place at the VoxSRC2020 competition  [17] . In a recent study  [18] , the ECAPA-TDNN is used for speaker verification based on infant cry, and an equal error rate of 25.8% is obtained. It is shown that the ECAPA-TDNN can learn effective embeddings from samples, and obtain higher accuracy than other models.\n\nInfant cries are emotionally nuanced, whose characteristics are hard to be captured by the model. Environmental noises further disrupt infant cries, and thus degrade the model's performance. In addition, training datasets of infant cries are relatively small-scale, which leads to a decrease in the model's generalization ability and adaptability. The ECAPA-TDNN has three critical limitations for emotion recognition of infant cries.\n\nFirst, its single-scale convolutional design with fixed kernel sizes and fixed dilation rates restricts the receptive field adaptability. As a result, multi-scale emotional information cannot be effectively captured. For instance, pain-induced highfrequency spikes require small receptive fields for precise localization, while hunger-induced rhythmic patterns demand larger scales to discern trends. Hence, single-scale convolution will result in blurry information and incomplete utilization of multi-scale emotional information.\n\nSecond, the ECAPA-TDNN lacks effective interlayer feature fusion mechanisms. Shallow layers capture low-level acoustic features, while deep layers extract abstract representations. The absence of cross-layer integration hampers the comprehensive interaction of features.\n\nThird, the temporal and channel attention mechanisms operate in isolation without synergistic interaction. Temporal attention focuses on time-series importance, while channel attention emphasizes frequency-band significance. However, the isolated usage of temporal and channel attentions prevents the model from effectively integrating the time-frequency intertwined emotional cues. The disconnection between temporal and channel attention modules limits the model's holistic feature integration capability and decision-making capability, and finally reduces the model's recognition accuracy.\n\nIn short, the limitations in scale adaptability, hierarchical feature fusion, and attention synergy constrain the ECAPA-TDNN's performance in recognizing infant cry emotion. To overcome the above deficiencies of the ECAPA-TDNN, we propose an improved ECAPA-TDNN for infant cry emotion recognition in this paper.",

Figure  1  illustrates the frameworks of both ECAPA-TDNN and improved ECAPA-TDNN.\n\nIn the improved ECAPA-TDNN, the modules of Residual Squeeze-and-Excitation (RSE), Multi-scale Channel Attention (MCA) and differential attention are incorporated into the architecture of the ECAPA-TDNN. In addition, the global average pooling and Softmax substitute for the attentive statistics pooling and AAM-Softmax of the ECAPA-TDNN, respectively. The RSE module implements cross-dimensional interaction between the time-varying patterns and critical frequency bands, and thus effectively bridges the temporal and spectral domains. The MCA module enhances the feature extraction backbone by parallel multi-scale dilated convolution, and thus captures both localized spectro-temporal structures and extended contextual dynamics in the infant vocalizations. The global average pooling compresses the channel-wise feature representations, followed by the differential attention module, which can correct the fused channel weights by emphasizing emotion-relevant channels based on learned interdependencies. In summary, the layers within the blue dotted-line box in Figure  1 (b ) not only enhance the interaction of features between layers but also prevent the emergence of issues such as gradient vanishing.",

      "text": "To enhance the model's ability to extract discriminative features across different receptive fields, we propose a MCA module that integrates multi-scale feature extraction with channel-wise adaptive weighting  [13] ,  [19] . As illustrated in Figure  2 , the MCA module consists of two key components: parallel convolutional branches with varying dilation rates for multi-scale context aggregation, and a channel attention mechanism for feature recalibration.\n\nFor an input feature map 𝑿 ∈ ℝ ( × ) , the multi-scale transformation is defined by\n\nwhere 𝐶𝑜𝑛𝑣 × ( ) denotes a convolution with kernel size 1× 𝑘 (\n\nwhere T denotes the number of time steps. Subsequently, channel dependencies are learned through a gating mechanism using two fully-connected layers: 𝒔 = 𝜎 𝑾 𝟐 𝛿(𝑾 𝟏 𝒛) ∈ ℝ , (5) where 𝛿 (‧) and 𝜎 (‧) denote ReLU function and Sigmoid activation function, respectively; 𝑾 ∈ ℝ ( / )× and 𝑾 ∈ ℝ ×( / ) represent trainable weight matrices with reduction ratio r. The output of the block is obtained through channelwise scaling: 𝑭 = 𝒔 ⊙ 𝑭 ∈ ℝ × (6) where ⊙ denotes channel-wise multiplication. The original spatial resolution can be preserved, and discriminative channel responses can be enhanced. This approach for multi-scale feature extraction, coupled with the SE mechanism to adjust channel weights, not only addresses the issue of ECAPA-TDNN's single-scale feature extraction but also maintains the coherence of the attention mechanism. This is crucial for the classification of infant crying causes, because the usage of global pooling operations avoids the premature reduction of dimensions, which will lead to the neglect of the importance of feature extraction.",

      "text": "Table  1  presents the ablation experimental results obtained by the improved ECAPA-TDNN with different combinations of MCA, RSE and differential-attention modules. From the results of Table  1 , we can draw two conclusions. First, each of the above three modules has an impact on the accuracy obtained by the proposed model for infant crying emotion recognition. Moreover, the MCA module has the greatest impact on the accuracy, since the accuracy drops from 82.20% to 78.37% after removing it. Second, when all the three modules are used together, the proposed model obtains the highest accuracy score of 82.20%. Hence, each module has complementarity and can work together to improve the accuracy of the proposed model. The improved ECAPA-TDNN is compared with two state-of the-art models, namely the ECAPA-TDNN and the Resnet18. The results obtained by different models are listed in Table  2 . The improved ECAPA-TDNN obtains the accuracy score of 82.20%. Its accuracy score is higher than that obtained by both ECAPA-TDNN and Resnet18. The accuracy gain obtained by the improved ECAPA-TDNN is mainly attributed to the integration of multi-scale feature extraction, optimization of the connection and coherence of the attention mechanism. The multi-scale feature extraction module can capture rich feature representations of the samples. The cross-layer connection module can realize the comprehensive interaction of features. The interaction between temporal and channel attention modules can improve the model's abilities of holistic feature integration and decision-making. Hence, the improved ECAPA-TDNN achieves higher accuracy scores compared to the two state-of-the-art models, namely ECAPA-TDNN and Resnet18. The number of parameters and the FLOPs of the improved ECAPA-TDNN are 1.43 MB and 0.32 Giga, respectively. These two values are higher than the counterparts of the ECAPA-TDNN but lower than the counterparts of the Resnet18. That is, it doesn't and does have advantage over the ECAPA-TDNN and the Resnet18 in complexity, respectively.\n\nThe confusion matrix of the improved ECAPA-TDNN for classifying infant cry emotions is shown in Figure  5 . There are differences in the degree of confusion between different categories. The confusion between \"awake\" and \"hungry\" is the highest (reaching 12.15%). However, the confusion between \"sleepy\" and \"diaper\", and the confusion between \"awake\" and \"uncomfortable\", reach the lowest value of 0. For comparison convenience, Figures  6  and 7  depict the confusion matrices of the ECAPA-TDNN and Resnet18, respectively. From the results in Figure  5  to Figure  7 , it can be known that the ECAPA-TDNN and Resnet18 have higher levels of confusion for various categories of emotions than the improved ECAPA-TDNN.",

Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed model achieves the accuracy score of 82.20% which is higher than that obtained by two state-of-the-art models, namely ECAPA-TDNN and Restnet18. Hence, it has advantage over other two models in accuracy.\n\nHowever, the proposed model still has its own limitations. First, its complexity is higher than the ECAPA-TDNN. Second, its attention modules mainly concentrate on the temporalchannel interactions, but spatial dependencies in spectrogram representations remain underutilized. In the future work, we will explore hybrid attention architectures by incorporating spatial-spectral relationships. We will also take measures to reduce the complexity of the model for deploying it on edge devices, such as knowledge distillation, pruning, and parameter compression of models.",
