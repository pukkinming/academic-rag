      "text": "Emotion is a complicated physiological response of human beings, which plays an important role in our daily life and work  [25] . Positive emotions help us to improve human health and work efficiency, while negative emotions may cause health problems  [20] . Nowadays emotion recognition has been widely used in many scientific and technological fields, such as human-computer interaction, distance education, and health care, etc., and has gained wide attention of academic research.\n\nIn general, there are two different ways to recognize emotion. One is to directly consider non-physiological signals such as facial expressions  [9] , speech  [46] , body gesture  [31] , text  [26]  to construct models, which collect data in a non-invasive way. However, for this approach, it is difficult to obtain correct emotions if people deliberately mask their true feelings  [28] . Another approach is to consider physiological signals such as heart rate  [32] , skin conductivity  [2] , respiration  [16] , and EEG to classify emotions. EEG, signaled by the central nervous system, is a direct response to brain activity and is more objective and reliable in capturing real human emotions.\n\nEEG-based emotion recognition methods can be roughly partitioned into two parts: EEG feature extraction and emotion classification. Firstly, EEG features are extracted from the time domain, frequency domain, and time-frequency domain  [19] . Then, they are used to train a classifier. Researchers mainly construct models using machine learning methods to deal with EEG emotion recognition tasks. However, the existing machine learning methods ignore the symmetric spatial characteristics of EEG signals, which may also contain salient information related to emotion. Deep learning has been widely applied in recent years, which has demonstrated its capabilities of temporal and spatial feature extraction in multi-channel EEG emotion recognition.\n\nFor example, in  [45] , researchers applied GCN to extract graph domain feature and LSTM to capture temporal features, and in  [17] , researchers also used convolutional neural network (CNN) to capture spatial features.\n\nAlthough the existing emotion recognition models have achieved high accuracy, most models only consider spatial features of adjacent channels but ignore the symmetry of human brain in information processing. Neurological studies  [5]  have shown that asymmetrical activities of the brain are effective in emotional processing, which indicates that there exist strong correlations for symmetrical channels in brain activities. Thus, how to capture adjacent and symmetrical features more effectively is still an interesting topic in the research of emotion recognition.\n\nTo apply the symmetric mechanism of human brain for EEG data processing, a spatial folding ensemble network named SFE-Net for the EEG feature extraction and emotion recognition is proposed in this paper. First, the input EEG channels data is folded with five different symmetrical folding strategies: the left-right folding, the right-left folding, the top-bottom folding, the bottom-top folding, and the entire double-sided brain folding. Additionally, to enable the SFE-Net to extract feature information of temporal and spatial features, an improved Bicubic-interpolation is proposed for EEG channel information completion, from which the proposed network can extract a wider range of adjacent and symmetrical spatial features of a human brain. Then 3D-CNN based spatial and temporal extraction and a multi-voting strategy of ensemble learning are employed to model a new neural network, from which the spatial features of different folds can be extracted simultaneously, which greatly improves the robustness and accuracy of emotion recognition.\n\nIn summary, the main contributions of this paper are as follows:\n\n(1) An improved interpolation algorithm with five different symmetric folding strategies is proposed to reinforce the sample data, which is helpful for the model to extract more effective features of adjacent and symmetrical spatial features more effectively in the next step.\n\n(2) A multi-voting strategy of 3D-CNN with ensemble learning is proposed for the folded signals, which greatly improves the robustness and accuracy of emotion recognition.\n\n(3) Extensive experiments are conducted on two benchmark datasets. The experimental results show that the proposed algorithm has comparable performance in terms of recognition accuracy.",

[47]  proposed an adaptive k-nearest neighbors search and random non-linear regression for image interpolation to improve picture resolution. Zhou et al.  [49]  implemented a bilinear interpolation algorithm on novel enhanced quantum image representation (NEQR). Khaledyan et al.  [14]  implemented a bilinear and bicubic image interpolation with low cost to efficiently improve the real-time image super-resolution.\n\nSince EEG signals can also be viewed as images, many researchers have recently applied interpolation algorithms to enhance the spatial structure of EEG. For example, Huang et al.  [11]  proposed a separable convolutional neural network(CNN) with bilinear interpolation in a brain-computer interface for EEG classification. Svantesson et al.  [37]  utilized CNN as an interpolation method to upsample and restore channels, which finally recreate EEG signals with higher accuracy. In the field of EEG-based emotion recognition, interpolation algorithms are still relatively scarce. Cho et al.  [50]  used RBF (Radial Basis Function) interpolation algorithm to construct a new 2D EEG signal frame, which combines with DE (Differential Entropy) characteristics to achieve higher accuracy. However, RBF is a global interpolation algorithm, which may result in large errors when the EEG value is in a local drastic variation. To overcome the limitation, a new interpolation approach called the improved Bicubic-EEG interpolation is proposed, which can avoid the issue that local drastic changes lead to precision decline.",

      "text": "Neurological studies  [23] ,  [7]  have shown that emotional response is closely related to the cerebral cortex of the human brain, which is a 3D spatial structure and is not completely symmetrical between the left and right hemispheres. Consequently, emotion-related features of EEG signals, which in essence belong to time series, may not only exist on a temporal dimension but also exist on a spatial dimension for adjacent and symmetrical channels. For temporal feature extraction, some researchers utilize deep learning models to obtain dynamic information based on raw EEG signals automatically. Soleymani et al.  [33]  proposed an LSTM-RNN and continuous conditional random field algorithm to detect the emotional state of the subjects from their EEG signals and facial expressions. Anubhav et al.  [1]  proposed an LSTM neural network that could efficiently learn the features from the band power of EEG signals. Fourati et al.  [8]  presented an Echo State Network (ESN), which applied a recursive layer to perform the feature extraction step directly from the raw EEG.\n\nFor spatial feature extraction, Yang et al.  [44]  proposed a parallel convolutional recurrent neural network to extract spatial characteristics of EEG streams, which convert the chain-like EEG sequence into a 2D-like frame sequence. Li et al.  [17]  presented a hierarchical convolutional neural network to capture spatial information among different channels based on 2D EEG maps. Song et al.  [35]  proposed a dynamical graph convolutional neural network to explore the deeper-level spatial information for adjacent channels, which utilized a graph to model the multichannel EEG signals.\n\nAlthough these methods all reconstruct the EEG matrix based on the actual channel position of the brain to obtain spatial structure, they fill the undetected electrodes with zero in the matrix, which may destroy the original structure and lead to errors in classification. More importantly, they ignore the correlations for symmetrical channels, which also contain salient information in brain activities. To address the above-mentioned limitations, we propose the SFE-Net model, which takes into account adjacent and symmetrical spatial features simultaneously.",

The two-dimensional EEG image for emotion recognition has been widely studied in recent years  [43] . For example, the one-dimensional vector of each original EEG frame is 32*1 and the two-dimensional EEG image is 9*9. To improve the inconsistency and uncertainty of the spatial information between multiple adjacent channels, each frame of EEG channels is mapped to a matrix according to the structure of the human brain to obtain two-dimensional EEG images. As shown in Fig.  1 , the left part 2 is a plan view of the international 10-20 system. And the blue-filled EEG electrodes are the test points implemented in the DEAP dataset. We relocate each time sampling to a two-dimensional electrode topology according to the spatial position of the electrode. The unused electrodes are filled with zero.

      "text": "Since there are certain unsampled parts between the brain electrical electrodes, we believe that this may ignore some critical information. So an improved interpolation algorithm is developed to reconstruct them. After comprehensively calculating the area around the blank space of the proposed algorithm, the new values can be obtained.\n\nFor the improved Bicubic-EEG interpolation algorithm, the inspiration came from the bicubic interpolation. In numerical analysis, bicubic interpolation is one of the most frequently used interpolation methods in a two-dimensional space. The classic algorithms of linear interpolation include: nearest neighbor method, bilinear interpolation, bicubic B-spline interpolation  [40]  etc. Although the nearest neighbor method is simple and easy to implement, it will produce obvious jagged edges and mosaics in the new image. For bilinear interpolation, it has a smoothing function and can effectively overcome the drawbacks of the nearest neighbor method, but bilinear interpolation will degrade the high-frequency part of the image and make the image details blurred. As for the bicubic B-spline interpolation, compared to the bilinear interpolation, the transition and smoothness of the image will be focused more. However, the disadvantage is that the cost of computation is relatively high. The original Bicubic-EEG interpolation method can increase the receptive field of adjacent areas to obtain higher efficiency of data completion. We re-optimized the algorithm according to the distribution of the EEG channels to solve the problem of the large cost of calculation in bicubic interpolation. Fig.  2  shows the improved Bicubic-EEG interpolation method. The right part in Fig.  2  is a simple profile of the algorithm.\n\nSpecifically, the detailed description of the improved Bicubic-EEG interpolation algorithm is shown as follows:\n\nThe original BiCubic function  [13]  is\n\nwhere 𝑎 is in [-1, 0].  [13]  demonstrated that the best value of 𝑎 is -0.5. For the interpolated EEG channels (𝑥, 𝑦), the points (𝑥 𝑖 , 𝑦 𝑗 ) is taken in a 3 × 3 neighborhood, 𝑖, 𝑗 = 0, 1, 2, . . . Then the interpolate points will be computed as follows,\n\nwhere 𝑓 (𝑥, 𝑦) is the value to be filled at (𝑥, 𝑦), and 𝑓 (𝑥 𝑖 , 𝑦 𝑖 ) is the value of the EEG channels at (𝑥 𝑖 , 𝑦 𝑖 ). Since 𝑓 (𝑥 𝑖 , 𝑦 𝑖 ) in Eq. (  2 ) may have 𝑓 (𝑥 𝑖 , 𝑦 𝑖 ) = 0. In this case, the 𝑓 (𝑥 𝑖 , 𝑦 𝑖 ) is taken as the center, and again set a 3 × 3 neighborhood. After the neighborhood points are averaged, the value of 𝑓 (𝑥 𝑖 , 𝑦 𝑖 ) is obtained. In this case, 𝑓 (𝑥, 𝑦) as defined as follows:\n\nwhere 𝐴𝑣𝑔() is the average of the non-zero part of data. Thus, the interpolation can be obtained.",

The folds include folding symmetrically from left to right or right to left, folding symmetrically from top to bottom or bottom to top, and folding the entire double-sided brain completely. In all, we have five types of folding. All the folding approaches are shown in Fig.  3 . These five folding results are employed as the input data of the SFE-Net.

Then, it flexibly combines the basic learners of the learning results.\n\nSince the learning results for different algorithms generally have certain differences, the combined learning result is usually better than that of an individual algorithms. The design of each basic classifier in ensemble learning should be different from each other. Generally, a basic classifier can be constructed by using different input features, training sets, and learning algorithms  [27] . To have some difference for different algorithms  [6] , we consider that not only the left and right sides of the brain may have symmetrical regional features, but the front and rear sides of the brain may also have symmetrical regional features. Thus ensemble learning can be applied to synthesize the characteristics of front and rear symmetry and the left and right symmetry at the same time.

Firstly, the model with the space-time extraction capabilities of 3D-CNN was trained parallelly.\n\nSecondly, we integrated all the different folding results and obtained the final result of the voting decision.\n\nThe SFE-Net model includes four convolutional layers. Since the time dimension is doubled after folding, the purpose of the first layer of convolution is to extract features in the time dimension and reduce the number of parameters. To reduce the loss of information of the input data, zero padding is used in each convolutional layer. After each convolution, batch-normalization is adopted. Then RELU activation function is utilized to increase nonlinearity. The pooling size of the largest pooling layer is 2 × 1 × 1, which can reduce the size of the data in the time dimension. The feature maps of each layer are 8, 8, 16, and 32 respectively. Finally, a fully connected layer is designed to map the 32 feature maps into a feature vector of 512 dimensions. After regularization, set dropout = 0.5 to avoid over-fitting in a fully connected layer. In each convolutional layer, L2 regularization may prevent over-fitting, and L2=0.001. The Adam optimizer can minimize the cross-entropy loss function. The learning rate is set to 0.001. The learning epoch is 100.

Thus, the results show that the algorithm we poposed can obtain state of art performance, which significantly demonstrate the effectiveness of the algorithm in learning spatial symmetry and spatial region information. However, in the proposed work, only single-mode experiments were performed. In the future, we will explore how to construct a multi-modal model to better extract various features.",
