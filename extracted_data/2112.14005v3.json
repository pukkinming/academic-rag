      "text": "Machine learning models need to provide contrastive explanations, since people often seek to understand why a puzzling prediction occurred instead of some expected outcome. Current contrastive explanations are rudimentary comparisons between examples or raw features, which remain difficult to interpret, since they lack semantic meaning. We argue that explanations must be more relatable to other concepts, hypotheticals, and associations. Inspired by the perceptual process from cognitive psychology, we propose the XAI Perceptual Processing Framework and RexNet model for relatable explainable AI with Contrastive Saliency, Counterfactual Synthetic, and Contrastive Cues explanations. We investigated the application of vocal emotion recognition, and implemented a modular multi-task deep neural network to predict and explain emotions from speech. From think-aloud and controlled studies, we found that counterfactual explanations were useful and further enhanced with semantic cues, but not saliency explanations. This work provides insights into providing and evaluating relatable contrastive explainable AI for perception applications.",

      "text": "Much research has been done to develop explainable AI (XAI) for improving model transparency and trustworthiness. An intuitive approach is to point out which features are most important. Attribution explanations do this by identifying importance using gradients  [99] , ablation  [92] , activations  [97] , or decompositions  [8, 75, 90] . In computer vision, attributions take the form of saliency maps (e.g.,  [97] ). Explaining by referring to key examples is another popular approach. This includes simply providing arbitrary samples of specific classes, cluster prototypes or criticisms  [46] , or influential training set instances  [49] . However, users typically have expectations and goals when asking for explanations.\n\nUsers ask for contrastive explanations when expected outcomes do not happen. A simple answer would find the attribution differences between the actual (fact) and expected (foil) outcomes  [84]  However, this is naive because users are truly asking for what differences in feature values, not attributions, would lead to the alternative outcome. That is a counterfactual explanation. Furthermore, to anticipate a future outcome or prevent an undesirable one, users could ask for counterfactual explanations. Indeed, contrastive explanations are often conflated with counterfactual explanations in the research literature. Such explanations suggest the minimum changes in the current case to achieve the desired outcome  [103] . Trained decision structures, such as local foil trees  [102] , Bayesian rule lists  [55] , or structural causal models  [73]  can also serve as counterfactual explanations. Though typically explained in terms of feature values  [20, 54, 103]  or anchor rules  [91] , techniques have been developed to synthesize counterfactuals of unstructured data (e.g., images  [29]  and text  [33] ). In this work, we employ the synthesis approach to generate counterfactuals of audio data.\n\nThere are many explanation types and Lim and Dey have framed them in an intelligibility taxonomy as Why (Attribution), Why Not (Contrastive), and How To (Counterfactual)  [59] . Many of these XAI techniques have been independently developed or tested, so their usage is disparate. In this work, we unify them in a common framework and integrate them in a single machine learning model.",

To close this gap, HCI researchers have been active in evaluating the various benefits of XAI or lack thereof, including understanding and trust  [64] , uncertainty  [62, 105, 110] , cognitive load  [2] , types of examples  [11] , etc. Studies have sought to determine the \"best\" explanation type  [64, 100] , but others have revealed the benefit of reasoning with multiple explanations  [6, 61, 63] . Hence, we propose a unified framework to provide multiple relatable explanations together. We determined our human-centered explanation requirements by studying literature on human cognition, which is epistemologically similar to works grounded in philosophy and psychology  [72, 104] , and unlike empirical approaches to elicit user requirements  [22, 58, 59] . Furthermore, current works focus on explaining higher-level reasoning tasks, but not perception tasks that are commonplace. This has implications on the depth of explanations to provide, which we investigate in this work.",

Leveraging the intrinsic time-series structure of speech data, recurrent neural network (RNN) models with attention mechanism have been developed to capture transient acoustic features to understand contextual information  [74] . Employing popular techniques from the computer vision domain, audio data can be treated as 1D arrays or converted to a spectrogram as a 2D image. Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) can then extract spatial features from these audiograms or spectrograms  [37] . Current approaches improve performance by combining CNN and RNN  [101, 114] , or modeling with multiple modalities  [111] . Our RexNet model starts with a base CNN model to leverage many more XAI techniques available to CNNs than RNNs. Since our approach is modular, it can be generalized to state-of-the-art SER models.",

      "text": "Due to the availability of image data and intuitiveness of vision, much XAI research has focused on image prediction tasks; in contrast, few techniques have been developed for audio prediction tasks. Many techniques exploit CNN explanations by generating a saliency map on the audio spectrogram  [4, 52] . Other explanations focus on model debugging by visualizing neuron activations  [51] , or as feature visualizing  [56]  (like  [78]  for image kernels). We also leverage saliency maps as one explanation, due to its intuitive pointing, but augment it with relatable explanations. Other than explaining the model behavior post-hoc, another approach is to make the model more interpretable and trustworthy by constraining the trained model with domain knowledge, such as with voice-specific parametric convolutional filters  [67, 88] . Our approach with modular explanations of specific types follows a similar objective. For visual clarity, we present the use case for visually recognizing a cat instead of a dog, although we use vocal emotion recognition for our prediction task and evaluation.

      "text": "The perceptual process defines three stages for how humans perceive and understand stimuli: selection, organization, and interpretation  [13] . Fig.  1  illustrates these stages for the case of visually perceiving a cat and relates them to our technical approach. When sensory stimuli (e.g., light rays or audio vibrations) reach the senses, 1) our brain first selects only a subset of the information to focus attention. This is equivalent to highlighting salient regions in an image.\n\n2) The next stage organizes the salient regions into meaningful cues. For a face, these would include recognizing the ears, eyes, and nose. 3) Finally, the brain interprets these lower-level cues towards higher-level concepts. In our example, the face cues are used to recognize the animal by: a) recalling from long-term memory the concepts of cat and dog, and their respective cues, b) compare whether each element is closer to the cat or dog version (Fig.  1  uses a slider paradigm for illustration), and c) categorize the concept with the smallest difference. For our application in vocal emotion recognition, the perceptual processing framework aligns with Kotz et al's model for processing emotion prosody  [79, 95]  that describes stages for \"extracting sensory/acoustic features, detecting meaningful relations, conceptual processing of the acoustic patterns in relation to emotion-related knowledge held in long-term memory. \"\n\nIn particular, people categorize concepts by mentally recalling examples and comparing their similarities  [27] . These examples may be prototypes or exemplars. With Prototype Theory, people summarize and recall average examples, but these may be quite different from the observed case being compared. With Exemplar Theory, people memorize and recall specific examples, but this does not scale with inexperienced cases. Instead, people can imagine new cases that they have never experienced  [10] . Moreover, rather than tacitly comparing some ill-defined difference between the examples, people make comparisons by judging similarities or differences along dimensions (cues)  [77] . Categorization can then be done systematically with proposition rules or intuitively  [40] , with either sometimes being more effective  [69] .\n\nWe apply this framework and propose a unified technical approach with contrastive explanation types to align with each stage of perceptual processing: 1) highlight saliency, 2) recognize cues, 3a) synthesize counterfactual, 3b) compare cues, and 3c) classify concept. We further present cue differences as rules and leverage an embedding for emotions to represent intuition (described later).",

In this work, we focus on vocal cues (prosody) identified by Juslin et al. (e.g., see Table  1 ). These cues are about how words are spoken, rather than the words themselves (lexical information). We leverage people's ability to index vocal emotion categories by the pattern of cues  [39]  to identify cue differences between different emotions, which we present in our model explanation. Although people may be able to perceive various vocal cues, they may be unable to relate to them conceptually (e.g., \"formant frequency\" is technically complex), therefore, we limit cues to familiar everyday concepts. In our user study, we further verified their understandability in a screening test. For our prediction application, the concept to predict is emotion, cues are vocal cues for emotion prosody, cue differences support dimensional comparisons, and saliency is in terms of phonemes or pauses between them.",

Treating the spectrogram as a 2D image, we can train a convolutional neural network (CNN)  [34] . Specifically, we trained a CNN with 3 convolutional blocks, and 2 fully connected layers.

We describe this in reverse starting with the goal. Ultimately, we want to explain the prediction with descriptive contrastive cues. This requires a counterfactual \"foil\" to compare the target \"fact\" with, therefore, we need to obtain an example for comparison. When making a comparison, not all stimuli are relevant for interpretation, hence, we need to select salient segments. For example, noticing a flower in a photo of a pet is irrelevant to identifying whether an animal is a dog or cat. In summary, our approach has steps: 1. Highlight salient segments i. Predict emotion concept as initial estimation ii. Keep embedding vector of estimation for final classification iii. Explain contrastive saliency using discounted Grad-CAM 2. Describe segments i.

      "text": "Saliency maps are very popular to explain predictions on images, since they intuitively highlight which pixels the model considers important for the predicted outcome  [97, 98, 115] . For spectrograms, they can identify which frequencies or time periods are most salient  [34] . However, they have limited interpretability, since they merely point to raw pixels but do not further elaborate on why those pixels were important. For timeseries data, highlighting on a spectrogram remains uninterpretable to non-technical users, since many are not trained to read spectrograms. Furthermore, some salient pixels may be important across all prediction classes, and thus be less uniquely relevant to the specific class of interest. For example, a saliency map to predict emotions from faces may always highlight the eyes regardless of emotion. To address the issue of saliency lacking semantic meaningfulness, we introduce associative cues, which we describe later. Here, we address the need for more specific saliency with a discounted saliency map to produce contrastive saliency. This retains some importance of globally important pixels, unlike current methods that simply subtract a saliency map of one class from that of another class  [84] . Dhurandhar et al.  [20]  identified pertinent positives and negatives for more precise contrastive explanations by perturbing features, but our approach calculates based on feature activations.\n\nWe define two forms of contrastive saliency: pairwise and total. Pairwise contrastive saliency highlights pixels that are important for predicting target class 𝑦 but discounts pixels that are also important for foil class 𝛾. We implemented the saliency map with Grad-CAM  [97] , and define the class activation map for class 𝑦 as s 𝑦 . The pairwise contrastive saliency between classes 𝑦 and 𝛾 is thus:\n\nwhere 𝝀 𝑦𝛾 = (1s 𝛾 ) indicates the discount factors for all pixels due to their attributions to class 𝛾, 1 is a matrix of all ones, and ⊙ is the Hadamard operator for pixel-wise multiplication. To identify important pixels for class 𝑦 but not any other class, we define total contrastive saliency as:\n\nwhere 𝝀 𝑦 = 𝛾 ∈𝐶\\𝑦 (1s 𝛾 )/|𝐶 -1| indicates the discount factors across all alternative classes, and 𝐶 is the number of classes.\n\nIn RexNet, the saliency explanation is calculated from the initial emotion classifier 𝑀 0 predicting an initial emotion concept ŷ0 . We present contrastive saliency for audio using a 1D saliency bar aligned to words in the speech (see Fig.  5 ), which aggregates saliency in the spectrogram across frequencies per time bin. This is more accessible for lay people to understand since it avoids using technical spectrograms or audiograms (audio waveforms).",

      "section_name": "Counterfactual Synthetic.",
      "text": "Due to the open-ended variability in unstructured data, counterfactual samples drawn from a training set are likely to be quite different from the target instance. Counterfactual samples will have extraneous differences that may be distracting to interpret and less meaningful for comparison. Instead, counterfactual synthetics are generated to be similar to the target instance, except sufficient differences to achieve the contrastive outcome. Fig.  3  illustrates the benefit of using counterfactual synthetics for comparison. When deciding whether a target item is more similar to a first or second reference, one would measure the target's distance to each reference. Counterfactual synthesis produces comparison references that are closer to the target item being classified, because it minimizes the differences between the target item and reference example. These counterfactual synthetics will be closer to other model samples that the model knows (prior instances in the training set), model prototypes (centroids or medoids of class clusters), or human mental exemplars (from the user's memory), since the model may not have a similar example or the human may never have seen or heard a very similar case to the target item. This amplifies the ratio between the reference distances larger, and makes the difference more perceptible. Formally, the ratio of differences for counterfactual synthetics are larger than for other examples (prototypes, or samples of prior items), i.e., |𝑙𝑜𝑔(𝛿 1 /𝛿 2 )| > |𝑙𝑜𝑔(𝑑 1 /𝑑 2 )|. Therefore, counterfactual synthetics help make comparison between references more easy.\n\nWe aim to create a counterfactual that is similar to the target instance 𝒙 which is classified as class 𝑦, but with sufficient differences to be classified as another class 𝛾. Current counterfactual methods focus on structured (tabular) data by minimizing changes to the target instance  [76, 103] , or identifying anchor rules  [91] , but this is not possible for unstructured data (e.g., images, sounds). Instead, inspired by data synthesis with Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs)  [44, 86]  and style transfer  [16, 117] , we propose  For vocal emotion recognition, we aim to change the emotion of the speech audio while retaining the original words and identity by using an extension of StarGAN  [16]  for voice data, StarGAN-VC  [41]  (Fig.  4 ). As a generative adversarial model, StarGAN trains three models -a generator 𝐺, discriminator 𝐷, and domain classifier 𝑀. 𝐺 inputs the target instance 𝒙 that is of class 𝑦 and the objective class 𝛾 to generate a similar instance 𝒙 𝛾 . The training objectives are to make x𝛾 ≈ 𝒙 and 𝑀 (𝒙 𝛾 ) ≈ 𝛾. Next, x𝛾 and 𝑦 are input into 𝐺 to get x𝑦 as output. 𝐺 is trained to minimize the cycle consistency reconstruction loss between 𝒙 𝑦 and 𝒙, which also improves 𝒙 𝛾 . 𝒙 𝛾 is also input into the 𝑀 to output class γ, which is trained to minimize the loss between γ and 𝛾. Finally, 𝐷 is trained to ensure that the generated instances are more realistic d. Together, this semisupervised method trains 𝐺 to generate style-transferred instances.",

      "text": "The final contrastive explanation involves first inferring cues from the target and counterfactual instances and comparing them. We define the individual cue as absolute cues (ĉ 𝑦 and ĉ𝛾 ), and the difference as contrastive cues ĉ𝑦𝛾 . We report on 6 vocal cues identified by Juslin and Laukka  [39]  for vocal emotions (Table  1 ). Absolute cues can be inferred with machine learning predictions or heuristically. For vocal emotions, since cues can be deterministically measured from the input data, we use heuristic methods M c to infer the cues c. For example, pitch range is calculated as follows: a) calculate fundamental frequency (modal frequency bin) for each CAM-salient time window in the spectrogram, b) calculate their standard deviation. For semantically abstract cues, such as sounding \"melodic\", \"questioning\", or \"nasally\", they should be annotated by humans and inferred using supervised learning.  We calculated contrastive cues as ordinal cue difference relations r 𝑦𝛾 𝑤 from numeric cue differences ĉ𝑦𝛾 based on the instances in the RAVDESS dataset  [66] . To determine differences between emotions for each cue, we fit the data to a linear mixed effects model with emotion as the main fixed effect and voice actors as random effect (see Supplementary Fig.  1 ), and performed a Tukey HSD test with significance level 𝛼 = .005 to account for the multiple comparison effect. For each cue, if an emotion is not significantly higher than the other, then we label the cue difference as \"similar\"; otherwise, we label it as \"higher\" or \"lower\" depending on the direction. Table  2  describes the vocal cue patterns of each emotion compared to average levels, which is in close agreement with  [39]  except for the fearful emotion. Table  3  describes the pairwise cue difference relations between each emotion and an emotion (happy).\n\nPredicting the cue difference relations r 𝑦𝛾 𝑤 requires deciding the decision threshold at which to split the cue difference ĉ𝑦𝛾 to categorize the relation, and this can contextually depend on initially estimating which emotion concepts ŷ0 and γ0 to compare, and which cues are more relevant. We define this as a multi-task model with two sub-models with fully connected neural network layers 𝑀 𝑟 and 𝑀 𝑦 . 𝑀 𝑦 takes in the numeric cue differences ĉ𝑦𝛾 and embedding representations (from the penultimate fully connected layer) of the emotion concepts ẑ𝑦 0 and ẑ𝛾 0 to predict the emotion ŷ heard in 𝑥. We determine which cues were more important by calculating an attribution explanation ŵ𝑦𝛾 𝑐 with layer-wise relevance propagation (LRP)  [8] . These attributions are then concatenated on ĉ𝑦𝛾 to determine the weighted cue differences ŵ𝑦𝛾 𝑐 . 𝑀 𝑟 takes in ŵ𝑦𝛾 𝑐 , ẑ𝑦 0 and ẑ𝛾 0 to predict the cue difference relations r 𝑦𝛾 𝑤 . With the ground truth references, cue difference relations prediction can be trained using supervised learning. Since the cue difference relations (lower, similar, higher) are ordinal, we employed the NNRank ordinal encoding  [15]  with 2 classes, such that lower = (0, 0) 𝑇 , similar = (1, 0) 𝑇 , higher = (1, 1) 𝑇 , sigmoid activation, and binary cross-entropy loss for multi-label classification.",

Though the final emotion accuracy is slightly lower than the initial emotion prediction (78.5% vs. 79.5%), this is expected since interpretability typically trades-off accuracy  [31] . The ablated accuracy decrease indicates that the saliency pixels are somewhat important. Contrastive Saliency has slightly less importance than Absolute Saliency (13.7% vs. 14.9%), because the former excludes pixels that are commonly important for all classes. Counterfactual synthesis was moderately successful, achieving reasonable reconstruction similarity (reconstruction error MSE = 0.680), good speaker re-identification (60.2% compared to 4.2% random chance), and somewhat recognizable emotion which is significantly better than random chance (30.7% vs. 12.5%). The predictions of cue difference relations were good (71.9%).\n\nAlthough the counterfactual synthesis accuracy was better than chance, it is still too low to be used by people. Hence, we evaluated instead using Counterfactual Samples (C.Samples), which uses actual voice clips corresponding to the same voice actor (identity), same speech words, but different portrayed contrast emotion. As expected, the identity and emotion accuracies are higher for Samples than Synthetics, but the other performances were comparable.\n\nIn the next step, we investigate the usage and usefulness of each explanation type. The focus is on the interactions and interface, rather than investigating whether each explanation as implemented is good enough. Therefore, we select instances with correct predictions and coherent explanations for the user studies.

The study contains 4 explanation interface conditions: Contrastive Saliency only, Counterfactual Sample voice examples only, Counterfactual Sample and Contrastive Cues, and all 3 explanations together (Fig.  5 ).\n\nThe procedure is: read an introduction, consent to the study, complete a guided tutorial of all explanations (regardless of condition), and start the main study with multiple trials of a vocal emotion recognition task. To limit the participation duration, each participant completes three trials, each trial randomly assigned to an explanation interface condition. For each trial, the participant listened to a voice clip, and gave an initial label of the emotion. On the next page, the participant was shown the system's prediction with (or without) explanation based on the assigned condition. She could then revise her emotion label if she changed her mind. We used the think-aloud protocol to ask participants to articulate their thoughts as they examined the audio clip, prediction and explanations. We also asked them about their perceptions using the interface, and any suggestions for improvement. We describe our findings next.",

      "text": "We performed thematic analysis on the recorded audio to determine key themes (bolded). We describe our findings in terms of our research questions of how users innately infer vocal emotions, and how they used each explanation type. When inferring on their own (without XAI), participants would focus on specific cues to \"check the intonations [pitch variation] for decision\" [Participant P12], infer a Sad emotion based on the \"flatness of the voice\" [P04], or \"use shrillness to distinguish between fearful and surprise\" [P01]. Participants also relied on changes in tone, which we had not modeled. For example, a rising tone \"sounds like the man is asking a question\" [P02], \"the last word has a questioning tone\" [P03] helped participants to infer Surprise. The latter case identified the most relevant segment. In contrast, a \"tone going down at the end of sentence\" helped P01 infer Sad. Some participants mentally generated their own examples to \"imagine what neutral sound like and compare against it\" [P05]. These unprompted behaviors suggest the relevance of saliency, counterfactual, and cue explanations.\n\nThe usage of explanations was mixed with some benefits and some issues. In general, participants could understand the Saliency maps. P09 saw that \"the highlight parts are consistent with my judgment for important words\", referring to 'talking' being highlighted. However, several participants had issues with saliency maps. There were some cases with highlights that spanned across multiple words and included highlighting spaces. P08 felt that saliency \"should highlight all words\", and P14 \"would prefer the color highlighted on text\". This lack of focus made P13 feel that \"the color bar is not necessary\". Regularizing the explanation to prioritize highlighting words and penalize highlighting spaces can help align the explanations with user expectations and improve trust  [93]  Next, P11 thought that \"the color bar reflects the fluctuation of tone\". While plausible, this indicates the risk of misinterpreting technical visualizations for explanations. Finally, P12 \"used the saliency bar by listening to the highlighted part of the words, and try to infer based on intonation. But I think the highlighting in this example is not accurate\". This demonstrates causal oversimplification by reasoning with one factor rather than multiple factors  [19, 61] .\n\nMany participants found Counterfactual samples \"intuitive\". P11 could \"check whether it's consistent with my intuition\" by mentally comparing the similarity of the target audio clip (sad) with clips for other suspected emotions (neutral, sad, happy). Unfortunately, her intuition was somewhat flawed, since she inferred Neutral which was wrong. P12 found counterfactuals \"helpful to have a reference state, then I will also check the intonations for my decision. \" Conversely, some participants felt counterfactual samples were not helpful. P06 felt that the \"clips [neutral and calm] are too similar\". Had she received deeper explanations with saliency map or cue differences, she would have had more information about where and what the differences were, respectively.\n\nCues were used to check semantic consistency. P04 used cues to \"confirm my judgment\" and found that the \"low shrillness [of Sad] is consistent with my understanding. \" However, some participants perceived inconsistencies. P13 thought that \"some cue descriptions were not consistent with my perception\", and disagreed with the system that Speaking Rate was similar for the Happy and Surprised audio clips. Along with the earlier case of P06, this suggests differences in perceptual acuity of cues between the user and system.\n\nFinally, some participants felt that Counterfactual samples were more useful than Contrastive Cues. P11 found that \"the comparison voice part is more helpful than the text part, though the text part is also helpful to reinforce my decision. \" This could be due to cognitive load and differences between mental dual processing  [40] . Many participants considered the audio samples \"quite intuitive\" [P04]. They used System 1 thinking which is fast, though they did not articulate why this was simple. In contrast, they found that \"it's hard to describe or understand the voice cue patterns\" [P04]. P10 felt that \"compared with [audio] clips, cue pattern is too abstract to use for comparison.\" This requires slower System 2 thinking. Another possible reason is that the audio clip has higher information bandwidth than the 6 verbally presented semantic cues. Participants can perceive the gestalt  [48]  of the audio to make their inferences.",

We conducted a betweensubjects experiment with XAI Type as the independent variable with 5 levels of explanations (None, Contrastive Saliency, Counterfactual Sample, Counterfactual + Contrastive Cues, and Saliency + Counterfactual + Cues). The user task is to label the portrayed emotion in a voice clip with feedback from the AI in one of the XAI Types. We included emotion as a random variable with 8 levels . Having many emotions helps to make the task more challenging to test. Fig.  5  shows the UI with all explanations together, and others are shown in Supplementary Figs.  7-11.  For dependent variables, we measured decision quality (emotion label correctness and confidence), understanding of cue differences, task times, decision confidence, and perceived system helpfulness. Labeling correctness was measured with a \"balls and bins\" question  [26]  that elicits the probability of multiple labels. Cue difference understanding was measured per cue with a multiple choice question for the cue difference relation between a randomly selected contrast emotion label and the target voice clip. Task times were logged for different pages. Perceptions were measured as ratings on a 7-point Likert scale (-3 = Strongly Disagree, +3 = Strongly Agree). We asked two text questions about the rationale for perceived helpfulness and how the explanation was used. This was posed only twice to limit fatigue. See Supplementary Figs. 7-12 for the survey.",

The participant reads an introduction, consents to the study, reads a short tutorial about the explanation interfaces, and completes a screening test of audio equipment, auditory acuity, and UI understanding (Supplementary Figs.  2 3 4 ), where she: a) listens to a voice clip and chooses the correct spoken words, b) reads a saliency map and identifies important words, and c) identifies easy cue differences between two voice clips.\n\nAfter passing screening (with all questions correct), the participant is randomly assigned to an XAI Type and commences a practice session. Similar to  [64] , we conducted the practice session to enable the participant to learn from any model explanations how the system predicts the emotion. She is encouraged to study these cases carefully, since she will not see the correct predictions later in the main study. The practice session comprises 8 trials, where each trial has three pages: i) Pre-AI to listen to a voice clip, label the emotion without AI assistance. We assess the labeling correctness here to estimate the Participant Unaided Skill, i.e., whether the participant has above-or below-average skill in recognizing vocal emotions. ii) Post-XAI to read any explanation feedback (without seeing the system prediction, label the emotion (again), and answer questions about cue difference understanding, and perceived ratings. iii) Review to examine the correct emotion label (same as the system prediction) with any AI explanations, and the participant's previous answer, and write any free-form notes (open text).\n\nAfter the practice session, the participant engages in the main study with the same XAI Type in two sessions with 8 trials each and a break in-between. Each trial is presented on one page where the participant: i) listens to the voice clip, ii) views any explanation feedback, iii) labels the emotion, and iv) rates perceptions. This evaluates human-simulatability  [64, 65]  by deeply testing the participant's understanding to apply explanations to new instances.\n\nTo control any fatigue effects due to the moderate number of trials, we randomized the order of instances. We asked the rationale questions randomly in one trial per main session. The participant is incentivized to be fast and correct with a maximum $0.50 USD bonus for completing all trials within 8 minutes. The bonus is prorated by the number of correct emotion labels. Maximum bonus is $1.00 for two sessions over a base compensation of $3.00 USD. The participant ends with answering demographic questions.",

They were 52.0% male, with ages 21-70 (Median = 36). Participants took 27.4 minutes (median) to complete the survey. We excluded 14 participants who completed the survey without playing any voice clips.\n\nFor each dependent variable, we fit a linear mixed-effects model with XAI Type, Emotion, Voice Clip, Participant Unaided Skill and Trial Number as main fixed effects, and Participant as random effect. We did not find any significant interaction effects. See Supplementary Table  1  for details. We report significant results at a stricter significance level (p<.005) to account for multiple comparisons.\n\nRegarding emotion labeling in the Pre-AI Practice Trials, participants recognized some emotions better than others (Fig.  6a ) and perceived different cues with varying accuracies (Fig.  6b ), indicating that speaking rate and shrillness could be most verifiable in explanations, while pause proportion and pitch variation may be least. Furthermore, there was a wide range of average correctness among participants (M=49.9%, SD=18.3%), so we divided participants by whether they had above-or below-average unaided skill.\n\nAnalyzing the Main Trials, we found varying performances and perceptions due to different XAI Types (Fig.  7 ). Although participants may select a wrong emotion label as most likely, they may still select the correct label with low confidence in the balls and bins question. Hence, we analyzed the Confidence on Correct Label to determine the participant's decision quality. Results were similar when analyzing with labeling correctness. Fig.  7  shows that providing Counterfactual Sample voices with Cues (C.Sample + Cues) were most effective and significantly better than not providing any explanation (None), p=.0007. Omitting the cues (C.Sample) led to a decrease in decision quality such that the difference from None was marginal, p=.0160. Providing Contrastive Saliency explanations did not help to improve decision quality, and, surprisingly, neither did providing all explanations combined together. All XAI Types were rated as more helpful than None, though Saliency was only marginally so (p=.0443). All participants were equally confident (p=n.s.) in their emotion labels across XAI Types (Median=2 on -3 to 3 Likert scale). There was no difference in task time to label the emotions, though the most complex explanations (Saliency + C.Sample + Cues) was only 4.1 sec longer than None (26.1 vs. 21.0s).",

      "text": ". We report why participants found specific XAI Types helpful or unhelpful and how they used them. Some participants depended on their own ability than rely on explanations, e.g., \"I don't think that the [Saliency] explanation information is helpful. I think that the voice is all you really need to be able to determine an emotion. Some participants struggled to use the Contrastive Saliency map. P26 found it \"difficult to parse ... hard to analyze it by eye)\". Errors in the Saliency explanations also led to distrust, as described by P8 that \"the highlighted moments for Fearful don't match well with [the] voice\". Conversely, the sophistication of the explanation led to overtrusting, with P146 mentioning that it was \"helpful to view the color bar to determine which part has the most importance\", yet, this shallow interpretation led to him labeling wrongly. P117 commented that she was \"unable to listen to different ratings the system has given to each emotion\", indicating her desire to hear other samples.\n\nCounterfactual Sample explanations were more appreciated and marginally effective in improving decision quality. P38 felt that the \"emotion in the clip is very clearly anger and it helped to hear the system show me what this voice would sound like when angry\"; thus, she was matching samples by their perceived similarity. Similarly, P132 \"first made my own judgment to narrow down the possible emotions, then listen to those emotions. I rate the one that matches the highest. \" In contrast, P14 felt that C.Sample was \"helpful to tell the difference between the neutral and calm voice\" and \"tried to see if there was a change in inflection or speed\". P103 felt that \"it is slightly far away from the sample clip, every single one of them\", suggesting that he would appreciate Counterfactual Synthetics which would be generated to be more similar. Finally, P54 demurred that \"the explanation information doesn't elaborate at all why it's giving that determination, so it's mostly not helpful\"; this indicates the need for deeper semantic explanations which C.Sample + Cues provides.\n\nInstead of manually perceiving similarities or differences in voice clips, participants could read the cue differences in the Counterfactual Sample + Cues explanation. Their analytical understanding improved, as demonstrated in the vocabulary of their rationalization; e.g., P119 had a \"better sense of the speaker's pitch, loudness\". The semantic knowledge provided by cues also helped to reduce cognitive burden, e.g., P168 \"used the information to confirm something I feel ambiguous about or just to make a guess and not have to spend so much effort deciding between guesses. \" Specifically, cues helped to focus participants' analyses, e.g., P90 found the explanation \"helpful in letting you figure out what qualities to try to isolate in the voice clip to decide on where it learns in terms of emotion. \"\n\nFinally, although participants perceived Saliency + Counterfactual Sample + Cues as helpful, it did not improve decision quality. Participants rationalized the explanations by describing its various components separately, e.g., \"it helps pinpoint what parts to listen to\" [P31, Saliency], \"the sample clips for each emotion are [helpful]\" [P163, C.Sample], \"compare the voices and the levels (like shrillness and pitch)\" [P15, Cues]. However, no one explicitly described multiple components together, and there were few explicit descriptions about the saliency map. Perhaps, participants could not focus on specific explanation details. P167 was \"not sure how to apply cross the broad\", suggesting an issue with information overload.",

We have rationalized their relevance based on cognitive theories, demonstrated their benefit to improving model prediction performance, and partially validated their usefulness in user studies. We discuss takeaways for XAI developers to design relatable explanations.\n\nThe effectiveness of Counterfactual + Cues explanations indicates the value of augmenting example-based explanations with semantic information. However, we found that saliency explanations had limited usefulness. Furthermore, adding Saliency to Counterfactual + Cues nullifies any benefits of the latter. Our findings contradict those by Wang et al.  [107]  that attribution explanations were more useful than counterfactuals, possibly due to the difference of interpreting structured or unstructured data. Despite many XAI techniques being developed as saliency maps (e.g.,  [112] ), there have been recent calls to develop more meaningful explanations of image prediction tasks  [25] . Thus, saliency maps should not be used or need to be made more precisely correct (e.g., through model training or regularizations) and more semantically meaningful.\n\nTo address the weaknesses of some relatable explanations, we discuss ways to further improve their effectiveness. Using counterfactual synthetics, instead of counterfactual samples would refine the difference between the example and target, so this may focus the user's attention to more meaningful differences and improve discriminating between concepts. Moreover, our current approach identifies one set of cue differences across multiple salient locations. Instead, different cue sets can be associated with specific highlights in the saliency map. This can provide more semantics to various parts of a saliency map, to indicate why particular regions were important, and improve the usefulness of saliency maps.",

However, most people are already innately skilled in this, so this diminishes their need for AI or XAI to help them. Conversely, relatable explanations may be more useful for more analytical tasks and applications with more explicit domain knowledge (e.g., engine noise diagnosis).\n\nWe had identified several potential confounds -fatigue, skill at recognizing emotions, participants copying system predictions, learning effects from exposure to prior XAI versions -and discuss how we mitigated them. 1) We controlled for fatigue by: a) providing breaks between sessions, b) randomizing instances across trial numbers. We checked for fatigue by measuring: a) repeatedly identical responses (no participants were disqualified), b) decreases in labeling correctness over trials (no significant difference). 2) We controlled for recognition skills by measuring labeling performance without XAI (Pre-AI) and analyzed our results with that as a factor. 3) A more realistic use of AI is for it to make predictions and the user would verify its decision. However, in a pilot study evaluating with this task, we found that participants may copy the prediction rather than study the explanation, thus leading to over-trusting  [110]  and diminishing the usefulness of explanations to improve decision quality. We mitigated copying by evaluating with a human-simulatability task, instead of a predicted label verification task, though this trades-off some ecological validity. 4) We mitigated learning effects by designing the experiment as betweensubjects, otherwise, participants may exploit new knowledge in subsequent experiment conditions (with weaker explanations).",

Instead, there is a growing call to support different stakeholders and less technical users  [14, 21, 58]  Towards this end, we have studied human perception and cognition to determine new requirements for XAI. Miller had argued for contrastive and counterfactual explanations based on philosophical and psychological principles  [72] . This was extended by Wang et al. to identify human reasoning pathways that can be supported by specific XAI techniques  [107] . We extend these perspectives by identifying a broader requirement that explanations need to be relatable and contextualized to be more meaningfully interpreted. Specifically, we supported four criteria for relatability: contrastive concepts, saliency, counterfactuals, and associated cues. Extending our work, explanations can be made more relatable by providing for other criteria such as: social proof  [17, 72] , narrative stories  [96]  or rationalizations  [21] , analogies  [24] , user-defined concepts  [25, 47, 116] , and plausible explanations  [93] . Moreover, human cognition has natural flaws, like cognitive biases and limited working memory. XAI should include designs and capabilities to mitigate cognitive biases  [104] , moderate cognitive load  [2] , and accommodate information handling preferences  [105] . Relatable explanations may need to account for these human factors to communicate why they may deviate from human reasoning.\n\nThe XAI Perceptual Processing Framework was inspired by human perceptual reasoning, rather than higher-level cognition. The latter is relevant for complex decision-making tasks, such as doctors' reasoning with disease models, which are specific cases of causal structural models. Wang et al. proposed the XAI Reasoning Framework based on human reasoning processes  [104] , but this was not explicitly implemented in a single machine learning architecture. The Intelligibility Toolkit  [60]  provided an API to automatically generate explanations to a taxonomy of questions  [58, 59] , but this was not implemented for deep learning.
