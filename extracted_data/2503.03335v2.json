Current approaches often lack the granular data needed to model these personalized responses, relying instead on aggregated labels that obscure the rich variability driven by individual differences. We introduce iNews, a novel large-scale dataset specifically designed to facilitate the modeling of personalized affective responses to news content. Our dataset comprises annotations from 291 demographically diverse UK participants across 2,899 multimodal Facebook news posts from major UK outlets, with an average of 5.18 annotators per sample. For each post, annotators provide multifaceted labels including valence, arousal, dominance, discrete emotions, content relevance judgments, sharing likelihood, and modality importance ratings. Crucially, we collect comprehensive annotator persona information covering demographics, personality, media trust, and consumption patterns, which explain 15.2% of annotation variance -substantially higher than existing NLP datasets. Incorporating this information yields a 7% accuracy gain in zero-shot prediction and remains beneficial even with 32-shot in-context learning. iNews opens new possibilities for research in LLM personalization, subjectivity, affective computing, and human behavior simulation. \n Geographically Diverse UK Annotators Persona Profile Survey ... 👵🏻 👩🏻 👨🦰 🧑🏾 Disagree strongly Agree a little Agree a strongly Disagree a little 👵🏻 👩🏻 👨🦰 🧑🏾 >2 hours 15-30 minutes <15 minutes 15-30 minutes 1.

      "text": "Understanding and predicting individual human behavior represents a central challenge across social and behavioral sciences, with applications ranging from public health interventions to economic policy design. Researchers have long recognized that individual characteristics, including personality traits, demographics, cultural backgrounds, and personal experiences, fundamentally shape how people respond to identical stimuli  (Kring and Gordon, 1998; Costa and McCrae, 2008; Mesquita and Frijda, 1992) . However, computational approaches to modeling human responses in natural language processing (NLP) have largely overlooked this rich individual variability, instead relying on aggregated labels that obscure the person-specific patterns that drive real-world behavioral phenomena  (Plank, 2022; Cabitza et al., 2023) .\n\nThis limitation becomes particularly problematic in NLP applications that aim to understand or predict human responses to textual content. Current approaches typically rely on generic group-level models that ignore individual differences in how people interpret and emotionally respond to identical texts. The emergence of large language models (LLMs), to which psychological theories are increasingly applied for analysis and development  (Zhu et al., 2024; Liu et al., 2025; Hu et al., 2025) , presents new opportunities for modeling these individuallevel differences, but requires datasets that capture both behavioral outcomes and the personal characteristics that drive them.\n\nAffective responses to news content represent an ideal testing ground for benchmarking and developing individual-level behavioral simulation models. This domain offers several key advantages: (1) emotional reactions are observable behavioral outcomes with established measurement frameworks  (Mehrabian and Russell, 1974; Bradley and Lang, 1994; Ekman, 1992) , (2) individual differences in affective news processing are well-documented in psychology and media studies  (Oliver, 2002; Valkenburg and Peter, 2013; Soroka et al., 2019) , (3) the task involves real-world stimuli that people encounter daily. Furthermore, news consumption behavior has direct societal relevance for understanding information processing, media effects, and the development of responsible information systems.\n\nWe introduce iNews, a novel large-scale dataset  (2) annotators complete a persona profile survey capturing demographics, ideology, news consumption, cognitive traits, personality, and emotional characteristics; and (3) annotators provide affective response annotations for Facebook news posts, including valence, arousal, dominance, discrete emotions, modality influence, personal relevance, and sharing likelihood.\n\nspecifically designed to capture the inherent subjectivity of affective responses to real-world news content (overview in Figure  1 ). Our dataset comprises fine-grained affective responses from 291 annotators to 2,899 Facebook posts from leading UK media outlets. The annotations include: valencearousal-dominance (VAD) ratings  (Mehrabian and Russell, 1974; Bradley and Lang, 1994 ), Ekman's basic emotions  (Ekman, 1992) , perceived post relevance, modality importance, and sharing likelihood. In addition, we collect a comprehensive set of annotator characteristics 1  (e.g. demographics, personality, media consumption habits), drawing upon insights from the differential media effects literature.\n\nOur regression analysis confirms that annotator characteristics explain a substantial portion of the annotation variance (15.2% -higher than observed in any NLP dataset to date), highlighting the importance of incorporating individual differences when modeling subjective phenomena like affect. Furthermore, through an open-ended questionnaire with a subset of annotators (N = 20), we identify nuanced patterns in how individuals experience and articulate their emotional reactions to news content, extending beyond the scope of our structured annotations and survey.\n\nIn a case study demonstrating the practical value of this rich persona information, we show that incorporating annotator characteristics can improve LLM predictions of individual-level affective responses by up to 7% in accuracy in zero-shot set-tings, although overall accuracy remains relatively modest (around 40%). When comparing input modalities (image vs. text), we find that image inputs typically outperform text in zero-shot scenarios but this advantage diminishes in few-shot settings. In the few-shot setting, we observe the \"early ascent phenomenon\"  (Lin and Lee, 2024; Agarwal et al., 2024) , where performance initially dips below zero-shot levels with very few examples before improving as the number of shots increases. We ultimately reach 44.4% accuracy at 32-shot. Even at this level, incorporating persona information yields additional performance gains, suggesting that persona-based and example-based approaches provide complementary signals for modeling individual differences.\n\nThe iNews dataset benefits a wide range of research areas: affective computing researchers modeling emotion recognition while accounting for individual differences; LLM developers advancing personalization and subjective phenomena handling; human behavior simulation researchers modeling individual-level information processing; social computing scholars investigating demographic effects in content presentation; and AI alignment researchers studying preference diversity across human populations.",

      "text": "The interplay between news content, emotional responses, and downstream cognitive and behavioral effects is often an area of focus in communication and psychology. Prior research establishes that news often exhibits a negativity bias, eliciting negative emotions and heightened arousal in readers  (Soroka et al., 2019) . However, individual responses vary considerably based on demographic factors, pre-existing political attitudes and identities, personality traits, and other individual and group-level characteristics  (Oliver, 2002; Valkenburg and Peter, 2013; Soroka et al., 2019) . This heterogeneity carries significance beyond immediate emotional experiences, fundamentally influencing information processing and behavior. Emotions provide evaluative feedback, impacting veracity judgments  (Martel et al., 2020)  and shaping reasoning and decision-making  (Marcus et al., 2000; Storbeck and Clore, 2008) .\n\nExisting research on the affective dimension of news perception predominantly focuses on the emotional tone of the news content itself, rather than the induced emotional responses of individual readers  (de Hoog and Verboon, 2020) . Much of this work relies on aggregate-level analysis, obscuring individual-level variation. Our work addresses these limitations by redirecting attention to finegrained reader responses. We present a large-scale dataset designed to capture and analyze the spectrum of individual affective responses to news headlines, facilitating a more nuanced understanding of the relationship between news, emotion, and individual differences.",

      "section_name": "Emotion Detection In Nlp",
      "text": "Emotion detection has been a long-standing focus within NLP  (Strapparava and Mihalcea, 2007; Plaza-del Arco et al., 2024) . Recent years have seen a large number of valuable resources on the task (see  Demszky et al. (2020) ;  Oberländer et al. (2020) ; Plaza del  Arco et al. (2020)  for a overview). These efforts have significantly advanced the field, leading to more accurate and robust emotion detection systems.\n\nHowever, most existing datasets rely on aggregated \"gold labels\", overlooking the inherent subjectivity and variation in human emotional perception  (Ovesdotter Alm, 2011; Plank, 2022; Cabitza et al., 2023) . Extensive psychological research demonstrates the significant influence of both individual characteristics (e.g., age, gender, personality traits) and group-level factors (e.g., cultural background) on how we perceive and interpret emotions  (Mesquita and Frijda, 1992; Kring and Gor-don, 1998; Costa and McCrae, 2008; Charles and Carstensen, 2010) . Consequently, models trained on datasets with aggregated labels inevitably fail to capture the nuanced, individualized nature of affective responses. This limits their effectiveness in real-world applications that demand personalized understanding and responsiveness to diverse emotional expressions.\n\nLimited attempts have been made to incorporate annotator background information  (Plaza-del Arco et al., 2024) . For instance,  Diaz et al. (2018)  provide demographic data alongside sentiment annotations in an online community dataset; however, this work is limited by its focus on sentiment (rather than fine-grained emotions), its restriction to a specific online community, and its lack of multifaceted affective response measures. To our knowledge, no existing dataset combines comprehensive individual difference variables, fine-grained affective responses, and annotations of real-world news content, as ours does.",

      "section_name": "Dataset Collection Protocol",
      "text": "To address the limitations of existing emotion detection datasets and move towards more nuanced individual-level modeling, we develop a two-stage data collection protocol to capture individualized affective responses to news headlines (Figure  1 ). Our protocol emphasizes ecological validity and the collection of rich persona variables to enable the study of how personal characteristics influence affective responses.\n\nSampling Our dataset comprises annotations of Facebook news posts, collected in three phases to capture diverse news contexts surrounding the 2024 UK general election and the Paris Olympics (see Figure  2 ). These phases are: Phase 1 (April 1-20), the pre-election period; Phase 2 (June 5-25), the election campaign period after Parliament's dissolution; and Phase 3 (July 9-29), the post-election and pre-Olympics period.\n\nThis three-phase design ensures temporal diversity and mitigates the influence of any single major event on our findings. We initially used random sampling (Phase 1) to gather a broad sample. Recognizing that some outlets are far more prolific but have lower engagement, we transitioned to stratified sampling (Phases 2 and 3) proportional to each outlet's follower count. This approach maximizes ecological validity by ensuring our sample reflects the news content that readers are actually likely to  encounter.\n\nFor each phase, we collect news posts via Crowd-Tangle. While social media content may not represent an outlet's entire output, we posit that these posts reflect editorial choices and the outlet's intended public image. Each post typically includes an image, a short description, and the headline, with the image linking to the full article (see Figure  12  for an example). To ensure maximal ecological validity and minimize bias, we present screenshots instead of text of the posts to annotators, capturing reaction counts but excluding comments to avoid influencing annotator responses. The decision to use screenshots rather than just headlines is also supported by a pilot study (Section A.2) demonstrating significant differences in affective responses based on presentation modality.\n\nAnnotator Recruitment We recruit annotators through Prolific, using quota sampling to ensure a relatively balanced representation across gender, age, political leaning, and UK geographical regions (see Figure  6  and Table  4  for details). Each of the 291 annotators contribute annotations for approximately 50 headlines. The annotation process takes around 45 minutes. Annotators are compensated £8.58, in accordance with the UK National Living Wage at the time of the data collection.\n\nStage 1: Persona Profile Survey This stage, implemented in Qualtrics, gathers background information (\"persona variables\") about each annotator. The survey incorporates validated items from wellestablished questionnaires  (Ofcom, 2024a; Reuters Institute, 2024) , alongside standard psychological instruments. These variables (detailed in Table 4) are selected to capture individual differences known to influence news interpretation and emotional responses, enabling us to study how these factors mediate affective reactions.\n\nThe collected variables span five key areas:   (Frederick, 2005) . Personality Traits are measured using the 10-item Big Five Inventory (BFI-10)  (Rammstedt and John, 2007) . Emotional Characteristics are evaluated using both the Perth Emotional Reactivity Scale (PERS)  (Preece et al., 2018)  and the Positive and Negative Affect Schedule (PANAS)  (Crawford and Henry, 2004) .\n\nStage 2: Headline Annotation Annotators are provided with detailed guidelines (see Section A.4), adapted from  Bradley and Lang (2007) , which are accessible throughout the annotation process 2  . The annotation interface is built using the Potato annotation tool  (Pei et al., 2022) .\n\nWe then present annotators with news posts public Facebook pages of major UK outlets (see Table  6 ). For each news post screenshot (see Figure  8  for exact question wording), annotators provide five types of responses: Dimensional Emotion Ratings capture valence, arousal, and dominance on a Likert scale of 1-7 using the Self-Assessment Manikin (SAM)  (Bradley and Lang, 1994) . Discrete Emotion Classifications involve categorizing into one of Ekman's basic emotion  (Ekman, 1992) . Modality Influence assesses the relative influence of the image versus the text on their emotional response. Personal Relevance rates the headline's personal relevance. Sharing Likelihood measures the likelihood they would share the post. We randomize the order of the news posts.",

      "text": "We recruit our annotators from Prolific, a platform recognized for having high participant attention and comprehension  (Peer et al., 2022) . To further ensure data quality, we implement several procedural checks.\n\nAnnotators are required to spend at least 2 minutes on the instruction page (enforced by not showing the continuation button until 2 minutes' time). The average time spent reviewing the instructions is 4.67 minutes, suggesting reasonable engagement beyond the minimum requirement.\n\nWe incorporate a comprehension check at the very beginning of the annotation task. Specifically, we present an excerpt from the annotation manual and ask two questions to see whether the annotators can actually understand our task. Those who fail to answer either one correctly are not allowed to proceed.\n\nWe include two attention check questions in our annotation job. Only 7 out of 291 annotators (2.4%) fail either one of these checks, with several contacting us afterward acknowledging their errors. While these annotators are not excluded in the analysis, their IDs are flagged, allowing dataset users to filter them if desired.\n\nTo empirically validate that annotators understand and correctly apply the annotation guidelines and the annotation scales, we include three standardized Affective Norms for English Text (ANET) sentences as calibration items  (Bradley and Lang, 2007)  in the annotation. Comparing our annotators' ratings on these items to the original ANET norms (converted to a 7-point scale) provides a direct measure of their ability to use the SAM scales consistently with the established protocol. Due to ANET licensing restrictions, the specific sentences cannot be disclosed. Table  1  presents a comparison of mean scores and standard deviations.\n\nAs shown in Table  1 , VAD scores from our UKbased annotator pool demonstrate strong correspondence with the original US-based ANET norms for these standardized stimuli. Mean differences are generally minor (typically <0.5 on the 7-point scale). This close alignment indicates that our annotators understand and apply the SAM scales in a manner consistent with established psychometric standards. While minor variations are expected due to demographic differences between our diverse UK sample and the original US university student sample, the overall consistency validates the integrity of our collected affective ratings.",

Crucially, we have annotators from 97 out of 124 UK postcode areas, ensuring substantial geographic diversity within the UK. See Table  4  for a comprehensive breakdown of annotator characteristics.\n\nDistribution of Annotations Figure  7  presents the distributions of the collected annotation variables. Key observations include: The neutral value (4) is the most frequent for all three dimensions. As expected, the valence scores tend to skew negatively, arousal scores are predominantly high, and dominance scores skew slightly low. For discrete emotions, \"neutral\" is the most commonly selected emotion, followed by \"sad\". Interestingly, the next most frequent emotion is \"happy,\" which is likely due to the limitation of having only one category for positive emotions. Further details, including distributions for relevance, sharing likelihood, and modality influence, are available in Appendix Section A.5.1. Additionally, we analyze interannotator agreement in Section A.6, finding Krippendorff's α values comparable to existing emotion annotation datasets, with moderate agreement for valence (α = 0.468) and lower agreement for arousal (α = 0.145) and dominance (α = 0.203).",

We classify news post using zeroshot with Gemini 1.5 Pro (prompt in Section A.7). Figure  10  shows the topic distribution, and Figure  11  shows mean arousal per topic.

For each annotator, we reserve 32 of their annotated posts for potential few-shot demonstrations and utilize the remaining posts (579 samples total) for testing. For evaluation, we employ three complementary metrics that capture different aspects of prediction quality: Mean Absolute Error (MAE) to measure overall prediction accuracy, Exact Accuracy to identify precise matches with annotator ratings, and ±1 Accuracy (the percentage of predictions falling within one point of the ground truth) to account for the inherent subjectivity in emotional assessment by allowing slight variations.\n\nOur evaluation compares model predictions against each individual annotator's ratings.\n\nWe conduct experiments across seven frontier models, including both API-based models [Gemini 1.5 Pro  (Team et al., 2024) ,  GPT-4o (Hurst et al., 2024 ), Grok-2 (xAI, 2025) ] and open-weight models [Llama-3.2-90B-Vision (Meta AI, 2024a), Qwen2.5-VL-72B-Instruct (QwenLM, 2025), Llama-3.3-70B-Instruct  (Meta AI, 2024b) , Llama-3.1-405B-Instruct  (Meta AI, 2024c) ], with all except the last two capable of processing multimodal inputs. In rare cases where formatting or safety concerns prevents a model from generating a prediction, we assign -1 as the prediction to penalize such behavior. As we decode only a single token for the answer, temperature settings and sampling parameters are not relevant to this process.\n\nWe examine four input conditions. The text-only condition provides a detailed textual description of each news post, while the image-only condition uses the original news screenshot. We then augment each of these base conditions with persona information, creating text-with-persona and imagewith-persona conditions where annotator characteristics are incorporated into the system prompt. Since our annotators originally rated news screenshots, we leverage Gemini 1.5 Pro to generate comprehensive textual descriptions for the text-only conditions, enriching these with headline text and engagement metrics. The complete prompt templates and an illustrative news post image-text pair are provided in Sections A.11 and A.10, respectively. We present our zero-shot evaluation results in Table  3 .\n\nWhile persona variables provide valuable signals for personalization, they inevitably offer an incomplete view of individual preferences and behaviors, as the richness and complexity of human experience extends far beyond what can be captured through demographic and personality questionnaires  (Dong et al., 2024) . We hypothesize that incorporating behavioral data, specifically, an individual's prior annotations, could provide complementary information for modeling affective responses. To test this hypothesis, we conduct k-shot experiments (k ∈ {4, 8, 16, 32}) with and without persona information across both text and image modalities. Figure  3  presents the Exact Accuracy results for Gemini 1.5 Pro, our top-performing zeroshot model (complete results in Table  10  and Figure 13 ). Due to resource constraints, we are only able to conduct few-shot experiments with Gemini 1.5 Pro.",

      "text": "Current LLMs demonstrate reasonable default zero-shot alignment with UK annotators. Without personalization, models achieve seemingly en-couraging baseline performance with ±1 accuracy exceeding 70%. However, this metric alone can be misleading -a naive predictor that simply outputs the population mean would likely achieve similar ±1 accuracy given the roughly Gaussian distribution of arousal ratings (see Figure  7 ). The consistently low exact accuracy (< 40%) across all models provides a more stringent evaluation of true personalization capability. This substantial gap between ±1 and exact accuracy suggests that while models can broadly approximate the range of typical responses, they struggle to capture individual-specific variations in emotional reactions.\n\nIncorporating persona information consistently improves performance. The improvements are particularly large for Gemini 1.5 Pro, where persona information reduces MAE by 11.6% (1.034 → 0.914) for text input and 10.1% (0.936 → 0.841) for image input. These substantial gains demonstrate that current LLMs can effectively leverage explicit persona variables to better simulate individual annotators, validating our persona variable collection strategy. This result aligns with prior work on the effectiveness of persona prompting  (Rescala et al., 2024; Dong et al., 2024; Hu and Collier, 2024) .\n\nImage inputs consistently outperform textual inputs. Our analysis reveals a clear advantage for image-based prediction across all vision-language models except Llama-3.2-90B-Vision. The optimal performance is achieved by Gemini 1.5 Pro with image input and persona information (MAE: 0.841, ±1 Accuracy: 82.04%), surpassing the best textonly configuration from Llama-3.1-405B-Instruct (MAE: 0.885, ±1 Accuracy: 81.17%). This superiority of visual inputs aligns with prior working documenting stronger affective responses to images versus text in psychology and communication literature  (Iyer and Oldmeadow, 2006; Powell et al., 2015) . Even our high-quality textual descriptions (example in Section A.10), appear unable to fully capture the affective richness encoded in visual stimuli. This observation is echoed by annotators who report particularly intense emotional reactions to images of suffering or tragedy (see Section A.9.2).\n\nModels exhibit varying degrees of steerability through persona prompting. Gemini 1.5 Pro, Grok-2, Qwen2.5-VL-72B-Instruct and the Llama family show high responsiveness to persona information, while GPT-4o maintains more consistent behavior with and without persona information. This variation suggests fundamental differences in these models' capacity for steerably pluralistic alignment  (Sorensen et al., 2024) .",

      "text": "Few-shot learning demonstrates a consistent pattern of initial performance degradation followed by gradual recovery. For both text and image modalities, we observe performance drop when transitioning from zero-shot to 4-shot setting. Performance gradually recovers with increasing demonstrations, with text-input models surpassing zero-shot performance at 8 shots (no persona) or 16 shots (with persona), continuing to improve up to 32 shots. However, the image modality shows a sharper initial decline and slower recovery, only matching zero-shot performance at 32 shots for exact accuracy and still lagging in ±1 Accuracy and MAE. This initial deterioration aligns with the early ascent (in terms of risk) phenomenon in in-context learning  (Lin and Lee, 2024; Agarwal et al., 2024) , where models initially struggle to effectively integrate limited demonstrations. We hypothesize that the inherent subjectivity and noise in emotional arousal annotations may exacerbate this effect, leading to overfitting with sparse examples before models learn to extract robust user-specific patterns.\n\nPersona information provides consistent benefits across few-shot regimes. Even at 32 shot, persona information yields substantial improvements (text: MAE 0.812 → 0.782, accuracy 0.421 → 0.444; image: MAE 0.926 → 0.858, accuracy 0.392 → 0.428). This persistent benefit suggests that explicit persona information captures complementary signals to those learned from demonstration examples. Drawing parallels to recommender systems literature, our few-shot approach is analogous to item-based recommendation, while persona prompting resembles natural-language-based recommendation  [See Sanner et al. (2023)  for an overview]. Our results contribute to this line of research by demonstrating the potential value of hybrid approaches: while past behavior reveals specific preferences, persona information provides a broader context that may not be readily inferable from a limited set of behavioral examples.\n\nImage few-shot prompting scales worse than text, despite zero-shot advantages. While image inputs yield the best zero-shot performance, they exhibit both steeper initial performance degradation and more limited few-shot scaling compared to text inputs. Despite showing consistent improvements with additional demonstrations, image performance does not surpass the zero-shot level even at 32 shots. This pattern likely reflects both the increased complexity of visual processing and limitations of current vision-language models in few-shot learning scenarios. Although images contain the complete information available to human annotators, current VLMs appear unable to fully leverage this rich visual information in few-shot contexts, suggesting an area for future work.  Platform Coverage. We focused our data collection on Facebook posts, as Facebook remains the dominant social media news source in the UK as of 2024  (Ofcom, 2024b) . While platform-specific effects may exist, our findings provide valuable insights into how users engage with news on a major distribution channel. Future work could extend this analysis to other platforms to understand platformspecific effects.\n\nData Quality Although we implemented multiple quality control measures (attention checks, Captcha verification) and used Prolific's platform, which claims to provide 100% genuine human participants 3 , we cannot completely rule out the possibility of AI-generated responses. Our modeling results support the high quality of the collected annotations, though as with any large-scale annotation effort, maintaining perfect attention throughout all responses cannot be guaranteed.",

      "text": "We conducted a pilot study to determine whether to use full Facebook news post screenshots or text-only headlines as stimuli. This decision involves several trade-offs. Text-only stimuli are simpler to process with current language models and sufficient for many breaking news posts that use generic images. However, full screenshots offer greater ecological validity, as social media users typically encounter both text and images simultaneously. Prior research suggests that visual stimuli are processed more rapidly than text  (Azizian et al., 2006)  and are more memorable  (Shepard, 1967) , though current open-source vision-language models still face significant performance and robustness challenges  (Li et al., 2024; Sterz et al., 2024) .\n\nTo empirically inform this decision, we collect annotations from 40 UK-based participants (20 per condition) for 10 paired news posts from March 2024, present either as textonly headlines or full screenshots. Participants rated valence, arousal, and dominance (VAD) and provide discrete emotion categories.\n\nWe then analyze the aggregated ratings across all 10 posts for each condition. Table  5  presents the descriptive and inferential statistics for the dimensional emotions (VAD). Mann-Whitney U tests indicate significant differences in valence (p = 0.016) and dominance (p = 0.019), though with small effect sizes (RBC ranging from -0.032 to -0.136). For discrete emotions, a chi-square test indicates marginally significant differences in emotion distribution between conditions (χ 2 = 14.93, p = 0.060). We additionally visually show the distribution of VAD and discrete ratings in Figures  4  and 5 .\n\nThe distribution patterns of VAD and discrete ratings are visualized in Figures  4  and 5 . While VAD distributions remain broadly similar across conditions, the image condition elicits more negative valence ratings and more neutral dominance ratings. The differences in discrete emotion ratings are more noticeable, with substantially fewer neutral emotions reported in the image condition. We interpret this as evidence that images help disambiguate emotional content -since the image condition includes both visual and textual information, it may provide richer context for emotional interpretation.\n\nBased on these findings and theoretical considerations, we decide to use full screenshots for our main study. This choice is driven by observed differences in emotional annotations, the ecological validity of multimodal news consumption on social media, and the additional contextual information provided by images. While current vision-language models face technical limitations, we anticipate rapid advancement in multimodal processing capabilities and prioritize capturing more naturalistic news consumption experiences over immediate computational convenience.",

However, our data also present notable deviations. Specifically, we observe a higher concentration of headlines exhibiting elevated arousal levels (above 6) in both the first and second quadrants (low valence/high arousal and high valence/high arousal, respectively). This concentration is particularly pronounced in the second quadrant, characterized by very low valence and very high arousal.

Finally, the overall distribution in our dataset encompasses a broader region of the valence-arousal space compared to that of  Kurdi et al. (2017) .

Is it more the case that some specific persona variables explain the vast majority of variance or is it rather spread out across all variables? To answer this question, we analyze the Persona model and calculated the Eta-squared (η 2 ), a commonly used measure representing the proportion of the total variance in the dependent variable accounted for by a given independent variable. The calculations are performed using the effectsize package (Ben-Shachar et al., 2020) in R.\n\nBased on effect sizes, the individual contributions of the persona variables to explaining variance in arousal are generally modest. The majority of persona variables have small effect sizes, below 0.005. We show the top 10 persona variable with highest effect sizes in Table  9 . Despite this overall trend, a subset of variables exhibit somewhat larger effect sizes. These included factors related to socioeconomic status, such as personal income (η 2 = 0.010) and education level (η 2 = 0.008), as well as employment status (η 2 = 0.008). Personality traits also demonstrate notable influence, particularly Agreeableness (η 2 = 0.009) and Neuroticism (η 2 = 0.008). Among media consumption patterns, television viewing habits stand out (η 2 = 0.008), while current emotional state also show meaningful effects (η 2 = 0.007).\n\nThese findings suggest that while the regression model as a whole demonstrates a reasonable ability to predict arousal (as indicated by the R 2 values discussed previously), the influence of individual persona variables is, for the most part, limited. The observed model fit likely stems from the cumulative effect of numerous variables with small individual contributions. This pattern aligns with the complex, multifaceted nature of affective responses to news content, where multiple personal characteristics interact to shape individual reactions (also see the quantitative interview analysis in Section A.9. The distributed nature of these effects underscores the importance of considering a broad spectrum of persona variables in modeling affective responses, rather than focusing on a limited set of characteristics.",

To understand the relative importance of these factors, we first The Outlet and Topic models, which incorporate static content features, achieve similar total explanatory power (conditional R 2 ) to the Persona model but with higher fixed-effect contributions (marginal R 2 ). This suggests these contentbased features capture some of the variance previously attributed to random effects, without improving overall prediction. In contrast, the Calibration model shows higher total explanatory power (R 2 = 0.328 vs. 0.286), indicating that annotators' annotation behavior on the calibration items may potentially capture variance unexplained by our carefully selected persona variables.\n\nThe All model, despite incorporating numerous fixed effects, maintains approximately the same conditional R 2 as the Calibration model. However, it demonstrates a substantial shift in R 2 distribution, with marginal R 2 reaching 0.261-exceptional for annotator modeling in NLP  (Hu and Collier, 2024) . Notably, we achieve better conditional R 2 compared to the User model (random-effects only), which only includes random intercepts for text stimuli. This improvement likely stems from two factors: first, the inherently conservative nature of random-effects fitting, which employs regularization to prevent overfitting; and second, random effects' limitation in capturing structural information within the data. While random effects excel at modeling individual-level variation, they treat such variation as purely stochastic, potentially overlooking systematic patterns that our comprehensive set of fixed effects can capture. Our results demonstrate that affective responses to news content, though complex, exhibit structural patterns that can be systematically modeled through carefully selected persona variables, including demographic characteristics, psychological traits, and news consumption behaviors.",

This framework suggests that while considerable behavioral variability exists within each individual, the parameters of these distributions may be stable across. In our case, this means that while a person's affective responses to news may vary substantially across different stories, their pattern of variation itself could be characteristic and predictable.

Personal relevance emerges as another crucial content factor, with annotators responding more intensely to news that mirrors their experiences or aligns with their values.

One annotator, highlighting their distrust of certain outlets, states that they avoid tabloids because they are \"just nonsense really, proper biased\" while another express a general suspicion of Facebook posts, viewing the platform as more for social interaction than trustworthy news.

The first group reports that source credibility significantly influence their emotional engagement, with one noting they \"don't get as worked up about stories from dodgy sources.\" The second group emphasizes prioritizing content over source, with one explaining they \"only consider the content, not the publisher.\"\n\nA.9.5 Q5\n\nReflecting on the most salient factors shaping their emotional responses (Q5), annotators frequently emphasize an interplay of several key elements. Personal background such as upbringing and professional experience emerge as particularly important. Similar numbers of annotations mention news content, with annotators particularly responsive to stories involving injustice, vulnerable populations (especially children), and issues of immediate personal relevance. One annotator powerfully illustrate this interaction between these two factors, explaining how \"growing up working class\" might have instilled a certain resilience, yet emphasizing that this does not diminish their emotional response to the suffering of innocent individuals, especially children. The perceived credibility of news sources is also a factor, with one annotator articulating how \"I take proper news sources more seriously.\" The presentation style of news content -including emotional language, imagery, and formatting -also influence responses, with several annotators demonstrating awareness of \"sensationalised\" content and clickbait tactics. Notably, these factors often operate interactively rather than in isolation.",

      "text": "Finally, when considering their experience with the annotation task itself (Q6), many annotators report that the task heighten their awareness of emotional responses to news. Some note that the annotation process make them more consciously aware of their emotional responses, prompting deeper reflection on the quality and factual nature of the news. As one annotator puts it, \"I found myself properly thinking about how each story affected me.\" Participants frequently discuss their news evaluation strategies, considering multiple factors including source credibility, visual elements, and headline framing. Notably, contrary to common assumptions about social media engagement, many annotators express reluctance to share news on social platforms, with one annotator stating that they \"don't share news on social media at all.\"\n\nThe responses reveal important individual differences in emotional engagement with news. Some annotators, particularly those identifying as neurodivergent, describe carefully managing their emotional engagement to avoid exhaustion, noting that news stories can trigger intense, lasting emotional responses. Others report preferring to reserve emotional energy for personal relationships rather than news content. Content preferences emerge as another key theme, with participants expressing greater interest in positive news, scientific developments, and locally relevant stories, while showing less engagement with celebrity news or sensationalized content.",

      "text": "While our qualitative analysis provides valuable insights, several methodological limitations warrant discussion. First, resource constraints necessitate written questionnaires rather than in-depth interviews, potentially limiting the nuance and richness of responses. Second, the opt-in nature of the interview participation may introduce selection bias, as annotators willing to provide detailed written responses might not fully represent our broader annotator population. Third, since the interviews are conducted after both the main annotation task and the persona variable survey, participants' responses might have been influenced by these prior experiences.\n\nThese design elements ultimately strengthen rather than compromise our findings. The post-task timing of the interviews prove advantageous, allowing annotators to develop more nuanced reflections on their annotation process and emotional responses. While our participants may represent more engaged annotators, their detailed accounts provide exactly the kind of rich, experiential data needed to complement our structured persona variables. The qualitative insights thus serve their intended purpose: providing crucial context that enriches our understanding of the quantitative patterns observed in our regression analysis.",

The shark is facing the camera and appears to be alive. The person holding the shark is slightly out of focus, with only the lower part of their face and body visible. The background is a blurry expanse of ocean. The BBC News logo is overlaid on the bottom left corner of the image. The text and image work together to tell the story of sharks testing positive for cocaine off the coast of Brazil. The image provides a visual representation of the subject matter, while the text gives context and further information. The visual element that grabs attention is the shark itself. Its size and proximity to the camera create a sense of immediacy and make the story feel more tangible. The contrast between the small, seemingly harmless shark and the serious implications of it testing positive for cocaine adds a layer of complexity to the image.",
