      "text": "In modern digital environments, users frequently express opinions on contentious topics, providing a wealth of information on prevailing attitudes. The systematic analysis of these opinions offers valuable insights for decision-making in various sectors, including marketing and politics. As a result, stance detection has emerged as a crucial subfield within affective computing, enabling the automatic detection of user stances in social media conversations and providing a nuanced understanding of public sentiment on complex issues. Recent years have seen a surge of research interest in developing effective stance detection methods, with contributions from multiple communities, including natural language processing, web science, and social computing. This paper provides a comprehensive survey of stance detection techniques on social media, covering task definitions, datasets, approaches, and future works. We review traditional stance detection models, as well as state-of-the-art methods based on large language models, and discuss their strengths and limitations. Our survey highlights the importance of stance detection in understanding public opinion and sentiment, and identifies gaps in current research. We conclude by outlining potential future directions for stance detection on social media, including the need for more robust and generalizable models, and the importance of addressing emerging challenges such as multi-modal stance detection and stance detection in low-resource languages.",

      "text": "The proliferation of social media platforms has revolutionized modern communication, transforming these platforms into a primary source of news and information for individuals. By facilitating user-generated content, these platforms enable individuals to articulate their opinions, share perspectives, and explore diverse facets of emerging topics  [1, 2] . The widespread adoption of social media has yielded a treasure trove of data for researchers to investigate various aspects of online human behavior, including the public's stance on social and political issues  [3] . Through the analysis and aggregation of user perspectives, researchers can identify dominant trends and opinions on polarizing topics. This vast repository of data holds significant potential for web mining and content analysis, with the insights gleaned from such analysis having far-reaching implications for decision-making processes, including advertising strategies and political elections  [4, 5] . Consequently, automated stance detection on social media has become a crucial aspect of opinion mining, enabling a more nuanced understanding of user attitudes towards a diverse range of issues  [6] .\n\nThe aim of stance detection is to determine the stance of a text's author towards a target, which can be an entity, concept, event, idea, opinion, claim, or topic that is either explicitly mentioned or implied within the text  [7, 8] . Early research on stance detection primarily focused on analyzing debates on online forums, which differs from more recent work that has emphasized social media platforms  [9] , particularly X (Twitter) 1 . Online forum debates typically have a clear, single context compared to social media platforms. In forum discussions, users engage in threaded conversations where information flow is usually focused on a specific topic. In contrast, social media discussions on a given topic are more dispersed, although they can sometimes be linked through hashtags 2 . However, social media platforms offer a wealth of additional features, such as user networks, which web science and computational social science researchers have utilized to develop stance detection techniques that do not rely solely on text  [10, 11] .\n\nRelated surveys. Recently, several research surveys on stance detection have been conducted. Zubiaga et al.  [12]  focused on stance detection in product reviews, with a particular emphasis on feature-level stance detection techniques. K üc ¸ük and Can  [13]  provided a comprehensive review of stance detection definitions, task classifications, and the relationships between stance detection and related subtasks, primarily focusing on natural language processing (NLP) based methods. AlDayel and Magdy  [14]  were the first to survey stance detection techniques for social media, covering not only NLP techniques but also network-level and multi-modal information, providing a more comprehensive overview of stance detection research in social media.\n\nOur motivation. In this paper, we present an overview of stance detection on social media and discuss promising research directions. The key motivations of this survey are summarized as follows:\n\n• Recent advances in stance detection have shown significant progress. However, existing surveys primarily concentrate on conventional approaches, including feature engineering, traditional neural networks, and early pretrained language models such as BERT. These reviews have not comprehensively analyzed the potential of emerging large language models (LLM), particularly the GPT family, in stance detection tasks. Therefore, to comprehensively survey and synthesize the state-ofthe-art, it is imperative to consolidate and distill these recent works. • The rapid evolution of social media has led to an increasing presence of multi-modal information and interactive patterns, rendering traditional text-based stance detection methods inadequate for these emerging contexts. In response, recent years have witnessed a proliferation of novel tasks specifically designed for social media, underscoring the need for a comprehensive review and synthesis of these advances. • Despite the promising potential of LLMs for stance detection, their application is still in an initial exploratory phase. Effective techniques to adapt and utilize these models for specific stance detection tasks remain an open research challenge. Moreover, the roles, background knowledge understanding, and biases of LLMs in stance detection contexts need to be further examined. Consequently, consolidating findings on these outstanding issues will provide significant motivation for authoring a new survey paper. • As LLM continues to advance, stance detection applications are expanding. While traditionally focused on sentence-level textual analysis, stance detection now shows potential for richer data types and settings. Moreover, new domains beyond text could benefit from stance detection. Looking ahead, it is necessary to discuss potential research directions that can improve stance detection and mitigation capabilities.\n\nMethodology for literature review. For our literature review, we conducted a search on Google Scholar, DBLP, and Web of Science using the keywords \"stance detection/prediction/classification\" and other related terms such as \"viewpoint\" and \"perspective\". We focused on studies where the search keywords were mentioned in the title or abstract. The search results were refined using various parameters, including the number of citations, year of publication, and the ranking of the journal or conference. We placed a special emphasis on venues related to NLP, computational social science, Web science, and information processing. The list of relevant studies was then inspected, and additional relevant studies were identified from the reference lists of those papers and the papers that cited them. We also conducted an extensive inspection of papers citing the SemEval 2016  [5]  stance detection task.\n\nThe remainder of this survey is structured as follows.\n\nSection 2 provides an overview of related tasks in stance detection. Section 3 presents datasets for stance detection under various tasks. We then review traditional stance detection methods in Section 4, tracing the technical development trajectory. Next, we introduce state-of-the-art stance detection methods based on LLMs in Section 5. Finally, we discuss the challenges faced by stance detection in the era of LLM in Section 6, as well as future research directions and potential development paths.",

      "text": "According to the literature, stance detection tasks can be categorized from two primary perspectives: data-centric and method development. From a data-centric perspective, stance detection encompasses several subtasks: targetspecific stance detection, multi-target stance detection, claim-based stance detection, conversational stance detection, multi-modal stance detection, and user-level stance detection. From a method development perspective, the tasks can be classified into in-target stance detection, crosstarget stance detection, zero-shot stance detection, and cross-lingual stance detection, each addressing different deployment scenarios and technical challenges.",

      "text": "From the perspectives of target types, data modalities, and categories, this section provides a detailed introduction to related tasks. Target-specific stance detection. The target-specific stance detection task is the most common task setting in the literature. In this paradigm, stance is inferred with respect to a predefined set of targets. Most previous studies have focused on this paradigm, including works such as Augenstein et al.  [15] , Darwish et al.  [16] , Igarashi et al.  [17] , Liu and Zhang  [18] , and Mohammad et al.  [5] . In this approach, the input text is used to predict the stance towards a specific, predefined single target.\n\nMulti-target stance detection. Building on the foundation of target-specific stance detection, the multi-target stance detection task addresses the scenario where a single tweet may contain multiple related targets. This task involves predicting the stance polarity of multiple targets within the same tweet (or statement). The concept of multitarget stance detection is commonly used to analyze the relationships between multiple targets, which often exhibit strong correlations, such as multiple candidates in a political election  [33, 41, 53] .\n\nClaim-based stance detection. In contrast to targetspecific stance detection, which focuses on explicit entities or topics, claim-based stance detection involves analyzing the stance towards a specific claim or news article. The primary objective is to determine the stance of comments responding to the news, whether they confirm or challenge the claim's validity. The prediction labels typically take the form of confirming or denying the claim. Claim-based stance detection is a crucial approach for evaluating the veracity of misinformation. By leveraging the stance of replies to predict the claim's veracity  [34] , this method has been recognized as a key technique for rumor and fake news      [12] , highlighting its importance in assessing the credibility of online information. Conversational stance detection. In the domain of social media analysis, users frequently express their opinions within conversational threads. However, traditional stance detection techniques often struggle to accurately identify stances in such dialogic environments due to their limited ability to understand contextual nuances. To address this limitation, coversational-based stance detection tasks have been proposed  [43] . Typically, these tasks involve predicting the stance polarity of a given tweet (or statement) based on the conversation history, the current tweet (or statement), and the stance target.\n\nMulti-modal stance detection. With the rapid evolution of social media, users increasingly express their opinions not only through text, but also through diverse multimedia content, such as audio, images, videos, and emojis.\n\nTo address this trend, multi-modal stance detection has emerged as a research area, aiming to predict stance polarity by integrating various data forms, including text, images, videos, and audio.\n\nUser-level stance detection. The user-level stance detection task involves predicting a user's stance towards a given topic. In this context, various user attributes can be integrated with the text of their posts to enhance the predictive model  [14, 54] . Notably, most studies in this area have adopted a binary classification approach, categorizing users' stances into two polarized classes: support and against  [16] . This simplification is often justified by the assumption that users will exhibit a clear stance, even if their posts appear neutral.",

      "section_name": "Method Development Perspective",
      "text": "From a method development perspective, this section provides a detailed introduction to several task categorization approaches.\n\nIn-target stance detection. In the early stages of stance detection research, the in-target stance detection task was the most extensively studied task. This task is closely related to the development of text classification techniques. The intarget stance detection task involves training and inferring stance detection models on the same target. Over the years, a large body of work has focused on this task, exploring various approaches and methodologies. The task is formally defined as:\n\nrepresent the labeled data collection, where x refers to the input text and q corresponds to the target. N denotes the total number of instances in X. Each sentence-target pair (x, q) ∈ X is assigned a stance label y. In-target stance detection aims to predict the stance label for x towards target q.\n\nCross-target stance detection. In real-world applications, obtaining rich annotated data for each target is a time-consuming and labor-intensive process. Conventional stance detection methods struggle to generalize well across targets. Cross-target stance detection  [55]  aims to infer the attitude towards a target by leveraging a large amount of annotated data from another target. Typically, most works in this area focus on targets within the same domain, such as Trump and Hillary in the politics domain. However, some studies also explore cross-domain stance detection, where the source and target domains differ, such as training on Trump data and inferring stance on feminist movement data. This approach enables the model to generalize stance detection across different domains and contexts. The task is formally defined as:\n\ni=1 denote the labeled dataset in the source domain, where each tuple (x s i , q s i ) consists of an input text x s i and its corresponding target q s i . The dataset contains N s instances, each associated with a stance label y s . Given an input sentence x d and a target q d in the target domain, the goal of cross-target stance detection is to predict the stance label for x d towards q d by leveraging the model learned from the labeled data X s in the source domain.\n\nZero-shot stance detection. In real-world applications, test data often involves unseen targets during training. As a special case of cross-target stance detection, the zeroshot stance detection Task involves training a model on annotated data from a specific target and directly predicting the stance on unseen targets. Pioneering work by Allaway and McKeown  [25]  first introduced the zero-shot stance detection task and proposed the VAST dataset, which contains a large number of targets with no overlap between training and testing targets. Furthermore, some studies have begun to explore open-domain zero-shot stance detection, aiming to simulate real-world scenarios and reduce the need for training samples. The task is formally defined as:\n\ni=1 denote the labeled dataset in the source domain, where each tuple (x s i , q s i ) consists of an input text x s i and its corresponding target q s i .\n\ni=1 denote a set of unlabeled instances towards unseen or testing targets. Note that there is no overlap between X s and X d . The aim of zero-shot stance detection is to train a model from each sentence x s i towards the source known target q s i from X s , and infer the stance polarity for each sentence x d i towards an unseen target q d i in X d .\n\nCross-lingual stance detection. In today's globalized world, understanding and analyzing stances in multiple languages is crucial, particularly given the linguistic diversity of online platforms such as social media, forums, and news websites. However, traditional monolingual stance detection methods often fall short in multilingual applications due to language and cultural variations. This has led to the development of multilingual stance detection tasks, which aim to expand the scope and applicability of stance detection research  [50] . The task is formally defined as:\n\ni=1 denote the labeled dataset in the source language, where each tuple (x s i , q s i , l s i ) consists of an input text x s i , its corresponding target q s i , and the language label l s i . X t = (x t i , q t i , l t i )\n\nN t i=1 denote a set of unlabeled instances in the target language. Note that there is no overlap between X s and X t , and l s i ̸ = l t i . The aim of cross-lingual stance detection is to train a model from each sentence (x s i towards the source known target q s i from X s , and infer the stance polarity for each sentence x t i towards an unseen target q t i in X t , despite the language difference between l s i and l t i .",

First, a feature identifier is constructed to recognize important features, followed by the development of a traditional machine learning model to achieve classification and prediction. The mainstream methods can be broadly categorized into several types, including Support Vector Machines (SVMs), logistic regression, decision trees, and k-Nearest Neighbors (KNN). Among these methods, SVMs are the most widely employed approach for stance detection. They have been used in over 40 studies, either as the primary approach or as a baseline for comparison with other methods. Notable examples of studies that have utilized SVMs for stance detection include  [10] ,  [60] , and  [61] .\n\nLogistic regression is another popular approach for stance detection, appearing in over 15 studies. This method has been used in various forms, including as a standalone classifier and as part of an ensemble classifier. Examples of studies that have employed logistic regression for stance detection include  [34] ,  [62] , and  [63] .\n\nDecision trees and random forests are also commonly used approaches for stance detection. Decision trees have been employed in several studies, including  [10]  and  [64] . Random forests, which are ensemble classifiers based on decision trees, have been used in studies such as  [11]  and  [65] .\n\nFinally, artificial neural networks (ANNs) have also been applied to stance detection tasks.

Attention-based approaches have garnered significant attention, with notable examples including the combination of LSTM and attention mechanisms, as well as CNNs with attention mechanisms  [79, 85] .

As a result, PLMs have gained considerable attention in stance detection research. One effective approach is fine-tuning, which involves reformatting the input tweet and target into a new format, such as \"<CLS> Tweet <SEP> Target\", and then feeding it into a PLM to obtain the hidden state vector at the CLS position. This is followed by designing a loss function and training the model using labeled samples through backpropagation. The basic structure is shown in Fig.  3 .\n\nTo enhance the applicability of PLMs in stance detection, some methods draw inspiration from the pre-training process of PLMs and retrain the PLM on additional social media data. For example, He et al.  [90]  retrained a PLM on social media tweet data. Another approach is to use frozen PLM parameters, which is a common method due to its efficiency and minimal computational overhead. By adjusting a small portion of the model parameters and keeping the remaining parameters unchanged, PLMs can adapt to stance detection tasks while minimizing computational costs and data requirements  [99, 100, 104] . This method typically involves adding additional neural network layers Some studies have also combined PLMs with traditional neural networks, such as RNNs and CNNs, to leverage the strengths of both approaches  [4, 43] . Furthermore, incorporating attention mechanisms with fine-tuning methods has been shown to significantly improve stance detection performance, leading to a large body of work focused on customizing attention mechanisms to address specific problems.

This approach enables the prediction of user stance without requiring training samples or further model training, making model deployment more efficient.\n\nZero-shot prompt method: Zhang et al.

      "text": "Augmenting data and existing approaches with enhanced external knowledge and analytical prowess.\n\nSeveral studies argue that even LLMs often lack sufficient domain-specific knowledge to complete tasks, and the world knowledge embedded in LLMs can become outdated over time. Therefore, some works explore using sample prompts to elicit stance detection-related knowledge from LLMs, and then combine it with traditional deep learning methods, fine-tuning methods, or prompt-tuning methods to improve stance detection accuracy. We refer to this approach as LLM-enhanced fine-tuning methods  [107] [108] [109] . This type of method typically involves at least two stages: first, it uses prompt learning to acquire relevant background knowledge; then, it inputs the acquired knowledge along with the original text into a trainable stance detection model. This approach effectively combines the reasoning capabilities of LLMs with the learning capabilities of annotated samples, enhancing the model's zero-shot learning ability.\n\nIn the work of Li et al.  [97] , in addition to directly prompting the model to acquire background knowledge and subsequently feeding it into the LLM to obtain the final stance (as mentioned above), the authors also proposed a fine-tuning approach in the second stage. Specifically, the extracted background knowledge is combined with the input tweet and target, and then fed into the fine-tuning method, which leverages labeled samples to learn through backpropagation.\n\nThe MPPT method  [108]  further expands the utilization of LLM knowledge by leveraging the CoT approach to extract the LLM's analysis of different perspectives on a target. Fig.  8  shows the framework. For example, for the target \"Trump\", the analysis perspectives might include \"politician, president, and Republican party member, etc.\". These perspectives can be regarded as domain-invariant knowledge that can be transferred to other targets, such as \"Hillary\". By incorporating the perspective information into the prompt-based fine-tuning method, MPPT enhances the accuracy and generalizability of stance detection across multiple targets.\n\nKAI  [107]  further extends the idea of leveraging LLMs to enhance reasoning by explicitly representing the logic of stance prediction using first-order logic rules. It is then Fig.  8 : Framework of MPPT  [108] . Fig.  9 : Framework of KAI  [107] . combined with fine-tuning methods to improve the interpretability and accuracy of stance detection. Fig.  9  shows the framework. EDDA  [98]  expands the generality of stance detection tasks by proposing a data augmentation-based approach. Using first-order logic rules as the foundation for data augmentation, EDDA generates new tweet-category sample pairs through prompt-based learning. Furthermore, by incorporating first-order logic rules as external knowledge, EDDA significantly improves the accuracy of current stance detection methods when combined with traditional fine-tuning models.",

The goal of user-level stance detection is to capture and analyze users' overall attitudes across multiple interactions, rather than just a single text. This is particularly important for brand management, political analysis, and social movement research, as it can reveal changes in user attitudes and underlying trends. By understanding users' overall stances, we can more accurately predict their future behavior and decision-making. However, achieving this goal is challenging. Data collection and privacy protection are significant hurdles, as user data is often scattered across multiple platforms and subject to strict privacy policies. Additionally, users' expressed stances may be inconsistent due to contextual changes, requiring complex models that can capture these changes.

Developing debiased datasets and model training methods is essential but challenging. The hallucination problem in LLMs, where they generate inaccurate or false information, is a key challenge. This can lead to incorrect stance detection results, affecting decision-making. Ensuring the reliability and accuracy of large model outputs is the first step in mitigating this issue. Researchers need to incorporate mechanisms into model training to detect and correct these hallucinations. Debiasing methods in LLMs require special attention. While developing debiased datasets is one direction, it is difficult to achieve complete debiasing due to the massive scale of LLMs. Therefore, research should focus on the model training process, adopting dynamic adjustment and debiasing algorithms that can identify and adjust biased outputs in real-time, providing more fair results. Moreover, transparency and explainability are crucial in LLMs. Due to their complexity, understanding their decision-making processes is a challenge. Developing tools and methods to explain model decisions can help users trust and accept model outputs.
