      "text": "Research and developments in speaker recognition systems have resulted in a vast range of acceptance in several fields such as banking, forensic authorization and security applications in neutral talking condition  [1] ,  [2] . However, the system performance degrades in noisy and emotional talking conditions  [3] . The challenges of designing a system which can offer a high performance in the midst of a noisy interference signal and in emotional talking conditions have been identified as the main objectives of this paper.\n\nSpeech is considered to be the primary communication system  [4] . An effective communication system consists of both a linguistic and an emotional/stressful part  [5] . The emotional/stressful aspect of human communication systems is inevitable in any Human-Machine interaction system. Speaker identification in emotional and noisy talking conditions can be used to offer a promising future for the banking sector, smart customer support, and forensic applications  [6, 7] .\n\nIn natural conditions, speech undergoes various kinds of interference, such as surface reflections, reverberations, noise from other sources, and so on  [8] . These interferences, which are present in the dominant speech signal, may reduce the system's performance at the application level  [9] . For example, a bank security system using speaker identification may fail to work in noisy conditions. This is because the system does not have the ability to separate the dominant original signal from other noisy signals. Humans have the ability to separate the dominant signal even in the presence of noise, and this ability is referred to as Auditory Scene Analysis (ASA)  [10] . ASA is accomplished by the combined efforts of the human auditory and intelligence systems. The system performance can be improved by the incorporation of computationally developed ASA for machines. Therefore, they can separate the dominant signal from other forms of interference before verification by means of Computational Auditory Scene Analysis (CASA)  [11] . Our proposed model show promising results in comparison with other classifiers such as Support Vector Machine (SVM) and Multilayer Perceptron (MLP).\n\nThese days organizations, industries and several homes are equipped with security devices such as surveillance cameras. These devices can capture sounds of the surroundings. They may capture the voice of predators even in noisy and emotional conditions. The recorded voice can be an input to the proposed system, and this can be used by police in criminal investigations to identify a potential criminal for example. Four distinct speech datasets have been included in this work to assess the proposed model.\n\nThe implementation of emotion recognition, along with noise suppression is of great importance in the development of speaker identification techniques for successful implementation of an effective human-machine interaction system. Shao and Wang  [12]  studied acoustic features and investigated a general solution to achieve a robust speaker identification system under noisy environments. They proposed state of the art speakerdependent features obtained from auditory filtering and cepstral analysis. These auditory features were further enhanced, by means of binary time-frequency (T-F) masks produced by a CASA system, and their reconstruction uncertainties were estimated for better computation of speaker likelihood. Results demonstrated that their proposed Gammatone Frequency Cepstral Coefficients (GFCCs) features perform significantly better than the traditional Mel-Frequency Cepstral Coefficients (MFCC) features. Ghiurcau et al.  [13]  evaluated the impact of speaker emotional features upon text-independent speaker recognition systems by means of MFCCs, for feature extraction, and the SVM model, for classification. Experimental tests were performed on the Berlin emotional speech database. Results demonstrated that emotions play a vital role in minimizing the performance of speaker identification systems compared to when these same words were spoken neutrally. Zhao et al.  [14]  studied speaker identification performance under noisy environments. The authors first presented a new speaker feature, called gammatone frequency cepstral coefficient (GFCC) and demonstrated that this auditory feature picks up seizures acoustic characteristics pertinent to the speaker and performs noticeably better than the conventional speaker features under noisy conditions. At a later stage, the authors applied CASA separation and then reconstructed or marginalized the deteriorated constituents, specified by the CASA mask. They found out that both reconstruction and marginalization are effective. Li et al.  [15]  proposed a novel architecture to enhance the robustness in emotion-dependent speaker recognition/identification systems. In fact, they proposed a new learning technology to reweight the probability of test affective utterances at the pitch envelop level. Experiments were carried out upon the Mandarin Affective Speech dataset and results yielded an enhancement of 8% of identification performance rate over the conventional speaker recognition schemes. Patnala and Prasad  [16]  proposed a novel scheme in order to enhance speaker identification performance under the existence of fused effects of additive noise and room reverberations, which together present a significant challenge to building robust solutions to related systems. The authors proposed a system solution with the aim of resolving the aforementioned matter using two steps. The first step was the preprocessing of the audio signal corrupted by noise and room reverberations using binary time-frequency (T-F) masking algorithm, using a CASA approach, via a deep neural network classifier. Mansour et al.  [17]  employed the i-vector approach along with the Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier as an attempt to boost and enhance the deteriorated performance of speaker recognition under emotional auditory environments. Results showed that the i-vector algorithm resolves the problem of training algorithm complexity that the SVM model suffers from and shows promising results in increasing speaker recognition performance in an emotional context. Islam et al.  [18]  proposed a state of the art neural-response-based method for a speaker identification system under noisy acoustic conditions using 2-D neurograms coefficients, which are coefficients built upon reactions of a physiologically-based computational model of the auditory periphery. The classification accuracies of the proposed model were compared to the performances of the traditional speaker identification methodologies using features such as \"MFCCs, GFCC) and Frequency domain linear prediction (FDLP)\". The identification results attained by the proposed method were comparable to the performance of those conventional approaches in quiet settings, but the new feature has demonstrated lower classification error rates under noisy environments.\n\nFaragallah  [19]  advocated a speaker identification system, that is resistant to noise, named MKMFCC-SVM. This system is based on the \"Multiple Kernel Weighted Mel Frequency Cepstral Coefficient (MKMFCC) and support vector machine (SVM)\". A comparison was made between the performance of the proposed \"MKMFCC-SVM and the MFCC-SVM\" speaker identification systems. Results revealed that the proposed MKMFCC-SVM system produces better identification rates in the presence of noise. Korba et al.  [20]  stated that MFCC features are deemed very sensitive in the presence of background conditions, which has a considerable negative impact on the performance of speaker identification systems. The authors combined the features they obtained with MFCC features. Their speaker identification system was implemented on the GMM using TIMIT speech corpus. The results of their method of implementation and testing were increased up to 28% accuracy at signal to noise ratio (SNR) 5 dB. Ayhan and Kwan  [21]  developed a vigorous speaker identification scheme under noisy conditions which implicates \"mask estimation, gammatone features with bounded marginalization to deal with unreliable features, and Gaussian mixture model (GMM) for speaker identification\". Evaluation and assessments were performed to determine the speaker identification performance of the proposed algorithm, and results showed that it substantially outperforms the conventional method MFCC with Cepstral Mean Normalization (MFCC-CMN) at low signal-to-noise conditions. Nasr et al.  [22]  proposed a new framework to enhance speaker identification accuracy based on \"Cepstral features and the Normalized Pitch Frequency (NPF)\". The novel approach used a neural classifier with a single hidden layer node as well as a pre-processing noise reduction step prior to the feature extraction procedure in order to enlarge and enhance the identification performance.\n\nThere are several limitations in the related work. Much of the literature on this subject attempted to propose groundbreaking approaches and pioneering methodologies with the aim of enhancing speaker identification accuracy under noisy as well as emotional environments. Some authors used the conventional MFCC features  [13] ,  [23] ; while some others introduced novel acoustic features such as GFCCs features  [12]  and 2-D neurograms coefficients  [18] . Some scholars favored examining the use of CASA modules in noisy speech, in conjunction with one of the above-mentioned acoustic features, and results showed substantial improvement in identification performance in some cases. Moreover, many studies used the conventional classifiers, such as SVMs  [13] , GMMs  [18] ,  [21]  and HMMs  [23] [24] [25]  , while many recent work explored the DNN-based classifiers  [16] ,  [26] .\n\nThe aim of this study is to introduce a novel algorithm for speaker identification in real-world applications. Speech processing modules are susceptible to noise and interference in natural environments. This reduces the system's performance in real world applications. In contrast, the proposed algorithm can identify the speaker in noisy and emotional talking conditions. The proposed algorithm incorporates a CASA pre-processing module for noise suppression and cascaded GMM-CNN classifier for emotion recognition and speaker identification.\n\nTo the best of our knowledge, none of the former studies has considered the usage of CASA preprocessing module and MFCC-based feature extraction in combination with hybrid cascaded DNNbased classifier, such as GMM-CNN classifier, in order to boost text-independent speaker identification systems under noisy and emotional talking conditions.",

The speech tokens were sampled at a frequency of 8 kHz using 16 bits A/D converter.

In deep learning, CNN models are part of deep neural networks (DNN). CNN classifiers are applicable in acoustic signal processing, as well as other applications. The CNN classifier is used for the precise identification of the target speaker, followed by the GMM classification. A 50-layer Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) is employed for classification. Each convolutional layer is followed by a maxpooling layer. The fully connected layers use GMM tags to tune the final result from the CNN classifier. For every input at the fully connected layers, the system evaluates the GMM tag value in order to filter the results at the output stage. The decision will be a binary 0 or 1 based on the GMM tag.\n\nThis paper uses a CNN with fifty hidden layers in addition to input and output layers.

To evaluate the proposed algorithm, evaluation metrics such as Speaker Identification Performance (SID), Precision, Recall, F1 score and Area Under the Curve (AUC) metrics have been used.\n\nThe results show that every model functions almost ideally in neutral talking conditions. The proposed GMM-CNN model outperforms all other models using the SUSAS dataset and based on the performance evaluation metrics reported in Equations 20 to 23  [50] :\n\n\"Totalnumber of times the unknown speaker has been identified correctly\" SID Performance 100% \"Totalnumber of trials\" =\n\nWhere \"TP, TN, FP and FN are the True Positive, True Negative, False Positive and False Negative values, respectively are obtained from the confusion matrix.\"\n\nThe average text-independent speaker identification in each of neutral and emotional/stressful environments using the SUSAS dataset in view of each of CASA-based GMM-CNN, GMM-CNN, SVM and MLP is 84.49%, 80.45%, 76.77% and 77.24%, respectively as illustrated in Figure  4 . This shows that the CASA-based GMM-CNN model outperforms other models using SUSAS database. Moreover, the highest and lowest SIDS are reported for Neutral and Angry, respectively and this is consistent with prior work. In order to confirm our results, statistical tests should be used to check if the CASA-based GMM-CNN is statistically different from other models. Before we use a proper statistical test, we have to check the distribution of the SID Performance. Using the Kolmogorov-Smirnov normality test, we found that SID Performance is not normally distributed, so we have to use non-parametric tests  [51] . The Wilcoxon test  [51] , which is a non-parametric test was used to compare two models. Based on the results, we notice that the proposed CASA-based GMM-CNN is statistically different from other models based on 90% confidence level. Hence, we can confirm that the CASA-,\n\nbased GMM-CNN model surpasses other models and it is also statistically different from other models.\n\nIn order to generalize the validity of the proposed model, we conducted six additional experiments to assess the speaker identification performance achieved in neutral and emotional/stressful conditions using the CASA-based GMM-CNN classification algorithm. These experiments are:   Experiment 2: Another assessment of the proposed CASA-based GMM-CNN using the SUSAS database has been conducted using ten nonprofessional audience members (human judges). Overall, thirty speech samples are used in this experiment. During the testing stage, the speech samples were mixed with noise signals in a ratio 2:1. Figure  6  illustrates that the \"human listener performance\" is close to the proposed CASA-based GMM-CNN system.\n\nExperiment 3: The proposed system was also evaluated by using a private Arabic Emirati-accented dataset. In this experiment, a \"32-dimension feature analysis of MFCCs (16 static MFCCs and 16 delta MFCCs) was utilized to find the observation vectors in CASA-based GMM-CNN\".    This experiment evaluates the proposed system performance using angry, happy, neutral, sad, fearful, disgust, calm and surprise talking conditions using the RAVDESS dataset. Table  4  shows the average speaker identification performance based on each of GMM-CNN, SVM and MLP in neutral and emotional/stressful talking environments utilizing the RAVDESS database with and without CASA.\n\nThe proposed GMM-CNN model outperforms other models with and without CASA.

All models are evaluated using four distinct datasets including SUSAS public English dataset, ESD private Arabic dataset, RAVDESS public English dataset and the Fluent Speech Command public English dataset.\n\nThe proposed system also yields higher performance in noisy speech signals. The algorithm based on \"GMM tag based-feature vector reduction\" helps to minimize the complications of the CNN classifier, thus, improving system performance with reduced computational complexity. The proposed classifier outperforms other classifiers even in the presence of interference. The performance of all models has been improved when CASA system is being used.\n\nCASA based pre-processing module makes the system more efficient in noisy talking conditions. The CASA preprocessing module segregates the dominant signal from other interference signals before performing the speaker recognition task. This leads the system to perform more efficiently even in noise susceptible real applications.\n\nThe proposed system demonstrates improvement in angry talking condition. This is achieved by the combined effects of CASA and GMM-CNN classifier systems. CASA separates the dominant signal features from the distorted input signal, which enables the classifier to perform more efficiently in such a talking condition.\n\nThe CASA based pre-processing module plays an important role in system performance. The proposed algorithm uses a STFT-based frequency mask for speech separation from the noise signal. However, there is a dilemma in Time and Frequency analysis. Larger window size offers higher accuracy in the frequency domain. Smaller window size offers better accuracy in the time domain. Accuracy in both time and frequency domains is necessary to achieve better system performance.\n\nFurther study is necessary to improve system performance. The pitch estimation method needs to be enhanced since pitch is the main cue for speech segregation and can incorporate additional preprocessing speech de-reverberation techniques to enhance the scalability in reverberant conditions.",
