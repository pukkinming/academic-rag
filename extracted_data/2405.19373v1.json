      "text": "Emotion recognition based on Electroencephalography (EEG) has gained significant attention and diversified development in fields such as neural signal processing and affective computing. However, the unique brain anatomy of individuals leads to non-negligible natural differences in EEG signals across subjects, posing challenges for cross-subject emotion recognition. While recent studies have attempted to address these issues, they still face limitations in practical effectiveness and model framework unity. Current methods often struggle to capture the complex spatialtemporal dynamics of EEG signals and fail to effectively integrate multimodal information, resulting in suboptimal performance and limited generalizability across subjects. To overcome these limitations, we develop a Pre-trained model based Multimodal Mood Reader for crosssubject emotion recognition that utilizes masked brain signal modeling and interlinked spatial-temporal attention mechanism. The model learns universal latent representations of EEG signals through pre-training on large scale dataset, and employs Interlinked spatial-temporal attention mechanism to process Differential Entropy(DE) features extracted from EEG data. Subsequently, a multi-level fusion layer is proposed to integrate the discriminative features, maximizing the advantages of features across different dimensions and modalities. Extensive experiments on public datasets demonstrate Mood Reader's superior performance in cross-subject emotion recognition tasks, outperforming state-of-the-art methods. Additionally, the model is dissected from attention perspective, providing qualitative analysis of emotion-related brain areas, offering valuable insights for affective research in neural signal processing.",

      "text": "The envisioned maturation of BCI technology is expected to significantly expand human sensory, cognitive, and operational capabilities, offering unprecedented depth and breadth in human-machine interaction. However, truly efficient human-machine interaction relies not solely on the machine's ability to interpret and execute human commands, but more critically, on the sensitive detection and accurate recognition of users' implicit emotional states. Consequently, the task of emotion recognition has naturally emerged as a key research area.\n\nAlthough emotion recognition methods based on various physiological signals each have their unique characteristics, they predominantly face challenges related to the complexity of signal collection, difficulties in data processing, and high costs. Therefore, non-invasive EEG, with its relatively low cost, convenient signal collection, superior signal representation capability, and non-harmful nature to subjects, has rapidly become a primary research focus in the field of emotion recognition. The array of electrodes placed on the scalp effectively collects signals reflecting brain electrical activity. Through precise analysis and processing of these signals, an individual's emotional state can be effectively revealed.\n\nNon-invasive EEG signals are not without flaws. The unique natural physiological and anatomical structures of each individual introduce various degrees and aspects of noise interference into the measured EEG, imparting nonstationary characteristics to it. Additionally, issues such as the non-Euclidean distribution of multi-channel EEG electrodes based on biological topography collectively impact the accuracy of cross-subject emotion recognition tasks. Researchers have attempted to tackle these challenges from different directions. Transfer learning, as an indirect approach, has been utilized to migrate emotion recognition models, originally trained and adapted for existing subjects, to new individuals, aiming to minimize the EEG differences between the source and target domains  [1, 2] . Although this approach has indeed achieved certain recognition effects, it does not fundamentally solve the problem of cross-subject emotion recognition. Considering the graph-like topological structure of EEG channels and the rapid development of Graph Neural Networks (GNN), a surge of cross-subject emotion recognition methods based on GNN has emerged  [3, 4] , attempting to capture the local and global relationships among EEG channels. Similarly, other methods have also achieved certain yet limited improvements in recognition accuracy  [5, 6] .\n\nMotivated by the recent emergence of pre-trained models and their outstanding performance in downstream tasks  [7, 8, 9, 10, 11] , we recognized that the high-dimensional semantic information of EEG extracted by encoders trained on large-scale subject-independent datasets may contain global generic representations beneficial for emotion recognition tasks. Simultaneously, considering the DE feature, which has been proven to be the most effective individual computational characteristic for EEG-based emotion recognition tasks  [12, 13, 14] , as well as eye movement features often used as an additional modality to aid emotion recognition tasks and confirmed to improve recognition accuracy  [15] , we propose Mood Reader, a novel multi-modal and cross-scale fusion model for cross-subject emotion recognition that integrates global generic representations of EEG and the spatio-temporal interaction information in specific DE features. Specifically, our contributions are as follows:\n\n1. We propose an emotion recognition model architecture that integrates multimodal and cross-scale information, demonstrating exceptional performance in cross-subject recognition tasks. This architecture also proves that encoders pre-trained on large-scale EEG data possess the ability to learn emotionrelated features to a certain extent. 2. We have designed an attention-based interlinked spatio-temporal module for learning the compensatory relationships between spatio-temporal information, which aids in the fusion of spatio-temporal features.    [18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23] . The ablation studies of these researches powerfully validate the correctness of the direction of multimodal data fusion in the field of emotion recognition.",

Meanwhile, Bai et al. successfully overcame the inherent variability and noise of EEG data by deeply mining the semantics of EEG signals over time, migrated this technology to EEG, and applied it to downstream tasks such as decoding high-resolution images from brain activity  [25] .",

[26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33] . Therefore, for research fields including brain decoding and neural information processing, it is crucial to simultaneously capture the temporal and spatial information in brain signal data, for instance, fMRI and EEG. Since the attention mechanism was proposed, various application fields of deep learning, including but not limited to the field of emotion recognition based on EEG signals, have made great progress, and many excellent spatiotemporal information extraction modules have been deduced  [34, 35, 36] . In the realm of EEG-based emotion recognition, the Spatial-Temporal Attention (STA) mechanism emerges as a notable innovation for enhancing the interpretability and performance of deep learning models. This type of architecture ingeniously integrates spatial and temporal dimensions of EEG signals through parallel attention pathways, enabling the model to concurrently learn spatial correlations across EEG channels and temporal dependencies within signal sequences. Li et al. employed the spatio-temporal combination network R2G-STNN, which contains local-global feature combing, to extract the intrinsic information of EEG signals  [37] . In order to mine the spatiotemporal information related to emotional judgment, Gong et al. designed a stacked parallel spatial and temporal attention streams to respectively extract the spatial features and temporal features of the specially processed EEG signals  [38] . Although previous researchers have obtained satisfactory results, most of them have ignored the interaction and mutual compensation between spatial information and temporal information in EEG signals. In these network streamlines, the two kinds of information are often ignored. Parallel offload processing, which is contrary to the processing flow of neural signals in complex neural activities, may not be enough to handle more complex neural signal processing tasks.",

Specifically, we completed this task by training an autoencoder-decoder with an asymmetric architecture similar to that in  [25] on the EEG Motor Movement/Imagery Dataset  [39] . In this model, the temporal signals of EEG data were divided into tokens of a specific size, where a larger ratio of tokens would be randomly masked, and the architecture-simple decoder had to reconstruct the EEG data using the remaining unmasked tokens arrangement, combined with semantically rich embeddings outputted by the encoder after processing the original EEG data.The performance of masked reconstruction improves and reaches a peak when the mask ratio hits 75%  [25, 7, 24] . Consequently, by removing the decoder from this trained model, we obtained an encoder with excellent capability in extracting general EEG representations.",

      "text": "Previous sections presented outputs from various modules, each designed for emotion recognition through different pathways, yielding high-dimensional features. To address potential redundancy and the needs of multimodal cross-scale fusion, we introduce a multi-level fusion layer based on attention mechanisms. This module synergizes and refines features by highlighting relevant information and filtering out redundancy, thus improving multimodal emotion recognition efficacy.\n\nPrior to the commencement of the fusion process, the MBSM latent representation, spatial-temporal representation, and eye movement representation, are projected onto a unified dimensional space through a series of transformations, starting with layer normalization, followed by flattening of the feature vectors, and culminating in a linear transformation. As a result of these operations, a unified feature representation F ∈ R D unified is obtained, where D unified denotes the dimensionality of the unified feature space.\n\nIn the first level of fusion, specifically for the interlinked spatial-temporal features F S T and F T S , preprocessing is executed utilizing a linear layer and layer normalization, which preserves their dimensional attributes. Subsequently, inspired by  [18, 40, 41] , a simplified cross-attention mechanism is employed to delineate the intrinsic spatial-temporal relationships between the two, thereby augmenting the interactivity of the internal information. Specifically, the attention scores Score s and Score t , which represent the spatial features taking into account temporal features and time features taking into account spatial features respectively, are transformed using the softmax function to ascertain the corresponding fusion weights c s and c t ,\n\nwhere W S ,W T ∈ R D unified ÖD unified is a learnable weight matrix, the process of obtaining c t is analogous to this. The spatial-temporal fusion features F ST are then calculated by,\n\nThe processing of the MBSM latent representation and eye movement representation, corresponding to F EEG and F EY E respectively, is conducted in a manner akin to the aforementioned methodology. This approach yields an additional fused feature F EE , computed as a weighted sum:\n\nwhere c eeg and c eye represent the fusion weights derived from the respective attention scores. In the terminal fusion layer, an integration is requisite for the synthesized features F ST and F EE , which respectively represent the interlinked spatio-temporal information emanating from the DE feature and the comprehensive information spanning multiple modalities and scales.The features that have undergone layer normalization are concatenated and subsequently processed through self-attention computation, yielding the final integrated feature representation M ,\n\nFor the feature M , an initial batch normalization is employed, followed by the deployment of a classifier comprised of three linear layers and a softmax function, which outputs predictions for the emotional labels y. The discrepancy between the predicted emotional labels and the true emotional labels ŷ is quantified using the cross-entropy loss function,\n\nwherein N represents the batch size, and C designates the count of label categories.",

Subsequently, the sampling frequency was reduced to 200Hz from its original rate.

It can be observed that as the emotional recognition capability improves, the network's attention on EEG signals gradually shifts from a scattered global distribution to concentrated attention on specific regions. These brain regions include the frontal lobe area, areas of the left and right temporal lobes, and a small portion of the parietal lobe, which has been proven to be closely related to the generation and processing of emotions  [45] . Additionally, we noticed that there are also small areas within the occipital lobe, primarily responsible for visual information processing, that exhibit significant attention. Given that a substantial part of the stimuli in the experimental datasets SEED and SEED-V comes from visual stimuli in videos, we have reasonable grounds to propose the hypothesis that \"visually encoded information in the human brain is directly involved in emotion generation\" to a certain extent. This hypothesis also represents the holistic view that various parts of the brain participate in different functions and collectively process complex information  [46] .",
