      "text": "In this paper, we extensively present our solutions for the MuSe-Stress sub-challenge and the MuSe-Physio sub-challenge of Multimodal Sentiment Challenge (MuSe) 2021. The goal of MuSe-Stress sub-challenge is to predict the level of emotional arousal and valence in a time-continuous manner from audio-visual recordings and the goal of MuSe-Physio sub-challenge is to predict the level of psycho-physiological arousal from a) human annotations fused with b) galvanic skin response (also known as Electrodermal Activity (EDA)) signals from the stressed people. The Ulm-TSST dataset which is a novel subset of the audio-visual textual Ulm-Trier Social Stress dataset that features German speakers in a Trier Social Stress Test (TSST) induced stress situation is used in both subchallenges. For the MuSe-Stress sub-challenge, we highlight our solutions in three aspects: 1) the audio-visual features and the biosignal features are used for emotional state recognition. 2) the Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) with the self-attention mechanism is utilized to capture complex temporal dependencies within the feature sequences. 3) the late fusion strategy is adopted to further boost the model's recognition performance by exploiting complementary information scattered across multimodal sequences. Our proposed model achieves CCC of 0.6159 and 0.4609 for valence and arousal respectively on the test set, which both rank in the top 3. For the MuSe-Physio sub-challenge, we first extract the audiovisual features and the bio-signal features from multiple modalities.

      "text": "The emotional states play a crucial role in human work and daily life through affecting psychological and physiological status. It is noted that many people in modern societies are under a high level of stress  [1] . What's worse, the long-term accumulation of negative emotions may result in depression, which has an extremely severe impact on mental health. Thus, accurately recognizing human emotions is a fundamental but profound research direction. Emotion recognition systems have various applications, such as driver fatigue monitoring  [5] , health care especially mental health monitoring  [12] , building a secure and safe society  [30]  and human-robot interaction.\n\nAlthough the discrete categorical theory of emotion is a popular computing model for facial expression recognition  [18] , the continuous dimensional theory of emotion is the most commonly used for emotion prediction in time-continuous sequences. According to  [9] , many researchers have focused on dimensional models, such as the valence-arousal model  [32] . For example, Russel et al.  [24]  proposed a computing model of emotions characterized by two essential dimensions (i.e., valence and arousal). Marsella et al.  [19]  developed a model that treated a specific emotional state as a data point in the continuous space, which was described mathematically by 3 dimensions corresponding to arousal (a measure of affective activation), valence (a measure of pleasure), and dominance (a measure of control). Therefore, the continuous dimensional theory of emotion is suitable to compute the sentiments scattered across multi-modal sequences, because it can describe more subtle, continuous and complicated emotional states.\n\nAs we know, it is significantly subjective to annotate the emotions of human beings. However, multiple professional annotators must continuously annotate multi-modal sequences, which is time-consuming and laborious. Therefore, how to produce an agreed-upon representation (gold standard) from multiple labelers still remains an open research question, with few methods available. For example, given the level of disagreement, Michael et al.  [11]  proposed to use the Evaluator Weighted Estimator to weight different annotators based on the likelihood of agreement. It is limited for the research on the fusion of perceived emotional signals with extra physiological signals and there also has been minimal research on the combination between physiological and perceived arousal gold standard. Therefore, in the 2021 edition of the Multimodal Sentiment in-the-wild (MuSe) challenge  [27]  , apart from predicting the level of emotional arousal and valence in a timecontinuous manner from people in stressed dispositions for the MuSe-Stress sub-challenge, the signal of arousal is fused with the Electrodermal Activity (EDA) and then used as a prediction target for the MuSe-Physio sub-challenge. Participants are provided with the multimodal Ulm-TSST data-base, where subjects were recorded under a highly stress-induced free speech task.\n\nIn the MuSe-Stress sub-challenge, eGeMAPS is the best audio feature for the prediction of valence and arousal, achieving 0.5018 CCC and 0.4416 CCC on the test set respectively which reported in the baseline paper. VGGface is the best vision feature for the prediction of valence and arousal, achieving 0.4529 CCC and 0.1579 CCC on the test set respectively which reported in the baseline paper. Therefore, we choose eGeMAPS and VGGface feature sets for the MuSe-Stress sub-challenge in this paper. Apart from the audio features (eGeMAPs), the visual features (VGGface), the biosignal features (Electrocardiogram (ECG), Respiration (RESP), and heart rate (BPM)) are also selected. We apply the Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) with the self-attention module for modeling the complex temporal dependencies in the sequence from the audiovisual modalities and the LSTM network is used to capture the complex and continuous dependencies within the sequences from bio-signal modality. Finally, we concatenate all multi-modal features and subsequently send them into the regression model.\n\nIn the MuSe-Physio sub-challenge, the late fusion of the best audio (VGGish) and video (VGGface) predictions yield the best results, namely 0.4913 CCC on development data and 0.4908 CCC on test data according to the baseline paper. Therefore, we choose VGGish and VGGface feature sets for the MuSe-Physio sub-challenge in this paper. In addition, the bio-signal features (ECG, RESP, and BPM) are also the input of the model. Then, we utilize the LSTM with the self-attention mechanism module and the Gated Convolutional Neural Networks (GCNN) as well as the LSTM network for modeling the complex temporal dependencies in the sequence from the audio-visual modality respectively. The bio-signal features are concatenated and sent to the LSTM network. Finally, we concatenate all types of multi-modal features before sending them into the regression model.\n\nOur main contributions to the MuSe 2021 challenge in this paper can be summarized as follows:\n\n• We investigate the impact of various features including audio features, visual features and bio-signal features in both sub-challenges. We also demonstrate the effectiveness of the bio-signal features, which has not been well-used in corresponding sub-challenges of previous MuSe. The rest of this paper is structured as follows: Section 2 introduces the related work. The multimodal features are presented in Section 3. The methods are described in Section 4. The experimental setting and the results are presented in Section 5. Finally, we make the conclusive remarks and indicates the possible future directions in Section.",

      "text": "Multi-modal Features: Various multimodal features have been well investigated in the past series of AVECs, which are the predecessor of MuSe. Before the deep learning era, competitors tended to use carefully-handcrafted features for regression. For example, Sánchez-Lozano et al.  [25]  proposed to extract the Gabor feature and the Local Binary Patterns (LBP) for the individual visual modality and extract low-level features for the single audio modality. With the deep learning technique showing superior performance over carefully-handcrafted features, participants have been more likely to learn deep representations for both modalities by different variants of very deep networks. The methods  [4]    [15]  in AVEC 2017 demonstrated that utilizing the convolutional neural networks for the visual representations obtained comparable and even better results than carefully-engineered features. Furthermore, the results of  [33]  in AVEC 2018 demonstrated that the learned audio representations from the pretrained VGGish model could outperform expert-knowledge based acoustic features. Chen et al.  [2]  proposed to use 2D+1D convolutional neural networks in the very recent AVEC 2019, which also proved the superior performance of learned audio-visual features. Apart from audio-visual modalities, the linguistic features play an important part in multimodal emotion analysis  [23] . In AVEC 2017, the textual modality was first introduced to solve the recognition problem. At the very beginning, participants used the classic bag-of-words features  [15] . Subsequently, the word vectors (such as Word2Vec  [20]  and GloVe  [22] ) were widely applied because of their efficiency and effectiveness, which were pre-trained on large-scale text datasets.\n\nModel Architecture: Support vector regression (SVR) is the most commonly used as the baseline methods in previous AVECs. However, because of its non-temporal disadvantage, SVR cannot use the temporal and contextual information well to promote the performance of emotion recognition and sentiment analysis. With the increasing popularity of deep neural networks, the Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) has outperformed better in sequence modeling over other methods. Therefore, the 1st place winners of recent AVECs all adopted the LSTM network without exception, for continuous sentiment analysis. Previous methods  [31] ,  [4]  both utilized the LSTM and SVR to perform emotion regression. The experimental results demonstrated that the LSTM outperformed SVR dramatically. Compared with RNN based methods, a fully convolutional network was designed by Du et al.  [6] . It performed emotion recognition in a coarse-to-fine strategy by aggregating multi-level features with various scales. Huang et al.  [16]  utilized various types of temporal architectures to capture temporal contextual relationships within sequences. Their studies also revealed that the combination of various models resulted in better results.\n\nMulti-modal Fusion: It is indispensable for researchers to utilize multi-modal fusion to boost the performance of emotion prediction systems. Huang et al.  [15]  adopted the late fusion technique to aggregate the predictions based on different types of features in AVEC 2017, while the early fusion strategy was used by Chen et al.  [4]  to capture the inter-modal dynamics. In AVEC 2018, the detail comparison results of these methods were described by Huang et al.  [14] . The comparison demonstrated that methods with the late fusion predicted arousal and valence better than these with the early fusion. In AVEC 2019, Chen et al.  [3]  proposed to utilize both the early and the late fusion techniques in one model. They first trained the deep Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory networks (Bi-LSTM) for unimodal features. Afterwards, Bi-LSTMs were applied for fusing corresponding bi-modal features in an early stage. Finally, the predictions of various models were fused late by a second level Bi-LSTM. Moreover, Huang et al.  [17]  proposed to fuse multimodal information by the cross-modal attention module. Their results showed the proposed cross-modal attention could outperform better over both the early and the late fusion techniques.",

As a variant of VGG16, the VGGface architecture was initially intended for supervised facial recognition purposes  [26] , which was trained on 2.6 million faces. To get rid of irrelevant background information, we first apply MTCNN to detect and align faces in videos. VGGface  [21]  is then used to extract general facial features, which can present high-level and discriminative features compared with other facial recognition models.",

The freely and publicly available openSMILE toolkit  [8]  can be used to extract the eGeMAPS feature. Several statistical functions of the openSMILE toolkit can be directly applied to extract segment-level features with an 88-dimensional vector.\n\nVGGish Feature: VGGish  [13]  was pre-trained on AudioSet  [10] . Although VGGish was originally proposed for audio classification, previous studies, such as  [34] , demonstrated that the learned deep feature representation from trained VGGish outperformed carefullyhandcrafted acoustic features. Therefore, the pre-trained VGGish model is used to extract acoustic features in our work. We first divided the recordings into multiple 0.975 s frames with a hop size of 0.25s to match with the ground-truth labels. Afterwards, we extract the log spectrograms from these frames. Subsequently, they are sent into the VGGish model. The 128-dimensional embeddings from the output of fc2 layer are extracted as the final VGGish feature.",

Based on the model designed for the MuSe-Stress sub-challenge, the GCNN-LSTM-based model is added and used for modeling the temporal dependencies of acoustic feature and visual feature. It is noted that we use the VGGish feature instead of eGeMAPS feature in this sub-challenge. Figure  2  shows the architecture of our method, which contains four modules: the LSTM network with self-attention mechanism module for the acoustic and visual features, the gated CNN module with the LSTM network module for the acoustic and visual features, the LSTM module for the bio-signal features and the late fusion module. Firstly, we send the eGeMAPS feature and the VGGface feature to the LSTM network with self-attention module respectively and get the predictions from audio-visual modalities. Then, the same features are also sent to the gated CNN module with the LSTM network module respectively and get the predictions of audio and video modalities. Thirdly, the bio-signal features are concatenated and sent to the LSTM module in order to get the predictions of biosignal modality. Finally, all of the predictions from above modalities are concatenated and sent to the late fusion module. GCNN-LSTM-based Model: In this sub-challenge, we first train the model consisted of stacked gated convolution blocks with a LSTM layer and a fully connected layer.
