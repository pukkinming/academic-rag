      "text": "Emotion and personality are central elements in understanding human psychological states. Emotions reflect an individual's subjective experiences, while personality reveals relatively stable behavioral and cognitive patterns. Existing affective computing datasets often annotate emotion and personality traits separately, lacking fine-grained labeling of micro-emotions and emotion intensity in both single-label and multi-label classifications. Chinese emotion datasets are extremely scarce, and datasets capturing Chinese users' personality traits are even more limited. To address these gaps, this study collected data from the major social media platform Weibo, screening 11,338 valid users from over 50,000 individuals with diverse MBTI personality labels and acquiring 566,900 posts along with the users' MBTI personality tags. Using the EQN method, we compiled a multi-label Chinese affective computing dataset that integrates the same users' personality traits with six emotions and micro-emotions, each annotated with intensity levels. Validation results across multiple NLP classification models demonstrate the dataset's strong utility. This dataset is designed to advance machine recognition of complex human emotions and provide data support for research in psychology, education, marketing, finance, and politics. models has thus become an inevitable trend in text-based affective computing. The MuSe 2022 Challenge 17 introduced humor and emotional stress as dimensions, extending emotion models with additional states for customized emotional representation. ChineseEmoBank 18 provides fine-grained analysis of emotion intensity and is the first Chinese resource offering multi-level granularity in affective dimensions. In 2020, Google's team launched GoEmotions 19 , a dataset containing 28 emotion categories with 58,009 manually annotated text samples: single-label annotations account for 83%, double-label for 15%, triple-label for 2%, and 4-5 labels for 0.2%. GoEmotions pioneered a highly detailed multi-category, multi-label micro-emotion dataset; however, it offers limited multi-label annotations and lacks intensity differentiation among tags or personality traits. Emotion datasets primarily depend on manual annotation, which is costly and prone to subjective bias, particularly in the lack of micro-emotion labeling with intensity levels, limiting machine comprehension of subtle human emotions. Our previous research 20 introduced a micro-emotion annotation framework with continuous intensity scores, and this paper applies that framework to annotate micro-emotion data, establishing the Chinese Multi-label Affective Computing Dataset (CMACD) based on social media network users. Emotion detection primarily focuses on the emotions conveyed in text, often overlooking the stable internal factors of the text creator, namely personality. Personality, an essential concept in psychology, encompasses enduring response patterns toward others, events, and oneself, shaping an individual's unique adaptive abilities in social contexts. It reflects aspects of integrity, stability, uniqueness, and sociality within one's psychological makeup  21  . Numerous psychological studies emphasize personality as a critical psychological indicator and extend its application from personality research to affective computing. For instance, Kashaniet al.  22  assessed the impact of personality on emotional states in video game communication, Kamran et al.  23  applied personality traits to explain emotions in short texts, and Kitkowska 24 investigated how emotions and personal traits influence interactions with privacy policies. Personality-based affective computing has also garnered attention within large model research  25  . Since April 2022, the search index for the Myers-Briggs Type Indicator® (MBTI) on Baidu has surged, and in 2023, it topped the most popular terms on Weibo, reflecting sustained public interest in MBTI-related topics. Widely regarded as one of the most popular and reliable personality prediction methods 2 , MBTI has inspired significant attention. However, a publicly available dataset that integrates personality traits and emotions remains absent, and our CMACD dataset fills this gap. This dataset annotates each user's Weibo post with both personality traits (MBTI) and emotions, along with emotion intensity values. CMACD is a Chinese dataset focusing on personality and emotion. A user with a unique personality will express rich macro and micro emotions in their posts. As shown in Fig.  1 .",

      "text": "Text serves as a crucial medium for human emotional expression, and the primary task of text-based affective computing is to extract, analyze, understand, and generate subjective information from textual content. Over the past three years, text-based affective computing has seen rapid advancementsand applications across numerous fields, including psychology  1, 2, 3  , education  4, 5  , public welfare  6  , marketing  7  , finance  8, 9  , politics  10  , creative text generation  11  , robustness of large models  12  , and bias analysis  13  . Emotion detection has also become a focal point in chatbot research, as seen with the release of Microsoft's empathetic social chatbot in 2020  14  and Li's empathy-enabled chatbot with emotion causality  15  . Most emotion research relies on Ekman and Plutchik's emotion models  16  , where binary classification denotes the presence or absence of specific emotions, and ternary classification often uses categories such as positive, neutral, and negative. Although these models are straightforward and targeted, they struggle to capture the complexity of human emotions, frequently failing to identify the nuanced and varied emotions embedded in text (termed micro-emotions). A shift towards multi-category, fine-grained, and continuous annotation Chinese, one of the six official languages of the United Nations, is spoken by approximately 1.39 billion people worldwide, comprising nearly 20% of the global population  26  . China has 1.092 billion internet users, with over 600 million active users on Weibo  27, 28  . Numerous studies on text-based affective computing in Chinese social networks have emerged. For example, Wang Haoet al.  29  and Wang Youwei et al.  30  conducted research on misinformation detection, Kong et al.  31  and Tan et al.  32  explored psychological and medical issues, and Li Tiejun et al.  33  and Xiong et al.  34  developed recommendation systems based on sentiment analysis. Other studies have focused on topics such as the \"Double Reduction\" policy 35 , the \"Wandering Elephants\" event  36  , flood disasters  37  , traditional Chinese medicine  38  , and COVID-19  39，40  . Most emotion datasets used in these studies are small, privately collected Weibo datasets that are not publicly available. In a few cases, researchers have used English datasets limited to positive, negative, and neutral classifications. Publicly available Chinese emotion datasets are extremely scarce; the authors identified only one high-quality six-class single-label Chinese emotion dataset, primarily used for emotion detection competitions  41  . Given the nuanced nature of Chinese, along with its linguistic diversity, flexible grammar, and deep cultural roots, affective computing research involving Chinese cannot fully rely on English datasets. In summary, current Chinese emotion datasets face multiple limitations: the scarcity of publicly available datasets, the lack of quantified emotion intensity data, the predominance of single-label annotations, the absence of datasets with Chinese personality traits, and the rarity of publicly available Chinese multi-label emotion datasets.CMACD addresses these shortcomings by offering the first Chinese dataset that integrates personality traits with multi-level quantifications of emotion intensity. This dataset is of significant reference value for advancing machine understanding of human emotions and supporting research in psychology, education, public welfare, marketing, finance, and politics. The primary contributions of this paper are as follows: 1. CMACD is the first dataset to unify personality and emotion within a single dataset. 2. CMACD represents the first large-scale dataset of Chinese personality traits based on online user data. 3. CMACD, utilizing our published automatic emotion detection annotation tool, is the first to achieve machine-labeled macro-emotions and micro-emotions.",

The chart indicates that there are significant differences in the average post length among the different personality types, despite minimal variation in the minimum word count and the overall average. (3) Distribution of Users Across the Four Axes and Eight Polarities of MBTI According to the MBTI personality classification theory, personality traits are analyzed from four perspectives: cognitive functions, information processing, decision-making styles, and lifestyle orientations. These correspond to the four dimensions of IE, NS, TF, and JP (referred to as the \"four axes\" in this study). Each dimension is further divided into two opposing tendencies (for example, IE is divided into I and E), resulting in the \"four axes and eight polarities\" that combine to form the 16 personality types.

Experimental Design. Based on the aforementioned models, the experimental design considers the different input methods for MBTI display, large models like BERT, and other models. The specific approach is as follows:\n\n(1) In accordance with the MBTI classification rules, the experiment transforms the 16-class classification problem into four binary classification tasks, mapped as follows: {'I': 0, 'E': 1, 'N': 0, 'S': 1, 'F': 0, 'T': 1, 'J': 0, 'P': 1}.\n\n(2) The BERT model utilizes word embeddings as input, while other models or methods use the TF-IDF matrix as input. Experimental Results. Based on the algorithms, models, and experimental design outlined above, the personality type dataset is divided into training and test sets in a 7:3 ratio for training and validation. The final experimental results (Accuracy) are shown in Table  3  The results indicate that classical algorithms, neural networks, and large language models exhibit varying classification capabilities on our dataset, thereby validating the effectiveness and adaptability of the dataset for personality classification. Notably, BERT demonstrated exceptional classification performance, highlighting the unique advantages of large language models. The results of the MBTI text classification model based on BERT can serve as a benchmark for the classification performance of this dataset. MBTI Axis Correlation Test. According to MBTI theory, the 16 personality labels are composed of four different letters, each representing one axis of the four-dimensional framework. Each of these axes has two polarities, which can be represented in binary form (for example, the I/E axis, where I is 1 and E is 0). Consequently, each label can be expressed as a 4-dimensional vector based on the polarities of the axes. For instance, the personality type \"INFJ\" can be represented as the vector [1,1,0,1]. Using the vector values corresponding to the four axes of the MBTI labels in the dataset, we calculated the Pearson correlation coefficient to analyze the relationships between the four axes. The resulting correlation heatmap is shown in Fig.  15 . As shown in Fig.  15 , the correlations between the four axes are generally weak, indicating that the personality traits on each axis are relatively independent in our dataset. This suggests that the distribution of the four axes in our dataset is reasonable.",
