      "text": "Several high-profile events, such as the mass testing of emotion recognition systems on vulnerable sub-populations and using question answering systems to make moral judgments, have highlighted how technology will often lead to more adverse outcomes for those that are already marginalized. At issue here are not just individual systems and datasets, but also the AI tasks themselves. In this position paper, I make a case for thinking about ethical considerations not just at the level of individual models and datasets, but also at the level of AI tasks. I will present a new form of such an effort, Ethics Sheets for AI Tasks, dedicated to fleshing out the assumptions and ethical considerations hidden in how a task is commonly framed and in the choices we make regarding the data, method, and evaluation. I will also present a template for ethics sheets with 50 ethical considerations, using the task of emotion recognition as a running example. Ethics sheets are a mechanism to engage with and document ethical considerations before building datasets and systems. Similar to survey articles, a small number of ethics sheets can serve numerous researchers and developers.",

      "text": "If a team builds a new dataset, then it is recommended to create a datasheet or data statement  (Gebru et al., 2018; Bender and Friedman, 2018)  that lists key details of the dataset such as composition and intended uses. It is meant to encourage appropriate use of the data. If a team builds a new system, then it is recommended to create a model card  (Mitchell et al., 2019)  that lists key details of the model such as performance in various contexts and intended use scenarios. It is meant to encourage appropriate use of the system. For individual papers, we write ethics/impact statements; and conferences have started to institute ethics policies and ethics reviews. Limitations: Datasheets and model cards are pivotal inventions that will serve our community well. However, they are not without limitations and the specificity of their scope (on individual pieces of work) places additional constraints:\n\n• Authors are in a position of conflict of interest;\n\nthere are strong incentives to present their work in positive light (for paper acceptance, community buy-in, etc.) • There can be a tendency to produce boiler-plate text without a meaningful and critical engage-ment with the relevant ethical issues. • While there is important benefit in creating post-production documents that describe societal impact, it is arguably more important to engage with ethical considerations (and publish an ethics focused document) before building AI systems (and possibly even choosing to not build a system for a particular deployment context based on the analysis). • Lastly, ethics considerations apply at levels other than individual projects; e.g., at the level of AI tasks. A comprehensive engagement with the relevant ethical issues requires a wide literature review, and the resulting analysis to be presented in a dedicated document (and not in add-on sections for individual system papers).",

      "text": "I am defining AI task to simply mean some task we may want to automate using AI techniques.\n\nAn AI system is a particular AI model built for the task. Individual systems have their own unique sets of ethical considerations (depending on the choices that were made when building the systems). However, several ethical considerations apply not at the level of individual systems, but at the level of the task. For example, consider the task of detecting personality traits from one's utterances. Even before we consider a system for the task, we ought to consider questions such as:\n\n• What are the societal implications of automating personality trait detection? • How can such a system be used/misused? • Is there enough credible scientific basis for personality trait identification that we should attempt to do this?  • Automatic Emotion Recognition from Faces: China's emotion recognition market and its implications for human rights, Article19 4  .\n\n• Machine Translation: Female historians and male nurses do not exist, Google Translate tells its European users, Algorithm Watch. 5\n\n• Information Extraction: Google apologises for 'ugliest Indian language' search result, BBC. 6\n\nNumerous other such examples have surfaced in just the past few years for a variety of AI tasks.\n\nAdditionally, fields such as NLP and Computer Vision organize themselves in sub-fields by task (e.g., machine translation). Laws about AI ethics are also emerging in the context of AI tasks (Commission, 2020) -e.g., based on whether the task is high risk. Reading relevant literature, engaging with stakeholders, and past experience in developing systems helps one to start identifying relevant ethical considerations for an AI task; but that takes time. Meanwhile, tens of thousands of new researchers are joining our ranks. Pressures to graduate and find good jobs force them to build systems and publish papers in a matter of months. Even experienced researchers can find it difficult to keep track of various ethical considerations discussed in a wide assortment of conferences and journals.",

      "section_name": "Proposal: Ethics Sheets For Ai Tasks",
      "text": "If one wants to do work on an AI Task, then right at the beginning it is useful to have access to: a document that substantively engages with the ethical issues relevant to that task; going beyond individual systems and datasets, drawing on a body of relevant work.\n\nSimilarly, if one conceptualizes a new AI Task, then it is useful to simultaneously create such a source of information.\n\nTherefore, I propose that we researchers and developers write such articles, which I will refer to as Ethics Sheets for AI Tasks. In some ways, ethics sheets are similar to survey articles for areas of research, except here the focus is on ethical considerations for an AI task. Simply put: an ethics sheet for an AI task is a semi-standardized article that aggregates and organizes a wide variety of ethical considerations relevant for that task. It:\n\n• Fleshes out assumptions hidden in how the task is framed, and in the choices often made regarding the data, method, and evaluation. • Presents ethical considerations unique or especially relevant to the task. • Presents how common ethical considerations manifest in the task. • Presents relevant dimensions and choice points;\n\nalong with tradeoffs for various stakeholders. • Lists common harm mitigation strategies.\n\n• Communicates societal implications to researchers, developers, and the broader public.\n\nThe sheet should flesh out various ethical considerations that apply at the level of task. It should also flesh out ethical consideration of common theories, methodologies, resources, and practices used in building AI systems for the task. Ethics sheets may sometimes suggest that certain applications in specific contexts are appropriate or inappropriate, but largely they are meant to discuss the various considerations to be taken into account when the developer is deciding whether to build or use a particular system, how to build it, and how to assess its societal impact. It is meant to help the developer identify what is more appropriate for their given deployment context.\n\nA good ethics sheet will question some of the assumptions that often go unsaid. It will encourage more thoughtfulness:\n\n• Why should we automate this task?\n\n• What is the degree to which human behavior relevant to this task is inherently ambiguous and unpredictable?\n\n• What are the theoretical foundations?\n\n• What social and cultural forces motivate choices in task design, data, methodology, and evaluation? (Science is not immune to these forces-there is no 'view from nowhere'). • How is the automation of the task going to impact various groups of people? • How can the automated systems be abused?\n\n• Is this technology helping everyone or only those with power and advantage? etc.\n\nThinking about these questions is important if we want to break away from the current paradigm of building things that are divisive (that work well for some and poorly for others) and instead move towards building systems that treat human diversity and variability as a feature (not a bug);\n\nsystems that truly dismantle barriers to opportunity, and bring diverse groups of people together. Thus, questions such as those shown above can be useful in determining what is included in ethics sheets.\n\nTarget audience: The target audience of a sheet includes the various stakeholders of the AI Task.\n\nThe stakeholders may or may not have the time and background to understand the technical intricacies of an AI task. However, they build on, use, and make laws about what we create. Further, people are impacted by AI systems. They should be able to understand its decisions that impact them, understand its broad patterns of behaviour, contest the predictions, and find recourse. Ethics sheets can help to that end. It is our responsibility to describe our creations in accessible terms, so that others can make informed decisions about them.\n\nThus the target audience includes:\n\n• Researchers; developers • Educators (esp. those who teach AI, ethics) • Policy makers; politicians • People whose data is used; society at large Owing to differences in backgrounds and needs, it is better to create versions of the Ethics Sheet tailored to stakeholders, for example:\n\n• One sheet for society at large (with a focus on how system behaviour can impact them and how they can contribute/push-back); • One sheet for researchers, developers, and the motivated non-technical reader (with a greater emphasis on system building choices).\n\nEthics sheets complement datasheets and model cards: while the latter are post-production documents produced by system/data builders, ethics sheets are meant to be accessed before building systems. Similar to traditional survey articles, a small number of carefully created ethics sheets can serve numerous researchers and developers creating systems and data for AI tasks. See the FAQ in the Appendix (after references) for a discussion on some practicalities involved with who should create ethics sheets, when they should be created, for which tasks, etc. I discuss below some key characteristics and benefits of ethics sheets, followed by a template and a pointer to an example ethics sheet in the next section.",

      "text": "A single ethics sheet does not speak for the whole community (just as survey articles do not speak for the whole community). No one group can claim authority or provide the authoritative ethics sheet for a task. Ethics sheets can be created through large community efforts (through workshops or carefully maintained wikis) and smaller individual and group efforts. Efforts led by small teams may miss important perspectives. However, community efforts face several logistical and management challenges. They also have the tendency to only include agreed upon non-controversial ideas that do not threaten existing power structures. While each of these approaches to implement ethics sheets has their pros and cons, a multiplicity of ethics sheets is likely most promising. Multiple ethics sheets created (by different teams and approaches) reflect multiple perspectives, viewpoints, and what is considered important to different groups of people. We should be wary of a world where we have single authoritative ethics sheets per task and no dissenting voices.",

Aggregate and organize the ethical considerations associated with the AI task. Present the trade-offs associated with choices. Present harm mitigation strategies. Cite relevant literature. Organization of ethical considerations should be based on the primary target audience. For example, ethics sheets primarily for researchers and developers may benefit from sub-sections on: Task Design, Data, Method, and Evaluation. Task design may benefit from sections for theoretical foundations and 'why automate this task?'. Evaluation will benefit from sub-sections that go beyond quantitative metrics. Other: Include anything that helps with the goals of the Ethics Sheet.",

Ethical considerations often involve a cost-benefit analysis; where we draw the lines may differ depending on our cultural and societal norms. 4. Identifies points of agreement and disagreement. Includes multiple points of view. 5. Moves us towards consensus and standards. 6. Helps us navigate system development choices. 7. Helps develop better datasheets, model cards. 8. Has citations and pointers; acts as a jumping off point for further reading. 9. Helps stakeholders challenge assumptions made by researchers and developers. 10. Helps stakeholders develop harm mitigation strategies. 11. Standardized sections and a familiar look and feel make it easy for the compilation and communication of ethical considerations. 12. Helps engage the various stakeholders of an AI task with each other.\n\n13. Multiple ethics sheets created for the same task reflect multiple perspectives, viewpoints, and what is considered important to different groups of people at different times. 14. Acts as a great introductory document for an AI Task (complements survey articles and task-description papers for shared tasks).",

      "text": "I present below a template that can serve as a handy starting point in the creation of new ethics sheets, and that further clarifies what can be included in an ethics sheet. In the template below I will use Automatic Emotion Recognition (AER) as the running example. AER is a particularly interesting, widely applicable, and complex example of AI tasks with notable benefits and risks. Thus an ethics sheet for AER can be particularly instructive.\n\nIn her seminal book, Affective Computing, Dr. Rosalind Picard described Automatic Emotion Recognition (AER) as: \"giving emotional abilities to computers\". It is a sweeping interdisciplinary area of study exploring many foundational research questions and many applications  (Picard, 2000) . However, some of the recent commercial and governmental uses of AER have garnered considerable criticism, including: infringing on one's privacy, exploiting vulnerable sub-populations, and even allegations of downright pseudo-science (Wakefield, 2021; ARTICLE19, 2021; Woensel and Nevil, 2019). Even putting aside high-profile controversies, emotion recognition impacts people and thus entails ethical considerations (big and small). Mohammad (2022) presents an ethics sheet for automatic emotion recognition and sentiment analysis. It is a critical reflection of this broad field of study with the aim of facilitating more responsible emotion research and appropriate use of the technology. I will use some details from that sheet below to clarify the elements of the generic template.",

There are ethical considerations associated with each step of this development process. Below is a template of 50 considerations grouped by the associated stage: Task Design, Data, Method, Impact, Privacy & Social Groups (this final category is particularly important and cuts across Task Design, Data, Method, and Impact). I present only a high-level summary for each category below. See Mohammad (2022) for an instantiation of this generic template for the task of automatic emotion recognition (AER). It includes details on how these considerations manifest in AER. One can use the template below as a guide (in part or full), skip the considerations that do not apply, and describe how the relevant considerations manifest for their chosen task. One should notably include details of key considerations for their task whether it is included in this template or not.

Right to Non-Discrimination: Discuss whether automating the task can be used to discriminate against certain groups of people. Discuss safe guards.\n\nJ. Implications for Social Groups 47. Disaggregation: When building automatic prediction systems: Report performance disaggregated for each of the relevant and key demographic groups. (See work on model cards  Mitchell et al. (2019) .) Cite work reporting disaggregated results for the task.) 48. Intersectionality: People with multiple group identities are often not seen as prototypical members of any of their groups and thus are subject to, what is refered to as, intersectional invisibilityomissions of their experiences in historical narra-tives and cultural representation, lack of support from advocacy groups, and mismatch with existing anti-discrimination frameworks. Discuss implications of the task on those with multiple group identities. 49. Reification and Essentialization: Avoid reinforcing false beliefs that there are innate differences across different groups or that some features are central for one to belong to a social category. Appropriately contextualize work on disaggregation; for example, by impressing on the reader that even though constructs such as race are artificial and social in nature, the impact of people's perceptions and behavior around race lead to very real-world consequences. 50. Attributing People to Social Groups: In order to be able to obtain disaggregated results, sometimes one needs access to demographic information. This leads to considerations such as: whether the participants are providing meaningful consent to the collection of such data and whether the data is being collected in a manner that respects their privacy, their autonomy (e.g., can they choose to delete their information later), and dignity (e.g., allowing self-descriptions).",

      "section_name": "Concluding Thoughts",
      "text": "In this position paper, I discussed how ethical considerations apply not just at the level of individual models and datasets, but also at the level of AI Tasks. I presented a new form of documenting ethical considerations, which I call Ethics Sheets for AI Tasks. It is a document dedicated to fleshing out the assumptions and ethical considerations hidden in how a task is commonly framed and in the choices we make regarding the data, method, and evaluation. I listed various benefits of such ethics sheets and discussed caveats such as how a single ethics sheet does not speak for the whole community. I also provided a template sheet and an example, proof-of-concept, ethics sheet for automatic emotion recognition. Ethics sheets have the potential for engaging various stakeholders of AI tasks towards responsible research and development. I hope that this work spurs the wider community to ask and document:\n\nWhat ethical considerations apply to my task? Note: See FAQ in the Appendix for practical considerations involved in who should create ethics sheets, when, for what tasks, etc. A. To me, the answer is clear. We need to create ethics sheets for every task that has significant impact on people or deals with people or their artefacts in any significant way. This follows from the idea that we need to think about ethics considerations pro-actively and not as a reaction to harms that we observe after system deployment. Different AI tasks may be more or less prone to controversy, but all AI tasks impact people in some way, and thus have ethical considerations. Sometimes even small and seemingly innocuous choices can have far-reaching implications. Sometimes a thoughtful consideration can help make a small, but notable difference, to improve someone's life.\n\nEthics sheets for AI Tasks can provide the means for us as a collective to provide, in writing, what we think are the ethical considerations and the societal implications of AI Tasks. For some tasks, this document can be short and straightforward indicating minimum risk; and that document and the process that led to it are still useful. We do not know if there is minimum risk without some amount of investigation. Also, A written document allows others to challenge our assumptions and conclusions. This is a good thing! We cannot predict everything and anticipate every harm. We should not let that stop us from creating a working document that will be useful to others. Ethics sheets will always be incomplete and require revisions. Periodically revising the document builds on our knowledge.",

      "section_name": "Q2. Who Should Create Ethics Sheets?",
      "text": "A. There are two things going on here:\n\n1. Who should take a lead in developing ethics sheets (who takes on more of the burden)?\n\n2. Whose voices should be included?\n\nFor 1, anyone or any group can take the lead. Researchers already working on the task (or proposing a new task) are well-positioned to take the lead as they are familiar with the intricacies of the task and likely thinking about the ethical implications already. However, experienced researchers may have more blind spots. New researchers, especially those from Social Science, Psychology, Linguistics, etc. can bring vital new insights. For 2, the goal is to include voices of all stakeholders (especially of those impacted by the technology). However, the process can be iterative, starting at a smaller scale.\n\nQ3. When should we create Ethics Sheets for AI Tasks? Normally, we learn about ethical issues because/after they have been deployed.\n\nA. While we cannot foresee all consequences of our creations, it would be fair to say AI researchers have not done enough to anticipate the negative consequences of systems that we have created and deployed. Additionally, with great work over the last few years highlighting the ethical implications of AI systems, we are better placed to anticipate issues for the future. Therefore:\n\nFor existing tasks: create ethics sheets now; revisit and update periodically.\n\nFor new tasks: create ethics sheets along with the paper introducing the task; as the task has more buy-in from the community, others can also create a new ethics sheet or update the existing one.\n\nQ4. Does it matter what we define as a 'task'? AI tasks can be defined at a high/general level (e.g., automatic emotion recognition) or fine/specific level (e.g., detecting sentiment in book reviews).\n\nA. We can let community interest and expertise guide what task definitions are used (similar to topics of survey papers). It is great to have multiple overlapping ethics sheets that cover AI tasks at overlapping levels of specificity. There is no \"objective\" or \"correct\" ethics sheet or survey article.\n\nThere is no one \"correct\" scope or task definition for ethics sheets. It is useful to have multiple ethics sheets for the same or overlapping tasks, just as it is useful to have multiple survey articles for overlapping areas of research.\n\nQ5. Should the sheets depend on the kind of data or modality involved?\n\nA. Yes, one can create focused ethics sheets as appropriate. In the example AER sheet, I specify in the \"Scope and Modalities\" section that the sheet focuses primarily on AER from language (text).\n\nQ6. Should we think about research systems differently from deployed systems?\n\nA. In my view, deployed systems have a much higher bar in terms of balancing the many ethical considerations. It is common for research systems to focus on a smaller number of dimensions (say accuracy on certain test sets) ignoring certain other dimensions. However, research systems are often picked up by developers and deployed. So research systems should make their dimensions of focus clear to the reader/user. They should also discuss the suitability of deploying such a system, intended uses, and ethical issues that may arise if one deploys their system.\n\nQ7. Why should academic researchers care about the ethics of system deployment?\n\nA. Academic research feeds commercial research and development. We need to communicate the ethical considerations of what we create. Also, we are often not in positions of conflict of interest; no danger of losing our job for raising concerns.\n\nQ8. Should ethics sheets be updated?\n\nA. Yes, as technologies change and as society embraces new values, we need to create revisions or new sheets. Ethics sheets will act as an explicit record of what was considered important by different groups of people at different times.\n\nQ9. Won't ethics sheets slow things down?\n\nA. Ethics sheets aid in a win-win scenario: Assuming that one wants to create AI systems responsibly, having access to one or more ethics sheets for their task will help a researcher/developer obtain their goal faster. Also, we do not want to be going fast at the expense of others. Developing systems responsibly is in the best interest of all concerned. In that sense, slowing down is good.
