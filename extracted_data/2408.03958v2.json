      "text": "This research delves into the utilization of smartwatch sensor data and heart rate monitoring to discern individual emotions based on body movement and heart rate. Emotions play a pivotal role in human life, influencing mental well-being, quality of life, and even physical and physiological responses. The data were sourced from prior research by Juan C. Quiroz, PhD. The study enlisted 50 participants who donned smartwatches and heart rate monitors while completing a 250-meter walk. Emotions were induced through both audio-visual and audio stimuli, with participants' emotional states evaluated using the PANAS questionnaire. The study scrutinized three scenarios: viewing a movie before walking, listening to music before walking, and listening to music while walking. Personal baselines were established using DummyClassifier with the 'most_frequent' strategy from the sklearn library, and various models, including Logistic Regression and Random Forest, were employed to gauge the impacts of these activities. Notably, a novel approach was undertaken by incorporating hyperparameter tuning to the Random Forest model using RandomizedSearchCV. The outcomes showcased substantial enhancements with hyperparameter tuning in the Random Forest model, yielding mean accuracies of 86.63% for happy vs. sad and 76.33% for happy vs. neutral vs. sad.",

      "text": "Emotion, an integral part of human experience, influences various aspects of daily life, from mental wellbeing and social interactions to overall quality of life  [1] ,  [2] . The complexity of modern life necessitates innovative methods for comprehensive assessment and management of emotions  [3] . Wearable technology, such as smartwatches and fitness trackers, offers new avenues for emotion research, enabling real-time monitoring and analysis of emotional experiences in naturalistic settings  [4] ,  [5] . The convergence of psychology and technology holds the potential to advance our understanding of emotional phenomena and create effective programs to enhance mental health and well-being  [6] .\n\nPrevious studies have explored the use of wearable technology for emotion detection based on physiological responses and body movements  [7] ,  [8] ,  [9] ,  [10] . A notable study by Juan C. Quiroz, PhD, investigated the potential of smartwatch sensors to recognize emotional states by monitoring physiological signals such as heart rate and movement data  [10] . Quiroz's research demonstrated that it is feasible to detect emotions using data collected from wearable devices  [10] . The research employed a mixed design methodology and leveraged machine learning techniques to classify emotional states, consistently achieving median accuracies exceeding 78% across all conditions for the binary classification of happiness versus sadness  [10] . However, the study could benefit from further exploration to potentially enhance the accuracy and robustness of the emotion recognition models  [11] .\n\nBuilding on the foundational work of Quiroz, our study introduces a novel approach to emotion detection that leverages data from multiple sensors embedded in smartwatches and heart rate monitors. The study involves 50 participants who wore these devices while walking 250 meters. Emotional states were induced using audiovisual and audio stimuli, and the participants' emotional conditions were evaluated using the Positive and Negative Affect Schedule (PANAS) questionnaire  [12] . Unlike Quiroz's study, which used a static set of parameters for machine learning models, our research implements the Random Forest algorithm with hyperparameter tuning using RandomizedSearchCV  [13] . The Random Forest algorithm is an ensemble learning method that constructs multiple decision trees and merges their results to improve predictive performance and control overfitting  [14] . By tuning the hyperparameters of the Random Forest model using RandomizedSearchCV, we systematically sample different combinations of hyperparameters and evaluate their performance using cross-validation, aiming to find the optimal configuration that maximizes the model's predictive accuracy and generalizability  [15] .\n\nHyperparameter tuning is crucial as it involves selecting the best combination of parameters such as the number of trees in the forest, the maximum depth of each tree, and the minimum number of samples required to split a node in a Random Forest model  [16] . This process enhances the model's ability to generalize from the training data to unseen data, thereby improving its accuracy and reliability in emotion detection tasks  [17] .\n\nOur study builds on the existing body of research by specifically addressing the limitations of Quiroz's work regarding model optimization. By incorporating hyperparameter tuning with the Random Forest algorithm, we introduce a significant advancement that offers a promising solution to enhance the accuracy and robustness in Submitted: dd/mm/yyyy; Accepted: dd/mm/yyyy; Published: dd/mm/yyyy emotion recognition  [18] . This enhancement is expected to yield better predictive performance and reliability, thereby advancing the field of emotion detection using wearable technology  [19] .\n\nBy combining physiological signals and movement data, this study aims to uncover unique patterns associated with different emotional states  [20] . This comprehensive approach not only enhances the detection capabilities but also contributes to a deeper understanding of the interplay between physiological responses and emotions. Furthermore, the use of advanced machine learning techniques ensures that our findings are both reliable and applicable to a wide range of real-world scenarios  [21] .\n\nOur research strives to advance the field of emotion detection by introducing a robust and accurate method that leverages the strengths of wearable technology and sophisticated machine learning algorithms. The use of Random Forest with hyperparameter tuning holds significant promise for improving the detection and analysis of emotions, ultimately contributing to better mental health monitoring and personalized user experiences  [22] . This study represents a step forward in the quest for non-invasive, real-time emotion detection systems that can be seamlessly integrated into daily life, providing valuable insights for both researchers and practitioners in the field of affective computing.",

      "text": "The data collection process involved enlisting 50 young adult volunteers from a university campus in North-West UK. Predominantly female, comprising 43 individuals, the participants had an average age of 23.18 years. As payment for taking part in the study, each volunteer earned 7 euros. It's important to note that all participants reported no visual or hearing impairments and were capable of walking unaided. Recruitment was carried out through notices on bulletin boards and word of mouth, ensuring a representation of healthy and active campus individuals.\n\nThis mixed-design study aimed to explore emotions, including happy, sad, and neutral states, induced through audio-visual stimuli, consisting of movie clips, and audio stimuli, including music clips. Throughout the experiment, participants wore smartwatches on their left wrists and heart-rate straps fastened around their chests. The heart-rate straps, utilizing the Polar H7 sensor, facilitated the collection of PANAS (Positive Affect and Negative Affect) scores. The experiment was conducted three times to adequately cover each emotional state. The data were obtained from the Juancq/emotion-recognition-smartwatch repository on GitHub. The smartwatches, specifically Samsung Gear 2, were equipped with tri-axial accelerometers and tri-axial gyroscopes, capturing participants' movements. These sensors were worn by participants throughout the experiment duration. The experimental conditions included: (1) participants watching movie clips before walking, (2) participants listening to music clips before walking, and (3) participants listening to music while walking. Heart rate monitoring was facilitated by the Polar M400 watch worn by the experimenter, who monitored the data in real-time. After collecting the data we will get the CSV files and then we continue to preprocessing data. Figure  2  illustrates the flowchart of the data collection process, detailing each step from data collection to data preprocessing. Table  1  shows an overview of the user study encoding, which encompasses participant ID, condition, age, sex, and the start and end times for each condition. The participant ID serves as a unique identifier for each individual involved in the study, facilitating data tracking and analysis. The condition refers to the specific experimental setup or treatment administered to participants, guiding the tasks or stimuli they encountered. Age provides demographic insight by indicating the age of each participant during the study, while sex denotes their gender. These demographic factors contribute to understanding potential variations in responses. Additionally, the start and end times for each condition denote the duration of experimental phases, aiding in temporal synchronization and analysis. Table  2  shows an overview of the raw data collected in CSV format, including various sensor readings such as acceleration (ax, ay, az), gravity-compensated acceleration (ax_g, ay_g, az_g), rotation (rot_x, rot_y, rot_z), and heart rate. These data, captured from wearable devices like smartwatches and heart rate monitors, offer valuable insights into participants' physiological responses and movements throughout the study, facilitating analysis of the relationship between physiological signals and emotional states or behaviors.",

Next is Model Training with Training Data, where the model is trained using the training data to learn the underlying patterns or relationships in the data. Following that, Cluster Label Prediction occurs, where once trained, the model is used to predict cluster labels or outcomes for new or unseen data. There is an exception for Random Forest with Hyperparameter Tuning Implementation, which includes an additional step: Hyperparameter Tuning Phase. In this step, the hyperparameters of the random forest model are tuned to optimize its performance. This phase occurs before the cluster label prediction step.

      "text": "The DummyClassifier from sklearn serves as a rudimentary classification model used as a baseline for comparison with more sophisticated classifiers. It operates by making predictions independent of input features (X), essentially ignoring the feature values during prediction. The primary purpose of the DummyClassifier is to provide a reference point for evaluating the performance of more complex models. In this study, the \"most_frequent\" strategy is employed, wherein the predict method always returns the class label that is most frequently observed in the training data (y) during the fit method invocation. Similarly, the predict_proba method returns the empirical class distribution of y, representing the prior class distribution. Essentially, this model consistently predicts the class label with the highest frequency in the training data and its probability distribution Zikri Kholifah Nur, Copyright © 2024, MIB, Page 5 Submitted: dd/mm/yyyy; Accepted: dd/mm/yyyy; Published: dd/mm/yyyy follows the empirical prior class distribution. This strategy offers a simplistic yet useful comparison baseline and serves as a straightforward \"dumb\" model. Comparing the performance of more sophisticated models against this basic baseline allows researchers to gauge the effectiveness and added value of complexity in their models. If the performance of the DummyClassifier is comparable to the best-performing model, it suggests the need for further investigation into the data or model architecture. Figure  6",

      "text": "Logistic regression is a statistical method employed to predict the probability of a binary outcome based on one or more predictor variables. It models the relationship between the predictors and the log-odds of the event, utilizing a sigmoid function to transform the linear prediction into a probability between 0 and 1  [23] . The model's parameters are estimated using maximum likelihood estimation, enabling the interpretation of coefficients in terms of the impact of predictors on the outcome's likelihood. While inherently designed for binary classification, logistic regression can be extended to handle multi-class problems through techniques like one-vs-rest or multinomial logistic regression, broadening its applicability across diverse classification tasks. Figure  7  illustrates the fundamental concept of Logistic Regression. It showcases the characteristic S-shaped curve, also known as the sigmoid function, which represents the model's output -the predicted probability of the binary outcome (Y) given the input variable (X). The curve demonstrates how the predicted probabilities lie between 0 and 1, smoothly transitioning from low to high probabilities as the value of X increases. The red dots superimposed on the graph might represent the actual observed data points, highlighting how the logistic regression model fits the data and estimates the probability of belonging to a particular class. The position of these points in relation to the curve visually indicates the model's accuracy in classifying the data.",

      "text": "In machine learning, the Random Forest algorithm is a potent ensemble learning method that's frequently used to solve issues with both regression and classification. It belongs to the family of tree-based models and is known for its robustness and versatility across various domains. A collection of decision trees, each trained on a random subset of the training data and features, is the fundamental building block of Random Forest. This approach of randomization during training lessens the likelihood of overfitting and enhances the model's ability to generalize by decorrelationing the individual trees  [24] .\n\nZikri Kholifah Nur, Copyright © 2024, MIB, Page 6 Submitted: dd/mm/yyyy; Accepted: dd/mm/yyyy; Published: dd/mm/yyyy Individually, each decision tree in a Random Forest is constructed by recursively partitioning the feature space into regions or leaves based on feature values. The splitting criteria aim to minimize impurity or maximize information gain at each node. However, unlike traditional decision trees, Random Forest introduces additional randomness by randomly sampling both the data and features at each split.\n\nA forest of trees is created during the training phase as a consequence of the independent growth of several decision trees. Each tree in the forest independently forecasts the target variable for regression tasks or the input data for classification tasks in order to generate predictions. In classification, the final prediction is typically determined by a majority vote among the trees, while in regression, it is often the average of the predictions from all trees. Mathematically, the prediction process of a Random Forest can be described as follows:\n\nFor classification:\n\n𝑦 ̂= 𝑚𝑜𝑑𝑒(𝑦1, 𝑦2, . . . , 𝑦 𝑛 )  (2)  where 𝑦 ̂ represents the predicted class label, and 𝑦1, 𝑦2, . . . , 𝑦 𝑛 are the class labels predicted by each decision tree in the forest.\n\nRandom Forest offers several advantages over other machine learning algorithms. It is robust to overfitting, thanks to the ensemble nature of the model and the inherent randomness in tree construction. Moreover, it is resistant to noise in the data and capable of handling high-dimensional feature spaces efficiently. Due to its high performance and ease of use, Random Forest finds applications in various domains, including healthcare, bioinformatics, and natural language processing. Figure  8  illustrates the step-by-step process of Random Forest Classification, from dataset division to final prediction through majority voting of multiple decision trees. Random Forest with Hyperparameter Tuning using Random Search is an advanced technique aimed at optimizing the performance of a Random Forest model by fine-tuning its hyperparameters. Hyperparameters are configuration settings that control the behavior of the model during the training process, things like the total number of trees in the forest, each tree's maximum depth, and the least amount of samples needed to divide a node  [25] .\n\nThe Random Search method involves systematically sampling hyperparameter combinations from a predefined search space and evaluating the performance of each combination using cross-validation. Unlike grid search, which exhaustively evaluates all possible combinations, random search randomly selects a subset of hyperparameter combinations to evaluate, making it more computationally efficient, especially for large search spaces. During the hyperparameter tuning process, the Random Forest model is trained multiple times using different combinations of hyperparameters. Each trained model is then evaluated on a validation set using a performance metric such as accuracy, precision, recall, or F1 score. The hyperparameter combination that yields the best performance metric on the validation set is selected as the optimal configuration for the Random Forest model. The advantage of using Random Search for hyperparameter tuning is that it allows for a more thorough exploration of the hyperparameter space compared to manual tuning or simple heuristics. By randomly sampling hyperparameter combinations, Random Search can efficiently discover promising regions of the search space, even in high-dimensional or non-convex spaces.\n\nRandom Forest with Hyperparameter Tuning using Random Search is a powerful technique for optimizing the performance of Random Forest models, leading to improved accuracy and generalization on unseen Zikri Kholifah Nur, Copyright © 2024, MIB, Page 7 Submitted: dd/mm/yyyy; Accepted: dd/mm/yyyy; Published: dd/mm/yyyy data.
