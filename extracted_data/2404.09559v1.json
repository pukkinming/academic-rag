      "text": "The integration of human emotions into multimedia applications shows great potential for enriching user experiences and enhancing engagement across various digital platforms. Unlike traditional methods such as questionnaires, facial expressions, and voice analysis, brain signals offer a more direct and objective understanding of emotional states. However, in the field of electroencephalography (EEG)-based emotion recognition, previous studies have primarily concentrated on training and testing EEG models within a single dataset, overlooking the variability across different datasets. This oversight leads to significant performance degradation when applying EEG models to cross-corpus scenarios. In this study, we propose a novel Joint Contrastive learning framework with Feature Alignment (JCFA) to address cross-corpus EEG-based emotion recognition. The JCFA model operates in two main stages. In the pre-training stage, a joint domain contrastive learning strategy is introduced to characterize generalizable time-frequency representations of EEG signals, without the use of labeled data. It extracts robust time-based and frequency-based embeddings for each EEG sample, and then aligns them within a shared latent time-frequency space. In the fine-tuning stage, JCFA is refined in conjunction with downstream tasks, where the structural connections among brain electrodes are considered. The model capability could be further enhanced for the application in emotion detection and interpretation. Extensive experimental results on two well-recognized emotional datasets show that the proposed JCFA model achieves state-of-theart (SOTA) performance, outperforming the second-best method by an average accuracy increase of 4.09% in cross-corpus EEG-based emotion recognition tasks.",

      "text": "Objective assessment of an individual's emotional states is of great importance in the field of human-computer interaction, disease diagnosis and rehabilitation  [3, 5, 9, 46] . Existing research mainly uses two types of data for emotion recognition: behavioral signals and physiological signals. Behavioral signals, including speech  [13] , gestures  [25] , and facial expressions  [39] , are low-cost and easily accessible but can be intentionally altered. On the other hand, physiological signals, such as electrocardiography (ECG), electromyography (EMG), and electroencephalography (EEG), offer a more reliable measure of emotions as they are less susceptible to manipulation. EEG, in particular, stands out for its ability to provide direct, objective insights into emotional states by capturing brain activity from different locations on the scalp. Therefore, researchers from diverse fields have increasingly focused on EEG-based emotion recognition in recent years  [12, 18, 19, 23] .\n\nCurrently, a variety of methods have been developed for EEGbased emotion recognition. For example, Song et al.  [33]  proposed a dynamical graph convolutional neural network (DGCNN) to dynamically learn the intrinsic relationship among brain electrodes. To capture both local and global relations among different EEG channels, Zhong et al.  [43]  proposed a regularized graph neural network (RGNN). Concerning domain adaptation techniques, Li et al.  [17]  introduced a joint distribution network (JDA) that adapts the joint distributions by simultaneously adapting marginal distributions and conditional distributions. Incorporating self-supervised learning, Shen et al.  [29]  proposed a contrastive learning method for inter-subject alignment (CLISA), and achieved state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance in cross-subject EEG-based emotion recognition tasks. More related literature review is available in Section 2. However, two critical challenges remain unaddressed in current methods. (1) Experimental protocol. Existing approaches mainly consider within-subject and cross-subject experimental protocols within one single dataset, neglecting to account for variations between different datasets. This oversight can significantly reduce the effectiveness of established methods when applied to cross-corpus scenarios  [28] . (2) Data availability. Zhou et al.  [45]  introduced an EEG-based emotion style transfer network (E 2 STN) to integrate content information from the source domain with style information from the target domain, achieving promising performance in cross-corpus scenarios. However, it requires access to all labeled source data and unlabeled target data beforehand. Considering the difficulties in collecting EEG signals and the expert knowledge and time required to label them, obtaining labeled data in advance for model training is impractical in real-world applications.\n\nTo tackle the aforementioned two critical challenges, this paper proposes a novel Joint Contrastive learning framework with Feature Alignment (JCFA) for cross-corpus EEG-based emotion recognition. The proposed JCFA model is a self-supervised learning approach that includes two main stages. In the pre-training stage, a joint contrastive learning strategy is introduced to identify aligned time-and frequency-based embeddings of EEG signals that remain consistent across diverse environmental conditions present in different datasets. In the fine-tuning stage, a further enhancement on model capability to the downstream tasks is developed by incorporating spatial features of brain electrodes using a graph convolutional network. In summary, the main contributions of our work are outlined as follows:\n\n• We propose a novel JCFA framework designed to tackle two main critical challenges (experimental protocol and data availability) encountered in the field of cross-corpus EEGbased emotion recognition.",

      "text": "Existing methods for EEG-based emotion recognition can be categorised into two groups. (1) Machine learning-based methods use manually extracted EEG features, such as Power Spectral Density (PSD)  [11]  and Differential Entropy (DE)  [7] , for emotion recognition. For example, Alsolamy et al.  [2]  employed PSD features as input to a support vector machine (SVM)  [34]  in emotion recognition. However, the performance of traditional machine learningbased methods tends to be relatively poor and unstable. Therefore, researchers have turned to developing various (2) deep learningbased models in recent years. For example, Song et al.  [31]  proposed a graph-embedded convolutional neural network (GECNN) to extract discriminative spatial features. Additionally, they introduced a variational instance-adaptive graph method (V-IAG)  [30] , which captures the individual dependencies among different electrodes and estimates the underlying uncertain information. To further reduce the impact of individual differences, transfer learning strategy is suggested to incorporate. For instance, Li et al.  [21]  proposed a bi-hemispheres domain adversarial neural network (BiDANN) to address domain shifts between different subjects. Considering the local and global feature distributions, Li et al.  [20]  proposed a transferable attention neural network (TANN) for learning discriminative information using attention mechanism. Further, Zhou et al.  [44]  introduced a novel transfer learning framework with prototypical representation based pairwise learning (PR-PL) to address individual differences and noisy labeling in EEG emotional data, achieving SOTA performance. However, the above methods would fail in adapting to cross-corpus scenarios, due to the substantial differences in feature representation among different datasets.",

Each sample 𝑥 tune 𝑖 is paired with a label 𝑦 𝑖 ∈ {1, . . . , 𝐶}, where 𝐶 is the number of emotion categories. The objective is to pretrain a model F , utilizing D pret through a self-supervised learning strategy. The pre-training process enables F to derive generalizable representations of EEG signals, without the need of labeled information. Then, we refined the pre-trained model F in the supervised fine-tuning stage, using a small amount of the labeled data from D tune . The fine-tuned model F can be regarded as adept at well performing cross-corpus EEG-based emotion recognition.\n\nThe central idea of the JCFA model is inspired by a fundamental assumption in signal processing theory  [8, 27] , which suggests the existence of a latent time-frequency space. In this space, the timebased embeddings and frequency-based embeddings learned from the same time series should be closer to each other compared to embeddings from different time series. To satisfy this assumption, a joint contrastive learning strategy across time, frequency, and time-frequency domains is proposed. Here, the extracted time-and frequency-based embeddings of the same sample are aligned within the time-frequency domain. The resulting time-and frequencybased embeddings are considered generalizable representations of EEG signals, which are robust across various datasets.",

First, we generate the frequency spectrum 𝑥 F 𝑖 from 𝑥 T 𝑖 by Fourier Transformation  [26] . Then, we perform data augmentation in frequency domain by perturbing the frequency spectrum. The existing research has shown that applying small perturbations to the frequency spectrum can easily lead to significant changes in the original time series  [8] . Thus, unlike the substantial perturbation by adding Gaussian noise directly to frequency spectrum in  [22] , we perturb the frequency spectrum 𝑥 F 𝑖 weakly by removing and adding a small portion of frequency components. Specifically, we generate a probability matrix 𝑈 drawn from a uniform distribution 𝑈 (0, 1), which matches the dimensionality of 𝑥 F 𝑖 . When removing frequency components, we zero out the amplitudes in 𝑥\n\nSimilar to L T,𝑖 , we calculate L F,𝑖 among all positive pairs, including (𝑥 F 𝑖 , 𝑥 F 𝑖 ) and ( 𝑥 F 𝑖 , 𝑥 F 𝑖 ).

Then, we assume that the time-based embedding and frequency-based embedding learned from the same sample should be closer to each other in the latent space than embeddings of different samples. Therefore, we define the time-based embedding and frequency-based embedding from the same sample as positive pair. The time-and frequency-based embeddings from different samples are considered as negative pairs. In other words, (𝑧 T 𝑖 , 𝑧 F 𝑖 ) is positive pair, while (𝑧 T 𝑖 , 𝑧 T 𝑗 ) and (𝑧 T 𝑖 , 𝑧 F 𝑗 ) are negative pairs.
