      "text": "Many studies have identified particular features of artificial intelligences (AI), such as their autonomy and emotion expression, that affect the extent to which they are treated as subjects of moral consideration. However, there has not yet been a comparison of the relative importance of features as is necessary to design and understand increasingly capable, multi-faceted AI systems. We conducted an online conjoint experiment in which 1,163 participants evaluated descriptions of AIs that varied on these features. All 11 features increased how morally wrong participants considered it to harm the AIs. The largest effects were from human-like physical bodies and prosociality (i.e., emotion expression, emotion recognition, cooperation, and moral judgment). For human-computer interaction designers, the importance of prosociality suggests that, because AIs are often seen as threatening, the highest levels of moral consideration may only be granted if the AI has positive intentions. \n CCS CONCEPTS • Human-centered computing → Empirical studies in collaborative and social computing; Empirical studies in HCI.",

      "text": "Can a machine matter morally? Could it ever be morally wrong to harm an artificial intelligence (AI)? Such questions have long been popular in science fiction and philosophy. They are of increasing interest to human-computer interaction (HCI) researchers with the rise of sophisticated AIs, such as social robots and chatbots, that evoke moral reactions from humans  [4, 25, 31, 46, 47, 53] . For example, people feel empathy towards robots being harmed  [29]  and intervene to protect them  [70] . A recent study on the companionship chatbot Replika found that users expressed moral sentiments, such as feeling guilt for causing the chatbot's \"death\" when deleting the app and for being unable to give their Replika enough emotional support  [43] . While most people do not yet explicitly consider AIs to be subjects of moral consideration  [53, 59] , many somewhat support protecting AIs from cruel treatment  [46]  and granting legal rights to sentient AIs  [47] . People also attribute future AIs morally relevant capacities, such as emotions  [53] .\n\nFor designers and practitioners to account for the prevalence and effects of moral consideration, there is a need for more comprehensive understanding of how people react to the many different features on which AIs vary, such as their autonomy  [13, 46] , emotion expression  [44, 49] , and physical appearance  [40, 57] . For example, will users extend more moral consideration to a chatbot if it is more cooperative or more autonomous? Should engineers prioritize training a machine learning model to recognize the emotions of users or to express emotion-like states? Answering such questions depends on complex, relative effects that cannot be deduced from the current literature and that are difficult to assess with conventional user testing.\n\nThe present study estimates the relative effects of 11 features of AIs on their moral consideration using a conjoint experiment  [6, 30] . Conjoint experiments, most commonly used in the field of marketing, are increasingly applied in a range of disciplines, including HCI  [5, 38] . The methodology is ideal because it allows for the estimation of the effects of a large number of independent variables, much larger than a traditional experiment, on a single dependent variable. In the present experiment we asked participants to complete a series of tasks in which they evaluated pairs of AIs that varied in their levels of each feature (e.g., \"Not at all,\" \"Somewhat\"). We found that the presence of each feature increased moral consideration for AIs, and the strongest effects were from AIs having human-like physical bodies and the capacity for behaving prosocially (i.e., emotion expression, emotion recognition, cooperation, and moral judgment).",

      "section_name": "Background",
      "text": "Below we summarize the existing empirical literature for each of the 11 features and develop hypotheses for their effects on the moral consideration of AI. Because of the breadth of this study across many different features, we only present a cursory review of each. We arrived at these features by reviewing the existing literature and conducting a pretesting study, detailed in the supplementary material, with an online sample that showed people 24 literature-based features and asked for quantitative scores of their importance for moral consideration as well as free-text addition of three features that were not in the provided list. We started with seven features popular in the literature and added four that were judged by pretesters as most important, using our own subjective judgement to mitigate overlap between features (e.g., leaving out \"having goals\" because it is often considered a component of \"intelligence\"). This kept the total number of features close to those in typical conjoint experiments  [6] . Additionally, moral consideration is often associated with mind perception, the attribution of internal mental faculties such as feeling pleasure or pain  [28] . We wanted to avoid asserting the presence of such capacities in AIs because some people think that AIs fundamentally cannot have them. We therefore defined the features in functional, behavioral terms (e.g., \"emotion expression\" rather than \"feeling emotions\"). This means that participants who think it is possible for AIs to have such mental faculties can infer them from their functions and behaviors, but participants who do not think such mental faculties are plausible can respond merely on the basis of functions and behaviors.",

      "section_name": "Autonomy",
      "text": "There are multiple definitions of autonomy in the HCI and humanrobot interaction (HRI) literature  [9] . While it is not a unidimensional concept, we operationalized it for the purpose of the present study as the capacity to behave independently, without the need for human control or supervision. Theoretically, autonomy should increase the extent to which AIs are perceived as human-like  [18, 34] , which should in turn positively affect the extent to which they are granted moral consideration  [75] . Some empirical research supports this: Lima et al.  [46]  found that describing AIs and robots as \"fully autonomous\" increased the extent to which people think they should be granted rights, and Chernyak and Gary  [13]  found that children granted more moral consideration to a robot that appeared to move autonomously than one controlled by a human. However, autonomy can also have negative effects: Złotowski et al.  [79]  found that people reported more negative attitudes (e.g., feeling \"uneasy\" or \"nervous\") towards social and emotional interactions with autonomous than with non-autonomous robots, as measured by the Negative Attitudes Towards Robots scale Nomura et al.  [50] , and that this effect was mediated by a combination of realistic threats (e.g., taking jobs) and identity threats (e.g., to \"human uniqueness\"). Overall, we predicted that AIs described as more autonomous would be granted more moral consideration (H1).",

HRI studies suggest that having a human-like physical body (compared to a robot-like or mechanical body) increases the moral consideration of AIs. For example, Nijssen et al.  [49]  found that people are less willing to sacrifice anthropomorphic robots than mechanical robots in moral dilemmas, Küster et al.  [40]  found that people considered it more morally wrong to harm a humanoid robot than a zoomorphic one, and Riek et al.  [57]  found that the extent to which people empathized and were willing to help robots depended on their degree of anthropomorphic appearance. There is less research on people's moral consideration of AIs with physical bodies versus those without physical bodies at all. Some studies have found people rate physical robots higher than virtual agents on some relevant measures, such as lifelikeness  [36, 56] , though Lima et al.  [46]  found no difference in respondents' attribution of rights between \"robots\" and \"AIs. \" Overall, we predicted that AIs described as having robotlike or human-like physical bodies would be granted more moral consideration than AIs described as having no physical bodies (H2).",

Shank  [64]  found that people were more likely to resist and punish computers that used coercive versus cooperative social strategies, and Shank  [65]  found that more helpful sales computers were evaluated more positively and as more moral. While there are many different forms of cooperation, which may have heterogenous effects in practice, we hypothesized that AIs that are described as more cooperative would be granted more moral consideration (H4).",

[19]  found that robots that displayed emotional responses in interactions with participants were rated higher on relevant measures such as human-likeness, likeability, and closeness, than robots that displayed neutral responses. However, perceived emotion can also have negative effects on perceptions of AI; Gray and Wegner  [27]  found that it causes the uncanny valley, the feeling of creepiness that some people report when interacting with human-like AIs. Overall, we considered that the existing research supports the hypothesis that AIs described as expressing emotions to a greater extent would be granted more moral consideration (H6).",

For example, people tend to think it would be very morally wrong to harm a child, but not very morally wrong to harm a rock. In this survey, we are interested in understanding how morally wrong you think it would be to harm various artificial beings.\" We defined \"artificial beings\" as \"intelligent entities built by humans, such as robots, virtual copies of human brains, or computer programs that solve problems, that may exist now or in the future.\" Participants were then told that they would be asked to complete a series of tasks, each of which would require them to read descriptions of two artificial beings presented side-by-side in a table, and then to choose which of the two beings they think it would be more morally wrong to harm. This question, adapted from Gray et al.  [26] , was the dependent variable through which we operationalized moral consideration.\n\nThese tasks made up the conjoint experiment, which was a choice-based, partial-profile, randomized design. The \"partial-profile\" aspect refers to the number of features presented in each task. In a \"full-profile\" design all features are presented in each task. In the present study, we randomly assigned seven of the 11 total features listed in Table  1  to each participant to include in each task. While Bansak et al.  [7]  showed that the number of features in a study can be much higher than 11, we considered that the more abstract, novel nature of our study favored a simpler partial-profile design. The seven features shown to each participant were held fixed throughout the experiment and presented in each task in the same order for each participant to ease cognitive load  [30] . For the same reason, key words of the features were highlighted in bold, as shown in Table  1 . The levels of each feature, listed in the third column of Table  1 , were randomly selected in each task by taking two levels from a randomized list that contained each level twice (e.g., \"Not at all, \" \"Not at all, \" \"Somewhat, \" \"Somewhat, \" \"To a great extent, \" \"To a great extent\"), which made combinations of two different levels slightly more likely and combinations of the same levels slightly less likely than if the feature levels were selected for each artificial being with equal probability. An example choice task is shown in Figure  1 . We used the same levels (i.e., \"Not at all\", \"Somewhat\", \"To a great extent\") for many of the features to maintain consistency and limit cognitive load, though they could have been interpreted in different ways for different features.\n\nWe asked participants whether they think it could ever be wrong to harm an artificial being that exists either now or in the future (1 = Definitely not, 7 = Definitely). This question was used in sensitivity analysis, reported in the supplementary material. Using the same scale, we also asked participants whether they think artificial beings could ever experience pain or pleasure and whether artificial beings could be as intelligent as a typical human. These latter two questions were collected for exploratory purposes and were not used in any further analysis; we report these results in the supplementary material.\n\nParticipants then answered demographic questions on their age, gender, ethnicity, education, income, and political views.

We therefore estimated the effects of the features with standard errors clustered at the participant level. The AMCEs are presented in Figure  2  and Table  2 . The second column of Table  2  is the estimated effect for each feature. For example, the estimate of 0.062 for \"Autonomy: Somewhat\" indicates that if an AI was described as being \"somewhat\" autonomous, participants were 6.2 percentage points more likely to choose that AI as being more morally wrong to harm than an AI described as \"not at all\" autonomous. As the table and figure show, each of our 11 hypotheses (H1-H11) were supported; each of the features significantly affected participants choices about which AI it would be more morally wrong to harm in the expected direction.

The present study adds to the literature by providing evidence of the importance of several features that have received less attention: complexity, cooperation, emotion recognition, and capacity for human language. We compared each pair of effects to each other to estimate their relative strength. We found three categories of effect size. In the first category, with the strongest effects, were an AI's capacity for moral judgment and emotion expression. In the second category were emotion recognition, cooperation, and having a human-like physical body. In the third category, with the weakest effects, were autonomy, complexity, damage avoidance, language, and having a social purpose. While intelligence also had a positive effect, with the effect of having intelligence \"To a great extent\" compared to \"Somewhat\" being of a similar magnitude to the equivalent comparison for the features in the second category (see Table  S8  in the supplementary material), we did not formally include it in this analysis because it was measured differently to the other features, as described above. In general, intelligence could be considered a meta-feature that undergirds many of the other features that we considered; it does not seem possible that a being with no intelligence at all could, for example, be autonomous, avoid damage, or recognize emotions in others.\n\nFour of the top five features-emotion expression, emotion recognition, cooperation, and moral judgment-reflect an AI's capacity to interact prosocially with humans. The extant literature has focused most on the capacity for experience as a driver of moral consideration  [28] . Why do we instead find prosociality matters most in the case of AIs? This may reflect that humans perceive AIs as threatening-to our resources, our identity, and even our survival  [79] . We therefore grant them moral consideration conditionally, to the extent that they show prosocial intentions towards us. Further understanding the effects of these prosocial features, especially why they have the strong effects that they do in the context of AI, is a key topic for future research.\n\nOther than prosociality, the strongest effect was having a humanlike physical body. This could be explained via an increased perception that the AIs have minds  [1, 21, 27] , though this explanation seems less likely because we included a range of features indicative of mind (e.g., emotion expression, damage avoidance) alongside an AI's body. A second possibility is that it reflects an anthropocentric bias based on mere appearance and human-likeness, perhaps echoing work in HRI  [33] , human-agent interaction  [12] , and social psychology  [42]  that shows humans also engage in group-based dynamics, such as in-group favoritism, with AIs. These possible explanations should be tested in future research.\n\nFrom a design perspective, we know that AIs with human-like physical bodies and prosociality can promote better quality HCI  [19, 77] . This can be due to factors such as creating greater familiarity with the AI and building on existing skills developed in social interactions between humans  [77] . The present study suggests that building AIs with human-like bodies and prosociality may have significant effects on moral consideration. Given the importance of morality in social interaction, designers may want to implement such features in AIs only when they aim to mimic human-human interaction. By increasing moral consideration, designing AIs with human-like bodies and prosociality could also help solve the problem of people being abusive towards AIs  [2, 51] , which can cause expensive damage and dangerous situations for bystanders, though further research should be conducted on this question because human-likeness in AIs has also been found to be associated with greater levels of abuse  [35] . Additionally, Schwitzgebel and Garza  [62]  argue that we should design AI systems that evoke reactions that reflect their true moral status (i.e., how much they matter morally, for their own sake). If we build AIs with capacities associated with moral status, such as consciousness  [41]  or sentience  [3] , we should consider also designing them with human-like bodies, prosociality, or other features that affect moral consideration to facilitate accurate perceptions of the AIs. On the other hand, they argue that if the AIs do not actually have moral status, then building them with consideration-provoking features could result in people wasting resources to benefit AIs that they erroneously think warrant moral consideration. Another consideration against evoking such reactions is that they can cause psychological distress and conflict in users who feel that they have obligations towards the AIs  [43] . Overall, AI designers should consider that building AIs with certain features will likely have effects on moral consideration with a variety of consequences for interaction, sometimes unintended.",

      "section_name": "Limitations",
      "text": "Our study has some limitations. First, while the Prolific sample had some demographic measures close to the U.S. population (e.g., 47.9% women), it was not nationally representative, and we did not collect data from outside the U.S.\n\nSecond, conjoint experiments test hypothetical preferences rather than real-world behaviors. While such information is important, and many societal decisions are made on the basis of such hypotheticals (e.g., voting for social policies), they do not always translate to practical behavior, such as in the privacy paradox, the finding that people consistently report preferences for privacy that are not borne out in their online behavior  [39] . Future research should test the relative effects of these features in more concrete scenarios, such as with large language models, interactive robots, virtual agents, and other multifunctional AI systems.\n\nThird, we asked participants how morally wrong they considered it to harm AIs. While this is a core aspect of moral consideration  [27] , moral consideration arguably has additional aspects, such as the attribution of rights. Also, while we gave participants background information about this idea, the use of a single measure is more likely to be misinterpreted than a more detailed measure would be. For example, participants could have interpreted our question in terms of the wrongness of actions they could take against the AIs (e.g., kicking a physical robot vs. deleting a non-physical AI) rather than about the AIs themselves. To explore this further, we conducted a study with 20 new participants asking why they thought it was morally wrong to harm the AIs they chose in this task and what they understood by the word \"harm. \" As detailed in the supplementary material, participants tended to give reasons relating to the AIs themselves rather than specific actions (e.g., almost 50% indicated choosing AIs that had features that made them seem more human). Participants also typically understood the word \"harm\" broadly, capturing any sort of damage to the AIs, physical or psychological (e.g., \"to injure, inflict pain, inflict physical or mental violence.\") Overall, it seems that participants interpreted the question as we intended. Still, future research should assess additional aspects of moral consideration, such as through Piazza et al. 's moral standing scale  [54] .\n\nFourth, we used the levels \"Not at all,\" \"Somewhat,\" and \"To a great extent\" to describe the way in which the AIs had most of the features. While these levels are intended to be neutrally worded, it may be that, for example, people perceive the word \"somewhat\" differently when paired with \"complex\" compared with \"intelligent. \" This is important to be aware of when making comparisons across features. An alternative approach would be to use feasture levels that are tailored to the specifics of each feature, though this could increase cognitive load, and, at least in the present study, it would introduce additional variation that makes direct comparisons more challenging. Future research should test such alternative designs.\n\nFinally, our study prioritizes breadth over depth. This means that our operationalizations have less nuance than they would in a study of only a small number of features. For example, we operationalized \"autonomy\" as varying along a single dimension, the degree of independence from human control, but autonomy is more complicated, such as in the type of human control exerted. Similarly, we operationalized \"body\" using only three levels, \"Human-like physical body, \" \"Robot-like physical body, \" and \"No physical body, \" but there are other possibilities, such as a zoomorphic body or an ability to be uploaded into different bodies. There are many openings for future studies to build on this breadth-focused study by exploring particular variations across and within these features, especially of the features with the largest measured effects reported here.",

Because AIs can have a wide range of relevant features, we conducted an experiment testing the effects of 11 features on the moral consideration of AI. The presence of each of the features increased moral consideration, with the strongest effects from having a human-like physical body and the capacity for prosociality. In a world where AIs are perceived as threatening to humans, such as by replacing us in the workplace and challenging our sense of uniqueness, the highest levels of moral consideration may only be granted if the AI shows positive intentions.",
