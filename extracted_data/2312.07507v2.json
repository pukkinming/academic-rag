      "text": "In the task of emotion recognition from videos, a key improvement has been to focus on emotions over time rather than a single frame. There are many architectures to address this task such as GRUs, LSTMs, Self-Attention, Transformers, and Temporal Convolutional Networks (TCNs). However, these methods suffer from high memory usage, large amounts of operations, or poor gradients. We propose a method known as Neighborhood Attention with Convolutions TCN (NAC-TCN) which incorporates the benefits of attention and Temporal Convolutional Networks while ensuring that causal relationships are understood which results in a reduction in computation and memory cost. We accomplish this by introducing a causal version of Dilated Neighborhood Attention while incorporating it with convolutions. Our model achieves comparable, better, or state-of-the-art performance over TCNs, TCAN, LSTMs, and GRUs while requiring fewer parameters on standard emotion recognition datasets. We publish our code online for easy reproducibility and use in other projects -Github Link.",

      "text": "The study of emotion recognition has gained significant importance due to its widespread applications in various disciplines, including Human-Computer Interaction. Socially assistive robots, medical diagnosis of disorders such as PTSD  [50] , and software usability testing  [23]  in particular rely heavily on accurate emotion recognition. For instance, a better understanding of human emotions enables socially assistive robots to comprehend and respond appropriately to various scenarios, leading to effective assistance  [2] . As a result, the development of advanced emotion recognition techniques holds immense potential in revolutionizing various aspects of our lives.\n\nA common issue with the task of emotion recognition and understanding is lack of data. This is commonly due to the fact that annotation is a non-trivial task. This means that architectures must be expressive enough without large data sizes. The classification of emotions from video inputs is a task that has been extensively studied in the field of computer vision. A common approach to this problem involves performing classification directly on individual frames using convolutional networks  [49] . However, this approach ignores the temporal aspect of emotion, which is critical to its accurate recognition. Humans exhibit emotions over a period of time, and considering this temporal aspect can lead to significant improvements in performance through contextual understanding  [46] .\n\nTo incorporate temporal information into emotion recognition from video inputs, various techniques have been proposed, including Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs)  [48]  and Transformers  [8, 16, 61] . While GRUs and LSTMs are effective in modeling temporal dependencies, they suffer from slow training times, unstable training, and high computational costs. This is because their gradients flow through time rather than in parallel  [22] . Transformers, on the other hand, typically suffer have a large parameter size and require more operations due to their self-attention mechanism attending to a large receptive field. Commonly the two models are combined for optimal performance  [58] .\n\nAn alternative solution that has gained popularity is the Temporal Convolutional Network (TCN)  [5, 44, 59] . The TCN allows for the modeling of temporal dependencies in video tasks and time-series tasks similar to RNNs and LSTMs, but with more stable gradients and higher efficiency at large receptive fields due to parallelized computation of gradients  [5, 34] . The receptive field of the TCN can be easily adjusted with the number of layers, kernel size, and dilation factor. The TCN is a promising method for video tasks due to its efficiency benefits while understanding temporal dependencies  [3]  for emotional understanding.\n\nTemporal Convolutional Networks do pose performance issues in regard to it's understanding complex relationships in the short and long term of a sequence and more irregular sequences  [40] . Models attempt to address this, but fall short in terms of model size and performance due to the large size of self attention or auxiliary models  [6, 40, 61] . TCAN attempts to intertwine attention layers  [17]  which leads to larger models.\n\nIn this paper we introduce a new Temporal Convolutional Network known as NAC-TCN which addresses concerns about complex temporal relationships while maintaining or improving the benefits of TCNs -stable gradients and computational efficiency.",

      "text": "1.1.1 Recurrent Networks. Long-Short Term Memory Units (LSTMs) are a response to the hard to train nature of RNNs  [45] . RNNs store a hidden state that can be used in order to represent all prior knowledge. Though this may be a strong representation, there are often training issues in long sequences. LSTMs include a forget gate that can allow for data to not be stored in the cells memory unit state. The LSTM has an input, output, and forget gate. LSTM models suffer from a large amount of operations per cell. Gated Recurrent Units  [9]  attempt to solve this by not holding a memory unit, instead only having update and forget gates. Despite the less complex structure, it has similar performance to LSTMs  [11] .\n\n1.1.2 Attention and Transformer. Self Attention  [9, 54]  was introduced for language tasks. Instead of simply holding a weight and bias, self attention focuses on parts of the input and weights sequential inputs based on a query, key, and value matrix. These attention models can be used in conjunction with recurrent models for better performance (Sec. 1.1.1).\n\nTransformers use layered attention with encoders and decoders  [12, 54] . This has been commonly used in NLP tasks, but recent advances have moved towards it's application in computer vision  [4] .\n\nThese 2 methods represent a divergence in machine learninguse of classical recurrent methods or a move to the more computationally heavy transformer. In this paper, we hope to show a third path that can incorporate the benefits of both while alleviating their pitfalls.",

      "text": "The Temporal Convolutional Network  [5, 44, 59 ] is a convolutional representation of temporal data. It contains 2 commonly used parts, the main casual convolution network (Sec. 2.1.2) and dilated convolution (Sec. 2.1.1) in order to create a Dilated Temporal Convolutional Network.\n\n2.1.1 Dilated Convolution. The dilation (à trous Convolution)  [59]  allows for a model to have a larger receptive field without increasing parameters. Dilated convolution is achieved by introducing \"holes\" between the points addressed by the kernel, resulting in a larger receptive field. The term \"gaps\" will be used to refer to any method of expanding a kernel through gaps to widen the receptive field.\n\n2.1.2 Dilated Temporal Convolutional Network. Introduced in WaveNet  [44] , a Dilated Temporal Convolutional Network is a temporal network model that computes timesteps in parallel rather than sequentially. This fundamentally alters how the model addresses backpropagation through time by performing backpropogation for all time steps at once rather than following a temporal gradient flow. A casual convolution is used in order to prevent leakage from the past into future steps. (1)\n\nA dilated convolution is used in order to allow a network to understand time steps from previous steps efficiently and exponentially increase the receptive field  [59] . Without dilated convolutions, TCNs would have a linear receptive field to prior steps. With dilations, the receptive field to previous timesteps (frames) can be calculated as\n\nwhere 𝑑 is the dilation factor, 𝑘 is the kernel size, and 𝑛 is the number of hidden layers. Commonly, a dilation factor of 2 is used in order to achieve an exponential receptive field  [5] . Dilated Temporal Convolutional Networks (TCNs) allow for a large amount of temporal data to be processed with low computation through a large receptive field. TCNs allow for parallel computation, a large receptive field, and helps avoid vanishing or exploding gradients due to its backpropagation not being parallel to the temporal sequence, but rather perpendicular. Dilated TCNs have achieved impressive results replicating the long-term memory understanding of other architectures like LSTMs and RNNs such as the copying memory task  [5] . The TCN has also been adopted for action segmentation achieving state-of-the-art results on action detection  [35] . TCNs have also been explored in emotion analysis, achieving results above those of LSTMs and RNNs on emotion based tasks  [61] . TCNs commonly consist of temporal blocks, which are made up of two convolutional layers that are stacked on top of each other. The purpose of stacking these layers is to ensure that the input data is first scaled to the expected size and then passed through a convolutional layer of the output size.",

      "text": "Neighborhood Attention (NA) is an attention method that utilizes a sliding window technique similar to a convolution which views the time series at incriments like a convolution instead of all at once such as self-attention. This is similar to methods such as the SWIN transformer  [20, 38]  but the main difference comes from how NA allows for overlapping sgements, a method showed to improve performance by ensuring translation equivariance over similar methods  [19, 20] . NA was introduced in order to address poor efficiency of self-attention and sliding window techniques by using a tiled algorithm and efficient CUDA kernels published in the N𝐴𝑇𝑇 𝐸𝑁 library [1].\n\nDilated Neighborhood Attention (DiNA). is a method introduced to further address the performance of attention  [19] . This dilated transformer works similar to dilated (also known as à trous) convolutions  [59] . This improves performance beyond Neighborhood attention by attending to a higher receptive field in less operations than a normal transformer. When 𝑑 is a dilation value and 𝑘 is a neighborhood (kernel) size, DiNA reduces time complexity of self-attention from 𝑂 (𝑛 2 𝑑) to 𝑂 (𝑛𝑑𝑘).  [17]  is a TCN-based model that intertwines attention to maintain receptive field while providing an attention mechanism. This model has seen improvements over the TCN on language datasets. Although the method has seen improvements over the TCN, it leads to a significant parameter increase and it doesn't preserve the casual nature of the TCN, meaning that information flows freely between layers, and loses the temporal property due to leakage.",

A combination of convolution and attention layers has been shown to produce improved results  [57] . Our method makes use of Dilated Neighborhood Attention  [19, 20, 56] , and shifting inputs to maintain causality. 1x1 convolutions  [37]  are added on the input of each temporal block in order to ensure that residual connections have the same tensor shape in a similar fashion to the original TCN.

Adding convolutions achieves this twofold: being able to reduce dimensionality through downsampling (a feature that doesn't exist in NAT) and using a convolution over an attention block with fewer parameters. Additionally, our motivation for stacking convolutions and Di-NAT comes from the benefits of convolutions that have been understated by recent works. Prior work has noted that though attention based methods outperform, they mainly do on a very large scale  [14] . Primarily, lack of convolutions loses the benefit of quick and easy translational equivariance and requiring larger datasets/training time to perform as expected or a use of regularization  [53] . This becomes important in domains such as emotion recognition, as datasets are tedious to collect as they require expert annotators and a mix of annotators requires agreement in labeling, which can be sometimes subjective 1  .",

𝑉 , 𝑄, and 𝐾 are all calculated in the same manner as self-attention, as 𝐷𝑖𝑁 𝐴(𝑖) tends to simply self-attention as you increase 𝑘 and decrease 𝑑 to 1. In order to stop temporal leakage, we must ensure that for an input (𝑥 𝑡 |𝑥 0 , ..., 𝑥 𝑡 -1 ) to each temporal block, the output (𝑦 𝑡 |𝑦 0 , ..., 𝑦 𝑡 -1 ) must be influenced by a time step at least 1 less than 𝑡. To ensure this, we change 𝜌 𝛿 𝑗 (𝑖) to represent the nearest neighbor to the left of the 𝑖-th value with a dilation 𝛿. This would mean that for a neighborhood 𝑘, the farthest value referenced is 𝛿 • (𝑘 -1) to the left of the input sequence (not including the 𝑥 𝑡 itself), rather than\n\n. In order to ensure this, we pad DiNA 𝛿 𝑘 (𝑖) and the convolutions using casual padding in order to make sure that timesteps are not influenced by the future, then removing padding before the next temporal block to ensure length consistency.

DiNA is not used for this 1x1 convolution because of its inability perform dimension scaling. NAC-TCN reduces parameters compared to the multi-model approach proposed by others  [18, 62, 64] , the original TCN, and TCAN  [17] .

We find that the causal relation is important in both datasets, but is more dramatic in the EmoReact dataset. This suggests that emotions are better learned when future information is unknown. This phenomenon of better learning with less information can be attributed to two potential reasons. Firstly, emotions inherently involve a causal process, wherein per-frame annotations occur continuously, thereby influencing annotators' decisions based on prior frames rather than knowledge of future frames. This can lead to different understandings depending on what context is used. Secondly, the disparity between the datasets stems from the variation in label format. AffWild2 employs per-frame labels, allowing for non-causal predictions of adjacent frames, whereas EmoReact utilizes end-of-video labels, thereby elevating the significance of causality (the last frame culminating in information from previous frames rather than ℎ/2 prior frames). We find that prior literature commonly uses causal relationships over acausal with better results, making it an interesting point of discussion for future work.",
