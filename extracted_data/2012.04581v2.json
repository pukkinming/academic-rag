      "text": "Micro-expression has emerged as a promising modality in affective computing due to its high objectivity in emotion detection. Despite the higher recognition accuracy provided by the deep learning models, there are still significant scope for improvements in micro-expression recognition techniques. The presence of microexpressions in small-local regions of the face, as well as the limited size of available databases, continue to limit the accuracy in recognizing micro-expressions. In this work, we propose a facial microexpression recognition model using 3D residual attention network named MERANet to tackle such challenges. The proposed model takes advantage of spatial-temporal attention and channel attention together, to learn deeper fine-grained subtle features for classification of emotions. Further, the proposed model encompasses both spatial and temporal information simultaneously using the 3D kernels and residual connections. Moreover, the channel features and spatio-temporal features are re-calibrated using the channel and spatio-temporal attentions, respectively in each residual module. Our attention mechanism enables the model to learn to focus on different facial areas of interest. The experiments are conducted on benchmark facial micro-expression datasets. A superior performance is observed as compared to the state-of-the-art for facial micro-expression recognition on benchmark data. \n CCS CONCEPTS • Computing methodologies → Activity recognition and understanding.",

      "text": "In recent years, facial expression recognition using deep learning techniques have gained lot of popularity among the research community because of its potential applications across various fields, such as psychology, marketing, security, etc. However, recognizing true human emotions from facial expressions often becomes unreliable due to the performer's deliberate control on the expressions, depending on the social circumstances. Hence, micro-expression recognition has evolved as an attempt to capture the true emotion of a performer  [3] . Micro-expressions are involuntarily exposed short term expressions that appear during an active suppression of facial expression to hide the true emotion. Micro-expressions are very short spanned (fraction of a second; usually around 0.5 seconds), which makes the task of capturing the relevant features for recognizing emotion as challenging  [4] .\n\nEfforts have been made to apply Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) for micro-expression recognition  [25, 34] . Although CNN models are able to automatically capture useful features from the videos, but they are often unable to capture the minute textural changes on various parts of the face, observed during microexpressions. To capture the minute textural information, facial landmarks are used for feature extraction  [11] . However, even the temporal features play an important role in recognising facial microexpressions.\n\nA few efforts have also been made in capturing temporal cues from optical flow, for recognizing micro-expressions  [5, 17, 18] . However, features based on optical flow are frequently hampered by unnecessary motion information from background pixels. Another line of thought for capturing temporal features suggests applying a Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) on the spatial features  [12] [13] [14] . A few 3D CNN based models can also be found in the literature, to capture temporal cues  [19, 30] . The existing approaches of applying temporal features often fails to capture the minute texture information from micro-expression videos, where the expression continues for the very short span of time. Attention based models often show efficacy in extracting the minute texture information  [15, 24] . However, attention mechanism is still not properly explored for micro-expression recognition task.  Wang et al.  proposed a spatial attention model for micro-expression recognition  [36] .  Wang et al.  proposed an attention mechanism for recognizing micro-expression using just the apex frame from the micro-expression video. The model completely ignores the temporal information between the frames. Whereas, the proposed model considers both spatial and temporal information simultaneously by applying 3D Conv operations while recalibrating features using attention mechanism and residual connections to learn more fine grained information. To capture the temporal information from the short span of video, where the micro-expression takes place, we propose a 3D channel and spatio-temporal attentions based model called as MERANet. Due to the utilization of the 3D Spatial attention and Channel attention, the proposed model is able to ignore the background information while focusing on the region of interest precisely which is consistent across the frames of the video and responsible for the given micro expression. Fig.  1  represents the overall idea of the proposed MERANet model. The main contributions of this paper are as follows:\n\n• A 3D residual attention is introduced in this paper for recognizing subtle features related to micro-expressions by attention guided re-calibration of features. • In order to prioritize the important channels and spatiotemporal features, the channel attention and spatio-temporal attention blocks are used as part of the residual module. • The increase in number of parameters and FLOPs in the proposed model is negligible as compared to the vanilla model.\n\n• Extensive experiments are performed to show the impact of the proposed 3D residual attention model on micro-expression recognition. We show the saliency map to visualize the effect of the proposed approach in extracting features from faces during expression.\n\nNext we provide a survey of literature for facial micro-expression recognition.",

      "text": "Handcrafted Feature based Methods. The traditional approaches for micro-expression recognition were mostly focused on superficial attributes involving complex calculations. Polikovsky  [28]  proposed a three step algorithm that divides the facial region into twelve parts to obtain facial cubes. They computed 3D orientation histogram descriptor to capture correlations across the frames for each facial cube. They classified the expression based on the normalized descriptor vectors. Shreve et al.  [32]  utilized the facial strain caused by the non-rigid motion of facial muscles during an expression. The magnitude of strain was found using optical flow over different regions of the face. Pfister et al.  [27]  used temporal interpolation model to address variable video length problem. They introduced spatiotemporal local texture descriptors to generate feature vector and finally, various kinds of classifiers have been tried to classify the micro-expression. Huang et al.  [9]  proposed a spatiotemporal completed local quantized pattern that extracts sign, magnitude and orientation components from an expression and constructed a codebook for each component that holds more dynamic pattern representations. Liu et al.  [20]  proposed a method that generates a compact feature vector by finding main directional mean optical flow using optical flow field over different regions of interest of the face. The final feature vector is fed into an SVM to classify micro-expressions. Zhao et al.  [44]  proposed a computationally compact feature using Local Binary Pattern -Three Orthogonal Planes (LBP-TOP) which can efficiently extract co-occurring features from neighboring points. Lu et al.  [22]  proposed a fusion based feature that finds differentials of optical flow over horizontal and vertical components. The fused feature vector is fed into an SVM classifier for classification.",

      "text": "Learning based Methods. In most of the computer vision applications, the deep learning techniques outperform the handcrafted feature based methods due to its increased feature learning capability from the data  [16] . Patel et al.  [25]  proposed a deep learning model for micro-expression recognition, where they used transfer learning to initialize the CNN with weights of a CNN trained on largely available macro-expression data to avoid overfitting. Takalkar implemented a variety of data augmentation techniques to generate synthetic data, resembling different environments to deal with lack of training data. Finally a CNN is applied to classify micro-expressions  [34] . Qiuyu et al.  [18]  proposed a three step algorithm where a multi-task CNN was used to find the facial landmarks. Deep CNN was used to calibrate the optical flow features from different facial regions. Finally, an SVM was employed to classify the micro-expressions. Liong et al.  [5]  collected the optical flow feature for each micro-expression and used it as input to a CNN for classification. Li et al.  [17]  proposed a 3D flow based CNN that uses gray scale images along with components of optical flow in different directions as input to classify micro-expressions. Wang et al.  [36]  proposed an image based residual model that uses microattention units and transfer learning to classify micro-expressions. The model fails to consider temporal information across the frames, which is important for micro-expression videos. Several proposals can be found in the literature  [12] [13] [14]  that used two step architecture where, a CNN is applied on each frame of the micro-expression video to generate spatial features and then a Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) based Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) is used to learn the temporal inter-dependencies between different spatial features from previous step. Reddy et al.  [30]  proposed a 3D CNN based model that tries to capture both spatial and temporal information in a micro-expression video simultaneous using 3D kernels. Liong et al.  [19]  proposed a shallow triple stream 3D CNN that uses optical strain, horizontal and vertical flows from the onset and apex frames to classify micro-expressions.\n\nThe existing methods focus neither on the minute spatial changes on face regions during micro-expressions nor on the temporal cues, as the micro-expressions last for a small span of time. A spatial attention mechanism can help in capturing the minute spatial changes in facial regions during micro-expression. In addition to that, a temporal attention can help in focusing on the smaller span of the micro-expression.",

      "text": "The process of human perceptual analysis is based on the attention mechanism  [24] . Human vision obtains the target area within the scene, that needs to be focused on, and pays more attention on the target area to obtain more detailed information about the scene that helps to capture the visual structure of the target better  [15] . Attention mechanism is used to find the region of interest within an image and to highlight the representation of the region of interest  [10] . The two main aspects of attention mechanism in deep learning are (a) to obtain the meaningful channels for the respective input feature and (b) to pay attention to the most informative channels to obtain the salient locations.\n\nRecently, several studies attempted to apply attention mechanism to enhance the performance of CNNs in a range of visual tasks (especially the tasks where objects play vital roles), such as image classification, image localization and video understanding  [1, 33] . Wang et al.  [37]  proposed a Residual Attention Network (RAN) which uses a trunk-and-mask module to incorporate an attention mechanism. By re-weighting the feature map, the network not only performs well but is also robust to input noise. Hu et al.  [8]  introduced a Squeeze-and-Excitation module to exploit the inter-channel relationship. Adding to this, Woo et al.  [38]  introduced spatial attention to further improve the image classification performance. In  [26] , Peng et al. designed an attention branch that helps to spotlight finger micro-gesture and reduces the noise introduced from the background and wrist. The spatial attention has improved the recognition accuracy by 3%. However the attention block proposed in the study of  [26] , increased the parameters by about 2𝑀. Similarly, for micro-expression recognition, an attention mechanism helps the model to focus on the face and important facial regions, and suppress the irrelevant facial areas and background.\n\nThe existing attention based mechanisms have not yet utilized the 3D channel and spatio-temporal attentions, which are important in the context of facial micro-expression recognition. In this work, we design a novel and effective 3D residual attention mechanism to simultaneously learn fine and subtle features along spatial, temporal and channel dimensions. The proposed attention modules, including channel attention and spatio-temporal attention, add just a few parameters to the base model, so that the increase in computation overhead is negligible. Next we illustrate the proposed method for micro-expression recognition.",

      "text": "The spatio-temporal attention captures the weight for each spatiotemporal feature volume. However, it is not able to distinguish the weight among the different channels of feature volume. Thus, we also propose a channel attention block in the residual framework. The channel features in the CNNs are exploited extensively to extract more discriminative features. We compute a channel attention map by utilizing the inter-channel relationship of features. The channel attention map focuses on finding the meaningful channels for the respective input feature volume. Integrating a channel attention map helps to improve the learning ability of the model by re-calibrating the channels of the input feature volume with increased or decreased weight. In order to capture the channel attention effectively for a feature volume (F\n\n), first we squeeze the spatial and temporal dimensions of the input feature volume by applying average pooling and max pooling and then we combine the squeezed features by concatenating them.

We propose two design choices for the shared sub-network. One variant is with the convolutional layers and other with the multi-layer perceptron layers (MLP). Our experimental results show that the shared network with convolutions is better than the MLP. The detailed analysis will follow in experimental results in Section 4. The shared convolutional network consists of a convolution layer with the channel reduction mechanism (through 1 × 1 × 1 convolution) to reduce the computation overhead.

      "text": "Experiments are conducted by training both the 3D residual network and the proposed 3D residual attention network models. The results are compared in terms of the facial micro-expression recognition accuracy. The performance of the proposed residual attention network is compared with the state-of-the-art hand-crafted methods (HCM) and deep learning methods (DLM) as shown in Table  1 . The results are computed over three benchmark facial microexpression datasets, including CASME I, CASME II, and CAS(ME) 2 in Table  1 . Note that the results of competing methods are taken from the corresponding papers. Table  1  depicts that the proposed MERANet model outperforms the existing hand crafted and deep learning models with a significant margin. As expected, the channel attention and the spatio-temporal attention blocks help the residual network to learn better micro-level spatio-temporal features leading to the enhanced decision making for facial micro-expression recognition.\n\nThe total number of parameters for the original 3D ResNet model is 3, 31, 67, 811 which, for the proposed 3D MERANet model, is increased to 3, 35, 47, 552. The proposed model uses 1.72 GFLOPs whereas original model uses 1.61 GFLOPs. The number of parameters increased for the proposed model by 3, 79, 741, and FLOPs increased by 0.11G, which is quite small compared to the original 3D ResNet model. So, the overall overhead added by the proposed attention module is negligible in terms of both parameters and computation. Table  2  represents the results in terms of the Accuracy, Precision, Recall and F1 measures for four benchmark datasets, including 𝐶𝐴𝑆𝑀𝐸𝐼 , 𝐶𝐴𝑆𝑀𝐸𝐼𝐼 , 𝐶𝐴𝑆 (𝑀𝐸) 2 , and 𝑆𝐴𝑀𝑀. Promising results are obtained using the proposed MERANet model for microexpression recognition. The quantitative results provided in Table  1  and Table  2  show the efficacy of the proposed attention modules. Table  3  shows the confusion matrix for the proposed method on the SAMM dataset.",

Inorder to fully capture the interrelationship, the channel descriptor of average pooling F 𝑐ℎ 𝑎𝑣𝑔 and max pooling F 𝑐ℎ 𝑚𝑎𝑥 are fed to a shared  Both the design choices are trained under the same settings. We observe that the residual attention model with shared CNN in the channel attention module work well compared to the model with the shared MLP in the shared network. Shared CNN works on the sliding window concept (which focuses on local regions of interest), whereas shared MLP works on the global feature connections. Due to the aforementioned property, shared CNN goes hand in hand with the attention module by improving the learning capability of the model. The loss curves for both the design choices are plotted in Fig.  5 . From the validation loss curve in Fig.  5 , we observe that the CN-SCNN outperforms the CN-SMLP at every epoch. Model trained with the CN-SCNN module converges faster compared to the model trained with the CN-SMLP. In conclusion, we infer that the shared CNN in the channel attention module is a better design choice compared to the shared MLP.",

      "text": "The performance of spatial-temporal attention block is mainly dependant on the applied convolution operation. In general, convolution layer performance depends on the size of the filter used. The kernel size plays a prominent role in extracting the subtle features. So, we have experimented with different kernel sizes, i.e., 3, 5, and 7 to find the optimal kernel size that boosts the model learning capability. The validation curve is shown in Fig.  6  having the plots corresponding to each kernel size. It is observed that the smaller kernel size (i.e., small receptive field) doesn't help the model to learn better. In contrast, higher kernel size (𝑘 = 7) increases the computation head, yet it fails to generalize better. From Fig.  6 , we also infer that a reasonable receptive field is needed for deciding important regions. In the comparison of different convolution kernel sizes, we find the kernel size of 5 helps the model to learn better micro-expression representation.",

In order to further understand the behavior of the proposed model, we have used the feature visualization technique proposed in  [31] . These feature visualizations help us to find which spatial locations trigger the classification outcome, thus providing the insights about the model's understanding of the emotions. The feature visualizations are given in Fig.  7 . According to  [4] , an emotion depicting disgust on a subject's face has facial muscle movements centered around the nose of the subject. Similarly, a happy emotion has facial muscle movements centered around the lip region. From Fig.  7 , we infer that the MERANet focuses on the face regions completely ignoring the background. Furthermore, it gives more weight to facial regions corresponding to an emotion. The saliency maps of 3D ResNet model seem to be very arbitrary by considering the noisy regions in the decision making process. Whereas, the saliency maps for the proposed MERANet model clearly matches the intuition with the general procedure of finding facial expressions and more convincing.",

The proposed 3D residual attention module utilizes the benefits of channel attention as well as spatio-temporal attention. These attention blocks help the proposed model to focus over the spatio-temporal features leading to the facial micro-expression recognition. We have conducted the extensive experiments with the proposed model over four benchmark datasets and compared with the state-of-the-art models. The proposed MERANet model outperforms the existing models with a negligible increase in the number of parameters. We also found that the shared CNN is better suitable with channel attention. However, the kernel size of 5 is better suitable with spatio-temporal attention.\n\nThe saliency map of the proposed MERANet model is very close to the human perception of the emotions in terms of the facial features contribution towards the identification of the emotions.",
