This paper introduces Affective-CARA, an agentic framework designed to enhance user-agent interactions by integrating a Cultural Emotion Knowledge Graph (derived from StereoKG) with Valence, Arousal, and Dominance annotations, culture-specific data, and cross-cultural checks to minimize bias. A Gradient-Based Reward Policy Optimization mechanism further refines responses according to cultural alignment, affective appropriateness, and iterative user feedback. A Cultural-Aware Response Mediator coordinates knowledge retrieval, reinforcement learning updates, and historical data fusion. By merging realtime user input with past emotional states and cultural insights, Affective-CARA delivers narratives that are deeply personalized and sensitive to diverse cultural norms. Evaluations on AffectNet, SEMAINE DB, and MERD confirm that the framework consistently outperforms baseline models in sentiment alignment, cultural adaptation, and narrative quality. Affective-CARA achieved a Cultural Semantic Density of 9.32 out of 10 and lowered cultural representation bias by 61% (KL-Divergence: 0.28), demonstrating robust performance in generating ethical, adaptive responses.",

      "text": "Affective computing systems designed to interpret and respond to human emotions has experienced rapid advancements, particularly driven by deep learning techniques and large-scale language models  (Yang et al., 2024) .\n\nDecades of cross-cultural psychology show that the way people express, perceive, and regulate emotion is strongly culture-bound. Concepts such as display rules and the \"in-group advantage\" demonstrate that identical facial or verbal cues can convey different affective meanings across societies, and observers decode emotions more accurately within their own culture group. Consequently, technologies that ignore culture risk misclassifying users' affect or delivering responses perceived as insensitive. These risks are amplified in sensitive domains such as mental-health support, education, and global customer service, where user trust is paramount.\n\nDespite recent progress, effectively addressing cultural variability in emotional expression remains a critical, yet unresolved challenge. Recent research underscores significant performance deterioration (approximately 20-40%) when affective computing models trained primarily on Western-centric datasets are deployed in culturally diverse contexts  (Pei et al., 2024; Hu et al., 2025) . These findings highlight persistent limitations in current emotion recognition and response generation frameworks, notably their inability to generalize well across different cultures due to inherently biased data and inadequate adaptive mechanisms  (Barthet et al., 2022; Zhao et al., 2024) .\n\nMost existing systems either (i) focus solely on improving cross-cultural recognition accuracy, or (ii) build static cultural profiles that cannot adapt in real time. Critically, they rarely close the loop that is, they do not convert cultural knowledge into adaptive emotional responses. No prior work unifies a structured representation of culture with a learning mechanism that tunes the agent's behaviour on-the-fly. Addressing this gap is essential for culturally inclusive, empathetic HCI.\n\nCurrent affective systems predominantly rely on universal-emotion taxonomies and static user-profiling methods  (Yang et al., 2024) . Although recent integration of knowledge graphs with large language models (LLMs) has demonstrated improvements in emotion understanding and response generation  (Wang et al., 2024; Sabour et al., 2024) , these approaches generally utilize Euclidean embeddings. Such flat representations fail to capture the inherent hierarchical and nuanced nature of cultural-emotional relationships, limiting their cross-cultural adaptability and often resulting in stereotyped or contextually inappropriate responses  (Li et al., 2023; Liang et al., 2024) .\n\nFurthermore, contemporary reinforcement learning approaches in affective computing typically neglect explicit cultural reward mechanisms, limiting their adaptive capabilities in culturally nuanced environments  (Dann et al., 2023; Pervez et al., 2024) . Consequently, existing methods inadequately address users' dynamic emotional needs, perpetuating biases and underscoring the necessity for culturally responsive frameworks  (Gilbert et al., 2023) .\n\nTo address these critical gaps, we introduce Affective-CARA (Culturally Adaptive Response Agent), an innovative framework specifically designed to generate culturally adaptive, emotionally intelligent responses. Affective-CARA uniquely integrates a hyperbolic Cultural Emotion Knowledge Graph enhanced with Valence-Arousal-Dominance (VAD) annotations and cultural alignment checks. This structure effectively captures hierarchical cultural relationships, significantly reducing representational bias. Moreover, our approach employs Gradient-based Reward Policy Optimization (GRPO) tailored explicitly to cultural appropriateness and emotional intelligence signals, allowing dynamic adaptation in response to real-time user feedback. Finally, the Cultural-Aware Response Mediator (CARM) systematically combines real-time inputs with historical emotional states and cultural insights, enabling deeply personalized narrative generation.\n\nSpecifically, our contributions are threefold.\n\n• CEKG: a hyperbolic knowledge graph that encodes hierarchical culture-emotion norms and lowers representation bias by 61 % (vs. a SenticNet-GPT baseline, p < .01).\n\n• GRPO: a novel RL strategy that optimises responses for cultural appropriateness and emotional coherence in real time.\n\n• CARM: a meta-controller that unifies recognition, cultural reasoning, and narrative generation, enabling end-to-end adaptive emotional interaction.\n\nComprehensive evaluations conducted across culturally diverse datasets including MERD  (Lian et al., 2024) , EmpatheticDialogues  (Li et al., 2022), and SEMAINE (McKeown et al., 2012)  demonstrate that Affective-CARA consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods on metrics of cultural semantic richness, bias reduction, emotional appropriateness, and narrative quality.",

      "text": "The field of affective computing originated with vision for emotionally aware machines, launching early efforts that modeled emotion generically and overlooked individual or cultural differences. Later studies demonstrated that emotional expression and perception are highly culture-dependent, with models trained in one cultural context often performing poorly elsewhere  (Afzal et al., 2023) . While foundational agent models such as  (Mascarenhas et al., 2013)  incorporated static cultural profiles using Hofstede's dimensions, they could not learn or generalize beyond pre-defined cultural stereotypes.\n\nCulture profoundly shapes how emotions are expressed and perceived, yet traditional NLP benchmarks often ignore these nuances.  Belay et al. (2025)  introduce CuLEmo, a benchmark for culture-aware emotion understanding across six languages, explicitly designed to require nuanced cultural reasoning  (Belay et al., 2025) . Their findings show that emotion concepts and model performance vary significantly with cultural context, underscoring that \"emotion conceptualizations vary significantly across languages and cultures\". Similarly,  (Deas et al., 2024)  present MASIVE, a dataset of over 1,000 unique affective states in English and Spanish, to move beyond a fixed set of basic emotions. They note that basic emotion categories (e.g. anger, joy) are insufficient for textual data, as \"culture, language, and dialect can influence how particular emotions are interpreted\". Their models show improved performance when trained on native, culturally-specific data, highlighting the importance of culturally grounded emotional lexicons.\n\nLarge Language Models (LLMs) trained on predominantly Western data often exhibit cultural bias, favoring certain norms or dialects  (Li et al., 2024) . This can lead to harm and unfair performance for under-represented groups. For example,  (Hofmann et al., 2024)  demonstrate that an AI system produced \"covertly racist decisions\" based solely on a user's dialect. In a similar vein,  (Deas et al., 2023)  evaluate GPT-style models on African American English and find significant performance gaps compared to mainstream English, indicating bias and lack of understanding of that dialect's linguistic features. These studies emphasize the need for culturally inclusive models. Indeed,  (Cao et al., 2024)  probed ChatGPT using Hofstede's cultural values survey and found a \"distinct disparity between the system and human society\" in value alignment.  (Arora et al., 2023)  likewise report that pretrained language models encode different value judgments across cultures. Such analyses confirm that current LLMs are not culture-neutral; they carry latent cultural assumptions that can misalign with users from diverse backgrounds. Researchers have called for pluralistic alignment models that can flexibly accommodate multiple cultural value systems.  (Saha et al., 2025)  even argue that beyond factual cultural knowledge, an LLM needs a \"metacultural competence\", the ability to handle completely unseen cultures by understanding cultural variation itself. Our work directly addresses these concerns by enabling real-time adjustment of a model's behavior to a target culture, rather than assuming one-size-fits-all emotional responses.\n\nBuilding dialogue agents that adapt to the user's cultural context is a nascent but growing area.  (Cao et al., 2024)  present cuDialog, the first multi-turn dialogue dataset with cultural labels, and demonstrate that incorporating cultural value features (derived from sociological surveys) can \"boost alignment with references and cultural markers\" in generated dialogues. In their framework, a dialogue model infused with cultural dimension vectors produced more personalized, culturally appropriate responses, improving both BLEU and diversity metrics. This result aligns with  (Ng et al., 2023) , who developed an emotion-aware mental health chatbot for the Malaysian context. They found that being mindful of the user's cultural background and responding with empathy greatly enhanced user engagement. In a user study, adding local cultural adaptation (e.g. Malay language content and culturally relevant examples) alongside emotional sensitivity led to significant gains in chatbot effectiveness and usability. These works show that cultural customization, from surface language (code-switching, local idioms) to deeper norms (what is considered respectful or comforting) can markedly improve human-agent communication.\n\nSeveral efforts tackle cultural adaptation by augmenting data or prompting strategies.  (Li et al., 2024)  takes an innovative simulation-based approach to generate cultural dialogue data. It uses multiple LLM agents role-playing different cultures to produce realistic cross-cultural conversations encapsu-lating beliefs, norms, and customs. With 41k generated dialogues, they finetune culture-specific models that match or outperform GPT-4 on culturallyinformed tasks like content moderation and value alignment. This indicates that targeted data augmentation can mitigate the Western-centric bias of base models, yielding agents more aligned to non-Western values (e.g. scoring higher on Hofstede's cultural dimensions tests). Other researchers focus on retrieval-based methods for cultural knowledge. For instance,  (Friedrich et al., 2023)  propose augmenting LLM prompts with relevant cultural context from a knowledge base when answering moral or norm-related questions. By retrieving, say, country-specific social norms and adding them to the query, the model can produce responses infused with the appropriate cultural nuance. This dynamic retrieval approach is promising for real-time cultural adaptation, ensuring the agent's knowledge remains upto date with evolving cultural information.\n\nDespite these advances, most systems handle culture as a static attribute (e.g. training separate models per culture  (Li et al., 2024)  or conditioning on a fixed cultural vector  (Cao et al., 2024) ). They lack the ability to continuously learn and adjust to a user's cultural cues in real time. Furthermore, prior culturally adaptive agents have largely focused on either style (politeness, wording) or content (factual knowledge), rather than affective responses. There remains a gap in modeling how different cultures prefer emotional expressions, for example, the appropriate level of enthusiasm, empathy or self-disclosure. This is precisely the gap our work addresses, we enable an agent to dynamically modulate its emotional responses according to cultural feedback signals, using reinforcement learning to fine-tune for culturally appropriate affect.\n\nRecent advances have seen the adoption of large-scale knowledge graphs for affective reasoning. Resources like SenticNet  (Hemaspaandra et al., 2014)  and ATOMIC  (Seo et al., 2019)  provide extensive affective and causal knowledge but do not encode cultural variability. Even recent emotion-centric knowledge graphs-such as ECoK  (Wang et al., 2024)  and EmoTransKG  (Zhao et al., 2024)  -enrich emotional context, but treat culture as a background factor or ignore it entirely. Consequently, these systems often produce responses that are emotionally plausible yet culturally inappropriate.\n\nA related line of work uses graph embeddings to structure affective knowledge. While most prior work has relied on Euclidean embeddings, recent studies show that hyperbolic embeddings are superior for modeling complex hierarchical relationships a crucial property for representing cultural-emotional nuance  (Nickel and Kiela, 2017; Balažević et al., 2019) . However, this geometric innovation has rarely been applied to cultural adaptation in affective computing.\n\nIn parallel, reinforcement learning (RL) has been used to make dialogue agents more adaptive and emotionally aware. Recent RL-based agents include affective rewards to improve empathy  (Steinborn et al., 2022; Zhu et al., 2024 ), yet they typically optimize for universal or Western affective norms and lack structured, culture-aware reward signals. As a result, these agents often struggle to personalize responses across diverse cultures and may reinforce existing biases  (Afzal et al., 2023) .\n\nA major gap in current literature, is the lack of systems that can dynamically personalize emotional intelligence and empathy using explicit, structured knowledge of cultural norms, while also adapting via learning. Attempts to combine these advances have either stopped at static culture encoding  (Mascarenhas et al., 2013) , missed hierarchical modeling  (Sap et al., 2019; Wang et al., 2024)  or used RL without cultural awareness  (Steinborn et al., 2022) .\n\nAffective-CARA directly addresses these limitations by integrating three key advances. First, it constructs a hyperbolic Cultural Emotion Knowledge Graph (CEKG), enabling efficient, hierarchical, and explicit modeling of culture-emotion relationships-far beyond what flat or static representations achieve. Second, it introduces a GRPO reinforcement learning strategy, which leverages structured cultural knowledge to guide response optimization, not just for empathy but for culturally congruent adaptation. Third, through the Cultural-Aware Response Mediator (CARM), Affective-CARA enables continual updating of user context, producing personalized and culture-sensitive interactions at scale.\n\nWhile prior works have advanced emotion recognition and empathy in AI, they have fallen short in dynamically combining cultural knowledge, hierarchical representation, and adaptive learning. By addressing these unresolved problems, Affective-CARA offers a comprehensive, generalizable solution for culturally adaptive affective agents.",

Additionally, we conducted human evaluations to assess emotional appropriateness in charged scenarios and utilized standard NLP metrics (perplexity, BLEU, ROUGE) alongside human judgments to evaluate narrative quality.\n\nFor comparative evaluation, we benchmarked Affective-CARA against three baseline systems: a standard large language model without cultural adaptation, a system using conventional Euclidean knowledge graph embeddings, and a system employing static user profiles for personalization. Each system was evaluated across multiple dimensions including cultural interpretation accuracy, emotional response appropriateness, personalization effectiveness, and bias mitigation capabilities using standardized scenarios designed to test cultural adaptation in emotionally charged contexts.\n\nTo determine the contribution of individual components, we conducted systematic ablation studies by selectively removing or replacing key elements of the system.

In all cases, Affective-CARA outperforms strong baseline models (including a state-of-the-art general LLM like Qwen2.5-Omni and a knowledge-enhanced empathy model without cultural knowledge), especially in scenarios requiring nuanced cultural adaptation.\n\nWe evaluated on two textual datasets, MERD (for cross-cultural emotion recognition), EmpatheticDialogues (for open-domain empathetic response), and SEMAINE (for conversational affective appropriateness using textual transcripts). This multi-dataset approach enables a nuanced assessment of both multicultural adaptation and general empathetic response generation. Baseline models included Qwen2.5-Omni (general LLM), E-KG (Affective-CARA with Euclidean KG embeddings), SP (static personalization), EmoTransKG (emotion transition model)  (Zhao et al., 2024) , and ECoK+GPT-3.5 (knowledge-graph-enhanced LLM)  (Wang et al., 2024) . Performance was measured using Cultural Semantic Density (CSD), KL-divergence (cultural bias), human-rated emotional appropriateness, BLEU-4, and ROUGE-L. F1 scores for emotion prediction were computed by cultural subgroup on MERD.\n\nAffective-CARA achieved the highest scores in every metric, substantially outperforming all baselines. Statistical significance was confirmed for improvements over ECoK+GPT-3.5 (p < 0.001, paired t-test).",

      "text": "This work demonstrates, for the first time, that a conversational AI can comprehensively adapt to the user's cultural context in real time while generating emotional responses. Affective-CARA directly tackles an open challenge that previous affective dialogue systems left unsolved. Prior research on empathetic chatbots focused on recognizing user emotions and replying with empathy, but these systems assumed a universal style of emotional expression and did not account for cultural differences. Likewise, most emotion recognition studies and benchmarks consider accuracy within a single cultural setting. The system not only achieves superior metrics across the board but also exhibits robust generalization across cultural subgroups, a recognized gap in prior work  (Zhao et al., 2024; Wang et al., 2024) . In contrast, Affective-CARA is explicitly designed to fill this gap by integrating culture-specific affective knowledge into both understanding and generation.\n\nThe results confirm that our model can generate responses that are not only empathetically relevant but also culturally appropriate on the fly. This realtime cultural adaptation is a novel capability, previous agents might detect that a user is sad or angry, but they would respond with a fixed style (often Western-biased or neutral) regardless of who the user is. Our work shows that by incorporating cultural context, an AI agent can respond to a sad user from Tokyo differently than it would to a sad user from New York, all without any manual intervention. This advancement makes Affective-CARA uniquely effective in multicultural settings, addressing a key limitation of earlier empathetic dialogue models.\n\nAblation studies confirm the indispensability of each architectural innovation, particularly hyperbolic KG embeddings and GRPO-driven adaptation. The culturally adaptive generation capabilities of Affective-CARA stem directly from its architectural design. The integration of the Cultural-Emotion Knowledge Graph (CEKG) with explicit cultural tagging provides structured, culture-specific affective norms, enabling the model to select appropriate response strategies across diverse contexts-functionality absent in culture-agnostic models. Unlike prior empathetic systems that use only generic knowledge graphs, our approach leverages culturally contextualized cues for response generation. Additionally, the unified multi-task framework-jointly training on emotion recognition and response generation aligns affect recognition with downstream response selection. Ablation studies confirm that both CEKG and cultural tagging are essential: removing them significantly reduces adaptive performance and leads to generic, less appropriate responses. These innovations are not just performance enhancers but critical enablers of real-time cultural emotional intelligence.\n\nComparative analysis with recent benchmarks, including ECoK+GPT-3.5 and EmoTransNet, further highlights the benefits of integrating structured cultural knowledge with dynamic learning mechanisms. Whereas previous models achieve incremental gains on standard metrics, they fail to sustain performance in non-Western contexts and do not systematically address cultural representation bias. Affective-CARA's capacity to generate stable, culturally aware narratives sets it apart from these approaches.\n\nNonetheless, some limitations persist. Performance on low-resource cultures not represented in the knowledge base and on highly mixed-emotion prompts remains suboptimal, suggesting avenues for future improvement through expanded KG coverage and finer-grained emotion modeling. Additionally, all experiments were conducted on text-based dialogue; extend-ing the framework to multimodal inputs or additional languages represents promising directions for subsequent work.\n\nAffective-CARA significantly advances the field of culturally inclusive conversational AI, combining strong technical performance with simulated interactive evaluation. Its modular design and superior cross-cultural generalization establish a robust foundation for future research on empathetic and globally relevant affective agents.",

By leveraging hyperbolic embeddings in the Cultural Emotion Knowledge Graph (CEKG), Gradient-Based Reward Policy Optimization (GRPO), and the Cultural-Aware Response Mediator (CARM), Affective-CARA achieves significant improvements in cultural adaptation, emotional appropriateness, and narrative quality.\n\nOur experimental results demonstrate that Affective-CARA consistently outperforms baseline systems, including Qwen-LLM, across multiple metrics. The framework achieved a Cultural Semantic Density (CSD) score of 9.32/10, reduced cultural representation bias by 61% (KL-Divergence: 0.28), and improved emotional appropriateness by 39% compared to standard RLHF implementations. Furthermore, ablation studies highlighted the critical contribution of hyperbolic embeddings, VAD annotations, and GRPO in achieving these results.\n\nAffective-CARA's ability to maintain stable performance across diverse cultural contexts underscores its potential for real-world applications in domains such as mental health support, cross-cultural education, and global customer service. By integrating structured cultural knowledge with dynamic response generation mechanisms, Affective-CARA sets a new standard for inclusive and empathetic human-computer interactions.",

Technically, integrating multimodal inputs (e.g., visual and auditory cues), adopting federated learning for privacy-preserving personalization, and implementing continuous learning for cultural drift detection would significantly enhance system robustness. Theoretically, exploring advanced geometric representations of culturalemotional relationships, developing standardized cross-cultural evaluation metrics, and investigating causal models of cultural influences on emotions could strengthen conceptual foundations. Practically, deploying Affective-CARA in mental health interventions, culturally adaptive educational systems, and global customer service platforms could substantially increase real-world impact. Ongoing refinement of ethical safeguards, including enhanced bias mitigation, transparent cultural knowledge representations, and robust privacy measures will ensure responsible, inclusive, and trustworthy AI deployment.",
