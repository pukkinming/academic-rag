      "text": "Microblog, an online-based broadcast medium, is a widely used forum for people to share their thoughts and opinions. Recently, Emotion Recognition (ER) from microblogs is an inspiring research topic in diverse areas. In the machine learning domain, automatic emotion recognition from microblogs is a challenging task, especially, for better outcomes considering diverse content. Emoticon becomes very common in the text of microblogs as it reinforces the meaning of content. This study proposes an emotion recognition scheme considering both the texts and emoticons from microblog data. Emoticons are considered unique expressions of the users' emotions and can be changed by the proper emotional words. The succession of emoticons appearing in the microblog data is preserved and a 1D Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) is employed for emotion classification. The experimental result shows that the proposed emotion recognition scheme outperforms the other existing methods while tested on Twitter data.",

      "text": "Emotion often refers to a complex state of feeling such as happiness, joy, anger, disgust, fear, love, and hatred that occurs in physical and psychological changes and has an impact on one's thinking and actions. Emotions can have a significant impact on people's lives. People's emotions can be expressed in a variety of ways, including speech, facial expressions, bodily gestures, verbal expressions using text, and so on  (Castellano et al., 2008; Murugappan et al., 2021; Singh et al., 2020) . Different social media platforms like Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, WhatsApp, Sina Weibo, etc. have grown in popularity in recent years where people express their emotions and thoughts  (Che et al., 2021; Wang et al., 2016) . Users share millions of tweets and posts every day. Therefore, social media contents are the most prospective sources for understanding emotional states and human thoughts.\n\nMicroblog, an online-based broadcast medium, is a widely used forum for people to share their thoughts and opinions. In our daily lives, microblogs make communication easier. Twitter  (Java et al., 2007) , LinkedIn, Facebook, Instagram, Snapchat, Tumblr, WhatsApp, etc. are the most popular microblogs. Globally, there are 3.5 billion users on social media, according to 2019 social media projections which equate to approximately 45% of the current population and this figure is only increasing  (Mohsin, 2020) . Any post can be hit immediately by a large number of people through microblogs. People express their thoughts by sharing posts that reflect one's sentiments.\n\nEmotion Recognition (ER) from microblog data is the most promising and challenging research finding in the field of information and communication technology. Unimodal, bimodal, and multimodal are the three possible categories of ER. Unimodal emotion recognition uses only one type of information, such as facial expression, text, or speech, whereas bimodal emotion recognition uses both speech and facial expression. This study introduces the unimodal emotion recognition method to determine one's Emotion Category (EC). Machine Learning (ML) based approach and knowledge-based approach  (Chaffar and Inkpen, 2011)  are two major techniques for identifying or recognizing emotions. The knowledge-based technique also known as the lexicon-based technique uses a set of rules to detect emotion from given data  (Nirenburg and Mahesh, 1997)  whereas the ML-based technique uses a model for learning the patterns from features generated from microblog data  (Kotsiantis et al., 2006) .\n\nDeep Learning (DL) based approaches for emotion recognition from microblog data have emerged remarkably and shown promising results nowadays. DL employs different architectures to learn the patterns in data. There are two major steps in DL-based emotion recognition from microblog data: (i) Processing data and (ii) classifying them using the proper DL model. Firstly, the collected data is processed, transformed, and represented in the appropriate format for the envisioned DL model. Secondly, a DL model is prepared or trained with the data to classify emotion. Along with different processing techniques, different DL models are investigated in the last several years for emotion recognition  (Batbaatar et al., 2019; Guo et al., 2021a) . These DL-based methods run on preprocessed data and do not include explicit functionality  (Batbaatar et al., 2019; Yang et al., 2018) . Some experiments consider emoticons along with the text as input data, while others only consider the text.\n\nThis research aims to develop an improved CNN based emotion recognition model from microblogs considering both text and emoticons. This study takes into account emoticons as they have a substantial significance to users' emotions and represented them by corresponding emotional words. The word and emoticon sequences that appeared in the microblog are preserved in this study. Considering all other pre-processing steps, CNN is applied for emotion recognition since it is pertinent for sequential data classification. Experiments using Twitter data on texts with emoticons and texts-only showed the effectiveness of the proposed CNN approach, with better classification accuracy considering both emoticons and texts compared to classification accuracy when only considering texts.\n\nThe remaining paper is structured as follows. At first, it reviews different existing works related to emotion recognition, and then the proposed CNN method is explained. After that, the experimental studies and results are demonstrated. Lastly, the paper concludes with a few remarks.",

      "text": "Many DL-based approaches are examined in the last several years for emotion recognition from microblog data  (Islam et al., 2020; Mehta et al., 2021) . Attention model  (Wei et al., 2019; Yuan and Zhang, 2021) , BERT RCNN  (Pan and Xu, 2021) , CNN  (Xu et al., 2020) , GRU  (Liu et al., 2021) , LSTM  (Arun et al., 2019; Batbaatar et al., 2019; Guo et al., 2021b; Islam et al., 2021) , graph convolution network  (Lai et al. 2020) , etc., are most prominent techniques employed in this research domain. Most of the methods only consider textual data  (Xu et al., 2020)  and a few consider both text and emoticons  (Islam et al., 2020) .  Yang et al. (2018)  developed an enhanced CNN method considering both emoticons and texts. They represented the emoticons and words as two separate vectors and projected into one emotional space. Then CNN is employed for emotion classification. The proposed model is applied to the Twitter dataset, NLPCC2013, and Weibo dataset.\n\nThe work proposed by  Islam et al. (2020)  also took both the emoticons and texts as input where it applied LSTM to classify emotions. The Twitter dataset was used to measure the efficacy of the model; however, the dataset was small enough. The work was then extended by  Islam et al. (2021)  and achieved remarkable accuracy with a relatively large dataset.  Batbaatar et al. (2019)  introduced a Semantic Emotion Neural Network (SENN) model that includes both CNN and BiLSTM for ER. Here, the CNN model focused on the emotional connectivity between words after extracting emotional features, while the BiLSTM was employed to build the semantic relationship after collecting contextual information. The SENN used Twitter data and other social media data (only text) without specifying whether or not emoticons were used in the decision-making process.  Wei et al. (2019)  developed an emotion recognition approach by incorporating both the dual attention mechanism and Bidirectional Long Short-term Memory (BiLSTM). In their work, they first used the BiLSTM model to semantically encode the microblog data and then introduced the sentiment word attention and self-attention into the BiLSTM model. Lastly, they used the Softmax classifier to classify the sentiment of microblogs. Chinese microblog Sina Weibo-based NLPCC2013 and NLPCC2014 datasets are used for the experimental purpose.\n\nAnother attention-based dual-channel microblog emotion recognition model is developed by  Yuan and Zhang (2021) . This study used RoBERTa-WWM and the multi-head attention model for their work. They constructed the emotional knowledge set of each sentence extending the emotional resource library and used the pretraining model RoBERTa-WWM for feature representation. After that, the Text CNN-BiGRU network and a Multi-Head Attention network took the sentence feature and the emotional knowledge as input to obtain deeper semantics features and attention features of emotional knowledge. And finally, the semantic feature and the emotional knowledge attention feature are combined to train the model. Chinese microblog NLPCC2014 dataset is used to show the efficacy of the model.  Pan and Xu (2021)  developed a deep learning-based sentiment analysis model employing BERT RCNN for netizens during public health emergencies. They used BERT which uses static masking for fine-tuning the input data and trained them into vectors to represent it. Then it took the trained vectors as the input features of the upstream model and learned the microblog data features through RCNN network. In contrast, the work proposed by  Yuan and Zhang (2021)  used dynamic masking incorporated in RoBERTa making the model more robust.\n\nAnother model, called Semantic Emoticon Emotion Recognition (SEER)  (Liu et al., 2021) , used both the attention mechanism and Bi-GRU (bidirectional gated recurrent unit) network to classify emotion. Then they constructed an emoticon distribution model to obtain the emotion vectors.",

      "text": "Social media has been the most common medium of venting feelings in the era of globalization  (Gräbner et al., 2012; Guo et al., 2021b; Wu et al., 2020; Xu et al., 2020) . People share their thoughts by posting videos, texts, audio, photos, etc. to express emotions. Microblogs are the most popular among them. Millions of words, images, videos, audio, hashtags, and various signs and symbols with various meanings can be found on microblogs. One of the most widely used microblogging platforms is Twitter. Since emoticons reinforce the meaning of content, they should be given special consideration in emotion recognition along with texts.\n\nThe emoticon and its interactions with texts are given particular consideration in the proposed method. To identify the true emotion of people, both emoticons and text possess equal significance. Several pieces of research in the literature have described emoticons as noisy inputs that should be omitted during the pre-processing stage  (Hogenboom et al., 2013)  but this should not be. The proposed model did proper emotion analysis with the aid of emotional words and other texts in the microblog.\n\nThe working procedure of the proposed emotion recognition model is demonstrated in Fig.  1  for a sample post with an emoticon. The proposed CNN scheme contains four consecutive phases. A lookup table is used in Task 1 to translate emoticons into corresponding emotion words. In Task 2, Integer Encoding (IE), the Task of converting words into a series of integers, is done. Then in Task 3 padding is done to make an equal-length vector sequence of integers. Finally, CNN is applied to recognize specific emotions (Sad, Happy, Angry, or Love) in Task 4.\n\nThe whole methodology where four individual processes are shown is described in Algorithm 1. Data processing and CNN classification are two major tasks in this algorithm. The first three processing steps are under data processing. In the following subsections, the steps are described briefly.",

      "text": "One of the most critical phases in our developed scheme is to process microblog data. Among several social platforms' data, Twitter data is used including both emoticons and text. Certain pre-processing steps are required to eliminate unnecessary content and noisy input from the data. Case conversion, user name removal, hashtag, punctuation mark removal, and so on are all part of the cleaning process. Then the clean microblog data containing both texts and emoticons is processed into three processes. Task 1 (emoticon conversion step) searches microblog data for emoticon(s) and then uses the Emoticon.meaning() function emoticons are replaced with corresponding meaning. Individual emoticon word meanings are stored in a lookup table used by the function. Needless information (if any) is eliminated and IE is achieved in the Tokenization step (Task 2) using the function Text_to_sequence(). In Task 3, padding is done using the pad_sequence() function to form equal length word vector sequence. Zero padding at first is performed in this case. Lastly, in Task 4, the CNN model is applied to recognize particular emotions (Happy, Love, Sad, or Angry).",

      "text": "CNN is a deep neural network very popular for analyzing visual 2D images. CNN has multiple layers having convolution and pooling operations. CNN's convolutional layers provide a summary of an image's features. By summarizing the presence of features of the feature map, pooling layers down samples feature maps. For images or image-like 2D inputs, the Conv2D layer architecture is primarily used in standard CNN. Finally, a fully connected layer is employed for classification purposes called Dense Layer.\n\nThis study considers CNN architecture with 1D convolutional operation on the blog text data mimicking the idea from CNN operation on time series data. For time-series data CNN uses Conv1D architecture (Amo-Boateng, 2020). As text data is considered timeseries data CNN employs the Conv1D architecture for ER. The kernel Conv1D slides in one dimensional way. Two Conv1D layers along with two max-pooling layers, a flattened layer, and two dense layers show promising outcomes in emotion recognition from text data. Generally, time-series data is used for forecasting or single output prediction but in our proposed method the output layer contains multiple nodes as emotion recognition is considered a multiclass problem.\n\nFigure  2  illustrates the CNN architecture of the developed scheme for emotion recognition from microblog data. CNN is popular for analyzing texts and recognizing their features or patterns of them. The architecture of the proposed scheme consists of an input layer, an embedding layer, two convolutional layers, two maxpooling layers, a flatten layer, two dense layers, and lastly the output layer. The size of the words used in the proposed model is the input dimension of the embedding layer and the output dimension is 128. The first and second convolutional layers have 64 and 32 dimensionalities of output spaces, respectively. Both convolutional layers use kernel size 3 and the relu activation function. For both max-pooling layers, the max-pooling window size is set to 2 and the pooling window moves 2 strides for each pooling step. The following flattened layer flattens the input. The first dense layer contains 16 with a relu activation function. As there are four possible class labels, the proposed CNN architecture ends with a dense layer with four nodes. To get the probability for each class the softmax activation function is used.",

      "text": "The proposed CNN model's main benefit is that it considers emoticons in addition to emotion recognition from real-life Twitter data. Only text data is directed to the proposed CNN method without emoticons and the influence of emoticons in emotion recognition is observed. Figure  3   It is also worth mentioning that although the training set accuracy of text-only is consistent with the proposed CNN architecture, in terms of test accuracy, it obtains higher results than the text-only case. At batch size 128, the proposed CNN method achieves 39.9% test accuracy for the text-only data within 10 epochs. In contrast, the scheme achieves 88.0% test accuracy considering both emoticon and text at batch size 32 within 10 epochs. In any machine learning system, higher test set accuracy is desired because it is the indication of the system's ability for generalization. More accuracy in the test set specifies that emoticon use in addition to text boosted the capability of learning the emotion properly of the proposed CNN method.   3  and 4  demonstrate the confusion matrices of the developed emotion recognition model for emoticons with text and text-only cases, respectively. Figure  3 (b) depicts the best test case accuracy for both cases. The differences between the predicted emotions and labeled emotions are shown in confusion matrices. These matrices depict four category-wise emotion recognition for emoticons with text and text-only cases. In terms of the test set, every category of emotion holds around 1000 tweets and the proposed CNN method accurately classifies 890 cases for the 'Angry' category which is the best performance using both text and emoticon data. The text-only case, on the other hand, performed best for the 'Sad' category, correctly classifying 429 out of 1000 cases. The other performance evaluation metric can be attained from the mentioned confusion matrices of the proposed CNN scheme for both cases.    and 15,000 sentences respectively. The model employed Bi-GRU architecture and achieved 85.76% accuracy for the NLPCC2013 dataset and 86.35% accuracy for the NLPCC2014 dataset. However, both datasets hold only 5400 sentences containing emoticons which might not produce a significant effect on classification. However, the proposed emotion recognition model with an 88.0% test set accuracy outperformed all other methods except  (Islam et al., 2021) . Showing competitive performance with  (Islam et al., 2021) , the proposed method has a significant contribution. For the emotion recognition model, CNN uses Conv1D architecture rather than the standard CNN Conv2D architecture that is most commonly used for imagery data. The proposed method successfully classifies emotion using CNN Conv1D architecture because text data is considered time series data. Finally, classification with CNN considering emoticons with texts has been revealed as a promising ER technique from microblog data.",

In the ML domain, emotion recognition from microblog data has emerged as a challenging and promising research finding. For emotion recognition, most of the existing methods consider only text data for simplicity which is not sufficient. In this study, an emotion recognition model using CNN is developed considering emoticons in addition to text. As emoticons can have a significant role in the emotional behavior of human beings using microblog data, the proposed CNN technique outperforms other emotion recognition methods considering emoticons in addition to text using real-life Twitter data. In summary, this research developed an emotion classification technique and the effectiveness of emoticon consideration in emotion recognition from microblog data.\n\nThis study opens some future research scopes in this area. This study added a significant wing in the field of emotion recognition from English microblogs. A similar concept may be suitable for other language microblogs. Moreover, the recognition system brings more realistic if emotional states like surprise and disgust can be considered, which remained for further research. Moreover, with a large dataset, the proposed CNN approach could produce a more realistic result.",
