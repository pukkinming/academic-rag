      "text": "Facial expression recognition (FER) can automatically perceive human emotions and has been widely applied in real-world scenarios such as psychological evaluation  [10, 11, 35] , and human-computer interaction  [6, 12, 44] . According to the data type, FER approaches can be divided into two categories: Static FER (SFER)  [26]  and Dynamic FER (DFER)  [47] . SFER methods focus on analyzing single still images to classify emotions  [29] , which limits their capacity to capture the dynamic progression and contextual transitions of expressions across time  [24] , leading to degraded performance in realistic settings that involve temporal complexity and motion variance. In contrast, DFER techniques utilize video sequences to model how facial expressions evolve over time, offering a more faithful representation of emotional dynamics. However, it is challenging to understand the spatiotemporal expressions in real scenarios.\n\nConsidering that facial expressions are usually subtle, transitory, and subject to spatio-temporal variations in the real world, pioneer works have been done to capture the subtle changes in expressions through temporal modeling. For example, recent DFER methods aim to model the temporal evolution and structural dynamics of facial expressions by integrating spatiotemporal cues through CNN-RNN pipelines  [18, 41] , unified 3D CNNs like I3D  [1]  and M3DFEL  [37] , or transformer-based attention mechanisms as in Former-DFER  [49]  and STT  [28] . Although these temporal modeling capabilities enhance the robustness and adaptability of DFER in real-world environments and further achieve impressive performances  [38] , several problems still need to be seriously addressed before widespread application. As illustrated in Fig.  1 , due to the lack of mechanisms to handle hard samples arising from real-world sample heterogeneity, which is extremely common and harmful, the biggest problem with existing DFER methods is poor generalization. The heterogeneity basically caused by data source differences, individual differences, and training dynamics. 1) Overlooking source-level heterogeneity undermines robustness to visual variation. DFER datasets are typically built from heterogeneous video sources such as movies, news, and interviews, which introduce substantial variations in visual style, resolution, compression, and motion continuity. These source-level discrepancies manifest as sample-level distributional variations, which make it difficult to learn consistent and discriminative representations. Without explicitly modeling the heterogeneity in visual styles and quality, models tend to overfit dominant patterns and struggle with underrepresented or atypical samples, ultimately degrading generalization under real-world conditions. 2) Individualinduced heterogeneity leads to hard samples and representation inconsistency. Variations in identity, expression patterns, age, and emotional intensity lead to significant individual-induced heterogeneity, where the same emotion is expressed in diverse and often inconsistent ways. This results in increased intra-category variation and a higher prevalence of hard or ambiguous samples during training, which undermines representation stability and degrades the reliability of learned decision boundaries. 3) Overlooking training dynamics under sample heterogeneity hinders optimization stability.\n\nIn the presence of sample heterogeneity, data-driven deep models often encounter optimization difficulties, such as fluctuating gradients and unstable convergence. Hard samples dominate training signals and may overwhelm classification loss, further leading to brittle representations.\n\nTo address the above challenges in DFER, inspired by the principles of Distributionally Robust Optimization, we propose a novel framework named Heterogeneity-aware Distributional Framework (HDF), which incorporates two plug-and-play DFER-enhancing modules that can be seamlessly integrated into existing generalpurpose video backbone networks. First, to construct more stable and generalizable expression representations under sample heterogeneity, we design the Time-Frequency Distributional Attention Module (DAM). By leveraging wasserstein-regularized temporal attention and frequency-domain adversarial perturbation to capture highly uncertain expression dynamics and suppress distributional variations in style and resolution, DAM adopts a dual-branch architecture to perform adaptive and robust modeling in both temporal and frequency domains. To further mitigate the optimization instability and representation degradation caused by hard samples, we introduce a novel Distribution-aware Scaling Module (DSM). By combining an information-constrained and reweighted supervised contrastive loss with a sharpness-aware loss scaling mechanism driven by gradient norm, DSM constructs a dual-enhanced optimization strategy that adaptively balances classification and contrastive learning objectives, thereby improving both the robustness and discriminability of learned representations under heterogeneous conditions.\n\nTotally, our main contributions can be concluded as follows:\n\n• To the best of our knowledge, this paper is the first attempt to introduce the principle of Distributionally Robust Optimization into DFER. By joint modeling of style variations, individual expression dynamics, and task-level distribution shifts across both feature and optimization levels, we construct HDF that explicitly addresses ubiquitous sample heterogeneity.",

      "text": "Dynamic Facial Expression Recognition (DFER) focuses on modeling temporal changes in facial expressions, capturing subtle emotional dynamics beyond static images. Early methods relied on handcrafted spatiotemporal features such as LBP-TOP  [48]  and HOG-TOP  [4] . However, the property of dependence on prior knowledge limited generalization. With the rise of deep learning, CNN-RNN frameworks became mainstream, which using CNNs ( e.g., VGG  [45] , ResNet  [13] ) for spatial encoding and LSTM/GRU  [20]  for temporal modeling. Unfortunately, such methods often struggle to capture long-range dependencies and are sensitive to distribution shifts, limiting their robustness in real-world scenarios. To jointly learn spatial and temporal features, 3D CNNs such as C3D  [34] , I3D  [1] , and M3DFEL  [37]  have been widely used. M3DFEL incorporates multi-instance learning to suppress noisy frames, while IAL  [21]  introduces intensity loss to enhance inter-category separability. However, these models often struggle with ambiguous boundaries and sample uncertainty.\n\nTo improve representation quality, state-of-the-art methods explore vision-language modeling  [3, 22, 27] , label-guided temporal fusion  [2] , or static-to-dynamic domain adaptation  [14, 16, 47] , aiming to leverage additional supervision. Yet, they are still constrained by reliance on large-scale pre-trained data and limited temporal reasoning capability. Transformer-based architectures have gained popularity due to their ability to capture long-range dependencies through self-attention mechanisms. For instance, former-DFER  [49]  and STT  [28]  integrate spatiotemporal attention to improve robustness against occlusion and motion variation. Nevertheless, these transformer-based DFER models inevitably face challenges in effectively handling sample heterogeneity, noisy transitions, and data distribution shifts, further limiting their applicability to complex real-world scenarios.",

      "text": "Distributionally Robust Optimization provides a principled framework for improving generalization under sample heterogeneity  [43] . Unlike conventional robust optimization that addresses local input perturbations  [19, 42] , Distributionally Robust Optimization minimizes the worst-case expected loss over a family of plausible data distributions, thereby accounting for global distribution shifts. These uncertainty sets are commonly defined using 𝜙-divergence  [7] , Wasserstein distance  [17, 33] , or structural constraints  [5] , which enable the model to handle latent distributional variations beyond observed data noise. Although recent work has extended Distributionally Robust Optimization with learnable uncertainty sets for cross-domain robustness  [31] , directly applying Distributionally Robust Optimization in high-dimensional and temporally-evolving tasks such as DFER still remains challenging.\n\nThus, in this work, we explore Distributionally Robust Optimization as a principled solution to cope with sample heterogeneity in DFER, which arises from variations in visual style, expression dynamics, and individual identity, etc. To address this, we propose heterogeneity-aware Distributionally Robust Optimization framework HDF tailored for DFER. Among HDF, DAM models sample heterogeneity in temporal dynamics and visual styles via dualbranch attention, while DSM stabilizes training under hard samples by adaptively balancing classification and representation objectives based on gradient sensitivity. Furthermore, these components form a unified heterogeneity-aware framework guided by Distributionally Robust Optimization, enabling robust learning from diverse and uncertain dynamic expression samples.",

      "text": "We adopt X3D  [8]   First, the input feature x ∈ R 𝐵×𝑇 ×𝐶 ×𝐻 ×𝑊 is passed through a DCT convolution to extract frequency features 𝑓 DCT . To simulate worst-case variations caused by source-level sample heterogeneity and enhance robustness to visual style shifts, adversarial perturbation introduce two types of regularized perturbations to the original frequency features. The first is a sign-based perturbation: 𝛼 •𝜖 • sign(𝑓 DCT ), where sign(•) denotes the element-wise sign function, generating adversarial noise along the gradient direction; 𝛼 is a learnable weight and 𝜖 is a fixed scaling factor. The second is a wasserstein-guided global shift:\n\n, where E[𝑓 DCT ] denotes the mini-batch mean of frequency features, reflecting the global distribution center; ∥ • ∥ 2 is the L2 norm, measuring the deviation between a sample and the global distribution; and 𝛽 is a learnable global perturbation weight. The resulting adversarial frequency feature is:\n\n(6) This design approximates the inner maximization problem in Distributionally Robust Optimization by jointly simulating input-level perturbations and feature-level distributional deviations, enabling the model to better handle frequency-domain variations caused by source-specific heterogeneity. To address activation instability from perturbations, we design a dynamic fitting function that adaptively scales activations:\n\nwhere 𝛼 is a learnable scaling factor, 𝛾 and 𝛽 are affine transformation parameters, and 𝜀 is a small constant for numerical stability. √︁ Var(𝑓 adv ) denotes the standard deviation for each sample, which reflects the dispersion of activation values. This function dynamically adjusts activation strength according to channel-wise feature statistics, mitigating inter-sample scale variation and improving robustness under visual heterogeneity.\n\nFinally, the dynamically activated feature 𝑓 dyn is processed by self-attention mechanism to obtain the attention map 𝑓 att , which is then fused with the original features:\n\nwhere 𝜎 (•) denotes the sigmoid function. In summary, the frequency branch improves feature robustness against source-induced style variation by jointly leveraging frequency decomposition, adversarial modeling, and adaptive activation fitting.\n\n4.1.2 Temporal Attention Branch: Sequence Consistency Modeling via Wasserstein Regularization. In DFER, individual expression differences exacerbate temporal inconsistencies in frame-level features, challenging consistent trajectory modeling. To mitigate this temporal heterogeneity, we introduce a temporal attention branch that enhances robustness against dynamic inconsistency and irregular expression rhythms.\n\nGiven the input feature 𝑥, we compute two temporal descriptors for each frame by applying global average pooling and max pooling over the channel and spatial dimensions, denoted as 𝐴 (𝑡 ) avg (global context) and 𝐴 (𝑡 ) max (local saliency), respectively. To measure the deviation of the current frame from the global expression trajectory, we introduce a wasserstein-inspired regularization term, approximated as the L2 distance between the average representation of the current frame and the global mean of the sequence:\n\n, which is used to identify outlier or drifting frames that compromise the temporal consistency of the expression sequence. To prevent this wasserstein term from suppressing genuine emotional transitions, we further introduce a local temporal difference term as a compensatory measure:\n\n, which enhances the model's sensitivity to short-term dynamic variations. We then fuse the above components using a gating mechanism to generate the final temporal attention map:\n\nwhere 𝛼, 𝛽, 𝛾, 𝛿 are learnable fusion weights and 𝜎 (•) denotes the sigmoid activation function. This attention map adaptively adjusts the contribution of each frame to the overall sequence representation. Finally, TA 𝑡,𝑡 ′ are passed through a self-attention mechanism to generate a temporal attention map TA, which adaptively highlights consistent frames and suppresses noisy or drifting ones. The attended sequence representation is then fused with the original temporal features as:\n\nwhere 𝜎 (•) denotes the sigmoid function. In summary, the temporal branch improves sequence-level consistency under heterogeneous conditions by integrating wasserstein-based global deviation detection, local dynamic compensation, and long-range temporal attention, providing robust and coherent temporal representations for the subsequent fusion module.",

In DFER, hard samples caused by sample heterogeneity not only increase feature distribution diversity but also significantly undermine the stability of positive-negative discrimination in contrastive learning. To address this, we propose an information bottleneck and Distributionally Robust Optimization enhanced SCL that effectively mitigates the instability caused by hard samples during training. First, to reduce the dominance of hard negative samples in the contrastive loss, we introduce a gaussian kernel-based reweighting strategy into SCL, assigning distributionally robust weights to each negative pair based on their similarity. This design suppresses the risk of overfitting to extreme samples at the distribution level.\n\nLet the normalized feature representations be 𝑧 𝑖 , 𝑧 𝑗 ∈ R 𝑑 , and the similarity between sample 𝑖 and 𝑗 is defined as:\n\n𝜏 , where 𝜏 is a temperature parameter. For each negative sample pair (𝑖, 𝑗), we construct a gaussian robust weight term based on the deviation of their similarity from the 𝜂: 𝑤 𝑖 𝑗 = exp -\n\n, where\n\n𝜂 is a hyperparameter that defines the center and smoothness of the gaussian weighting curve, reflecting the expected similarity between well-aligned features, and adjusts how strongly outlier negatives are down weighted.

This design significantly reduces the contribution of alignment errors with hard negatives in the loss function, thereby enhancing the stability of the optimization.\n\nOn the other hand, we further incorporate the information bottleneck principle by minimizing the mutual information between the representation and the input, aiming to compress redundant information and enhance the task relevance and discriminability of the learned features.
