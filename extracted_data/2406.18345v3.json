      "text": "Integrating prior knowledge of neurophysiology into neural network architecture enhances the performance of emotion decoding. While numerous techniques emphasize learning spatial and short-term temporal patterns, there has been limited emphasis on capturing the vital long-term contextual information associated with emotional cognitive processes. In order to address this discrepancy, we introduce a novel transformer model called emotion transformer (EmT). EmT is designed to excel in both generalized cross-subject EEG emotion classification and regression tasks. In EmT, EEG signals are transformed into a temporal graph format, creating a sequence of EEG feature graphs using a temporal graph construction module (TGC). A novel residual multi-view pyramid GCN module (RMPG) is then proposed to learn dynamic graph representations for each EEG feature graph within the series, and the learned representations of each graph are fused into one token. Furthermore, we design a temporal contextual transformer module (TCT) with two types of token mixers to learn the temporal contextual information. Finally, the task-specific output module (TSO) generates the desired outputs. Experiments on four publicly available datasets show that EmT achieves higher results than the baseline methods for both EEG emotion classification and regression tasks.

      "text": "E MOTION recognition using electroencephalography (EEG) plays an important role in brain-computer interface (BCI) assisted mental disorder regulation. It requires machine to perceive human emotional states from brain activities using artificial intelligence techniques  [1] ,  [2] . The predictions of emotions can be used for neurofeedback in the regulation process  [3] . Accurate predictions and fair generalization abilities to unseen subjects are crucial in building robust real-world BCI systems. Deep learning methods have shown promising results for accurate detection of brain activities  [4] ,  [5] . The design of the neural network architecture becomes crucial.\n\nIncorporating neurophysiological prior knowledge into neural network architectures improves emotion decoding performance  [6] ,  [7] ,  [8] . Common considerations include leftright hemisphere asymmetries, neurophysiologically meaningful graph connections, and the temporal dynamics of EEG signals. According to neuropsychological studies, the left and right hemispheres react differently to emotions, particularly in the frontal areas  [9] . Several deep learning methods  [8] ,  [10] ,  [11]  draw inspiration from this prior knowledge, achieving improved emotion decoding performance. EEG electrodes are placed on the scalp, which naturally forms a non-Euclidean structure. Therefore, many studies treat EEG signals as graphs, using either a neurophysiologically designed adjacency matrix  [7]  or a learnable one  [12] ,  [13] . However, there is still more prior knowledge that should be investigated. As one of the high-order cognitive processes in the brain, emotion consists of more basic processes such as attentional, perceptual, and mnemonic system processes  [14] . Different brain regions are cooperatively activated under different cognitive processes, e.g., frontal and parietal networks in attention  [15]  and medial temporal lobes, prefrontal cortex, and parietal cortex interactions for episodic memory  [16] . Using a pre-defined or a single learnable adjacency matrix cannot capture complex brain region connectives underlying emotional processes. Another prior knowledge about emotions is that emotional states are continuous in short periods while not consistent along the long stimuli  [17] . Less attention is paid to this temporal contextual information underlying emotions.\n\nTo address the above-mentioned problems, we propose a novel transformer-based structure, named emotion transformer (EmT), for both generalized cross-subject emotion classification and regression tasks. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to explore transformer-based structures on cross-subject EEG emotion classification and regression tasks together. To learn temporal contextual information, we represent EEG segments as temporal graphs, as shown in Figure  2 . We learn the spatial information of each EEG graph to form a token. Then the long-short time contextual information is learned upon the token sequence.\n\nWe propose a residual multi-view pyramid graph convolutional neural networks (GCN) module, named RMPG, to capture multiple EEG channel connections for different basic cognitive processes in emotions. Multiple GCNs with independent learnable adjacency matrices are utilized parallelly in RMPG. Different from  [18]  that uses multiple adjacency matrices among manually defined local groups, we learn the connections among all the EEG channels. The reasons are two-fold: 1) locally defined groups are special cases of a global connection in which the EEG channels are fully connected within each local group, and 2) more specific channel-wise connections can be learned. Those parallel GCNs have different numbers of layers that can learn multi-view and multi-level graph embeddings with the help of their learnable adjacency matrices. Together with the output of a residual linear projection branch, a feature pyramid is formed. A mean fusion is utilized to combine the information in the feature pyramid as one token. Hence, a temporal sequence of tokens is formed.\n\nWe further propose temporal contextual transformers (TCT) with different token mixers  [19]  to learn contextual information from the token sequence for EEG emotion classification and regression tasks. An EEG trial refers to the period when one type of stimuli, e.g., a happy movie clip, is presented to the subject while the EEG is recorded. The label of the entire trial is assigned as happy according to either the self-assessments or the stimulus contents in classification tasks. However, the emotional states of the subjects change along with the stimuli  [17] . Cutting each trial into short segments and assigning the same label to them will induce noisy labels  [7] . To relieve noisy label issues and learn temporal contextual information of emotions, we can use a longer sliding window with shortshifting steps to split each trial, and the longer segments are further cut into sub-segments. Multi-head self-attention (MSA) in transformers  [20]  can attentively emphasis the parts that are highly correlated to the overall emotional state of the longer EEG segment. Because emotion is continuous  [21] , the underlying state is consistent in a short period. Hence, we propose a short-time aggregation (STA) layer after MSA to learn the long-short-time contextual information. Different from classification tasks, the label is temporally continuous in regression tasks. The model needs to regress the continuous changes of the emotional states for all the segments within a sequence. Although MSA can globally emphasis important parts in the sequence, recurrent neural networks (RNN) can further fuse the information of all the segments recurrently. This causal information fusion ability makes RNN more suitable for regression task. Hence, we propose to use an RNNbased token mixer in TCT for the regression tasks instead of MSA. To this end, we propose TCT-Clas and TCT-Regr as the token mixers in EmT for EEG emotion classification and regression tasks.\n\nThe major contribution of this work can be summarised as:\n\n• We propose a novel Emotion Transformer (EmT) for generalized cross-subject EEG emotion classification and regression tasks. • We introduce a residual multi-view pyramid GCN (RMPG) module, designed to learn multi-view and multilevel graph embeddings using multiple learnable adjacency matrices. This approach incorporates neuroscience knowledge, recognizing that emotions are composed of various basic cognitive processes. • Two types of temporal contextual transformer (TCT) blocks with task-specific token mixers are proposed to capture temporal contextual information from EEG data, accounting for the differing learning objectives between classification and regression tasks.\n\n• Extensive experiments are conducted to evaluate and analyze the proposed EmT on four public datasets. Shanghai Jiao Tong University emotion EEG dataset (SEED)  [22] , the TsingHua University emotional profile dataset (THU-EP)  [23]  and the finer-grained affective computing EEG dataset (FACED)  [24]  are used for classification tasks while the multimodal database for affect recognition and implicit tagging dataset (MAHNOB-HCI)  [25]  is utilized for regression tasks. The results demonstrate the superior of EmT over the compared baseline methods.",

Spectral GNN is a category of GNN that often rely on expensive eigendecomposition of the graph laplacian, thus several methods use approximation approaches to perform spectral filtering. ChebyNet  [26]  uses Chebyshev polynomials to approximate the spectral filters. Cayley polynomials are utilized to compute spectral filters for targeted frequency bands, which are localized in space and scale linearly with input data for sparse graphs  [27] . The graph convolutional network (GCN) approximates spectral filtering with localized first-order aggregation  [28] . EEG signals naturally have a graph structure. While some methods use GNN/GCN to extract spatial information from EEG signals, several approaches  [7] ,  [12] ,  [13]  do not consider the interactions among multiple brain areas involved in high-level cognitive processes, relying instead on a single adjacency matrix. Additionally, most of these methods  [7] ,  [12] ,  [13] ,  [18]  neglect the temporal contextual information associated with emotional processes, using averaged features as node attributes. To effectively extract spatial relationships among EEG channels, we employ ChebyNet as the GCN layer in our model. Moreover, instead of solely using averaged features, we construct EEG signals as a sequence of spatial graphs to explicitly learn the temporal contextual information.",

The efficacy of prediction hinges on the development of a model capable of discerning crucial features that can distinguish between emotional classes. These extracted features typically encompass spectral, spatial, and temporal characteristics. Spectral features are typically derived through Fourierbased techniques, involving data filtering, and subsequent calculation of parameters like power spectral density (PSD) or differential entropy (DE). Alternatively, spectral filtering can be achieved by convolutions along the temporal dimension. Spatial features, on the other hand, are obtained through spatial convolution, often using convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and graph convolutional neural networks (GNNs).  [12]  propose DGCNN, a GCN-based network with a learnable adjacency matrix, to learn dynamical spatial patterns from differential entropy (DE) features. Based on DGCNN, a broad learning system (BLS) is added in graph convolutional broad network (GCB-Net)  [13] , which improves the emotion classification results.

Two steps are required to generate the temporal graphs from EEG, which are EEG segment/sub-segment segmentation and feature extraction, respectively. Figure  2  shows the construction process for one EEG segment.\n\nFirstly, EEG signals are split into short segments that are further split into several shorter sub-segments using sliding windows. Given one trial of c-channel EEG signals, denoted by X ∈ R c×L , it is split into short segment X ∈ R c×l using a sliding window of length l, with a hop step being s.

These adjacency matrices are randomly initialized with different values and can be dynamically adjusted using gradient backpropagation  [12] . Each A i can learn one view of graph connections that belongs to a certain basic cognitive process. For each Φ i g (•), stacking different layers of GCNs can learn different degrees of node cluster similarity  [34] . Intuitively, for localized connections, such as electrodes within a brain functional area, a deeper GCN can get a consistent representation among these nodes. However, for global connections that are among different brain functional areas, a shallow GCN can aggregate the information among these areas while not over smooth it. The deeper the Φ i g (•) is, the taller the feature pyramid level its output has. A linear projection layer, LP(•), is added for each Φ i g (•) to project the flattened graph representations into a hidden embedding denoted by H i g ∈ R dg .

      "text": "Two types of TCTs with different token mixers for classification and regression tasks are proposed to capture temporal contextual information of EEG underlying emotional processes. MetaFormer  [19]  shows that MSA can be replaced by different token mixers in transformers. We propose two types of token mixers with which we have EmT-Clas and EmT-Regr for EEG emotion classification and regression separately. EmT refers to EmT-Clas unless otherwise stated. Given S T = {s i } ∈ R seq×dg from RMPG, one block of TCT can be represented as:\n\nwhere m = [1, 2, ...] is the number of layers in TCT blocks, Z 0 = S T , and MLP has two linear layers with the ReLU activation in between. A dropout layer is added after each linear layer. 1) Token Mixers for Classification Tasks: For classification tasks, MSA is utilized in TokenMixer clas (•) to attentively emphasis the parts that are highly correlated to the overall emotional state of S T . The tokens in S T are then linearly projected into multiple groups of key (K i ), query (Q i ), and value (V i ) using multiple LP(•), parameterized by\n\nThe scaled dot-product is utilized as the attention operation along temporal tokens to capture long-time context:\n\nwhere d = d head is a scaling factor. Because we need to apply the proposed STA on separate outputs from heads, we just stack the head outputs in the formula below:\n\nMSA(S T ) = {Attn(LP 0 (S T ), ..., Attn(LP n head -1 (S T )}. (8) Considering the fact that emotion is short-term continuous and long-term varying  [17] , we propose a short-time aggregation (STA) layer after MSA to learn the long-short-time contextual information. A dropout layer with a scaling factor α, dp(α) is applied to control the forgetting rate of the temporal context. α is a hyper-parameter that will scale down the overall dropout rate in STA. To capture short-term consist patterns and smooth the effects of the changes in emotional states, CNN kernels denoted by K cnn whose size and step are (n anchor , 1), (1, 1) are utilized to aggregate n anchor temporal neighbors after MSA. Let H attn ∈ R n head ×seq×d head denotes one output of MSA. STA can be described as:  all equal n head . The same padding is utilized to avoid size changes before and after STA.

MSA emphasises the parts that are highly correlated to the overall emotional state within a sequence via SA. This is helpful for the classification task that requires a single output of the sequence. However, the regression task needs the model to predict the continuous changes in the emotional states for all the segments within the sequence. Because RNN-based token mixer can fuse the information of all the segments recurrently, it is more suitable for the regression task. The tokens in S T ∈ R seq×dg are projected into values (V ) using a projecting weight matrix, W v ∈ R dg×d head . Because the RNN-based token mixer can be RNN, LSTM, GRU, etc., we use RNNs to denote the RNN family. A two-layer bi-directional GRU whose output length is 2 * d head is empirically selected as the token mixer for EmT-Regr in this paper. Hence, TokenMixer regr can be described by: TokenMixer regr (S T ) = RNNs(LP(S T )),  (11)  where LP(S T ) = S T W v is a linear layer.",

This is because K decides how many hops from the central vertex the GCN can aggregate. If the number of EEG channels is relatively less, e.g., 32 in THU-EP and MAHNOB-HCI, K = 3.

On the SEED dataset, EmT-D achieves the highest accuracy (0.802) and the highest F1 score (0.821), indicating its effectiveness in emotion classification. EmT-B also performs well with an accuracy of 0.788 and an F1 score of 0.793, while EmT-S shows a slightly lower accuracy of 0.780 but a strong F1 score of 0.759. RGNN achieves the second-best performance on the SEED dataset with an accuracy of 0.790 and an F1 score of 0.802. Notably, the methods that use features as input generally perform better than those using EEG as input. Additionally, learning from the temporal sequence of features consistently achieves better performance than learning from the features directly, except in the case of RGNN. This indicates the effectiveness of learning the temporal contextual information. Furthermore, compared to TCN, LSTM, TESANet, and AMDET, EmT can learn the spatial information better with the help of the GCN-based modules.\n\nThe observations on the THU-EP and FACED datasets are different. For the THU-EP dataset, EmT-B achieves the best F1 score of 0.724, while Conformer achieves the best accuracy (0.601). On the FACED dataset, EmT-B leads with the second-best accuracy (0.608) and the highest F1 score (0.740). AMDET achieves the second-best F1 score of 0.726, while the best accuracy is achieved by TSception (0.619). As the classes are imbalanced in both the THU-EP and FACED datasets, F1 scores are more important than accuracy. EmT-B achieves the highest F1 scores on both THU-EP and FACED, demonstrating its effectiveness in emotion classification. Different from the observations on the SEED dataset, the baselines using EEG as input achieve better performance than those using features as input. This might be because there are more subjects in THU-EP and FACED, and using EEG directly can provide more information.\n\nFor the SEED dataset (62 channels, 15 subjects), there is a positive correlation between the number of transformer layers and performance, with EmT-D (8 layers) performing best due to the enriched spatial information from the higher number of channels. However, for the THU-EP and FACED datasets (32 channels, more subjects), EmT-B (4 layers) achieves better results, likely due to fewer channels and higher subject variability, where deeper models like EmT-D tend to overfit. Overall, EmT-B strikes a better balance between temporal and spatial learning in datasets with fewer channels and greater inter-subject variability.",

However, when using MSA as the token mixer in EmT, the performance reduced dramatically, falling below all compared baselines. The difference between MSA and RNNs or TCN is that RNNs or TCN can fuse the information globally or locally, while MSA focuses on learning the global temporal relations and emphasizing certain parts of the sequence.

When EmT was tested without the RMPG module, it exhibited the second-largest reduction in accuracy on both datasets, with decreases of 2.7% and 1.8%, respectively. Similarly, the removal of TCT and STA modules also resulted in noticeable reductions in classification accuracy and F1 scores. These findings highlight that all the proposed modules work synergistically to enhance the predictive capabilities of EmT.

We compared three types of features: PSD, DE, and rPSD, evaluating their effects on accuracy and F1 score for classification tasks, as well as on MRSE, CCC, and PCC for regression tasks. For classification tasks, rPSD outperformed the other two feature types, providing the highest accuracy and F1 score. Specifically, rPSD achieved 5.9% and 11.5% higher accuracy and F1 score, respectively, compared to EmT using DE. Furthermore, rPSD showed a 13.0% and 18.9% improvement in accuracy and F1 score, respectively, over PSD. These results suggest that rPSD is a superior spectral feature for EEG emotion classification tasks. For regression tasks, using rPSD resulted in better MRSE and CCC compared to using DE. However, the difference in PCC between rPSD and DE was minimal, with rPSD achieving a PCC of 0.491 and DE achieving a PCC of 0.490. Notably, when PSD was used as a feature, the model failed to converge, so we excluded these results from further analysis. Based on these findings, rPSD is demonstrated to be a more effective feature than DE, and both rPSD and DE are superior to PSD for EEG emotion recognition tasks.",

EmT-D and the SEED dataset were used for these experiments as they provide better overall performance compared to other configurations. The results are shown in Fig.  4 . Since the RMPG module has two GCN branches, we tested four different configurations of GCN layers:  [1, 1] ,  [1, 2] ,  [2, 2] , and  [2, 3] . These numbers represent the number of GCN layers (depth) for each branch in RMPG. As shown in Fig.  4  (a), the  [1, 2]  configuration yields the best performance. Compared to  [1, 1]  and  [2, 2] , the results highlight the effectiveness of the pyramid design. Additionally, increasing the number of GCN layers leads to a significant drop in classification performance, consistent with the oversmoothing issue in deeper GCNs  [37] . In contrast, the effects of width are relatively smaller, as shown in Fig.  4 (b) . There is a positive correlation between width and performance when increasing the width from 8 to 32. However, the performance declines when the width is increased further, likely due to over-fitting caused by the larger model size.",

Specifically, accuracy increases from 0.780 to 0.802, while the F1 score shows a more substantial rise from 0.759 to 0.821, with the most significant improvement occurring between 6 and 8 TCT blocks. This indicates that adding more TCT blocks enhances the model's ability to capture temporal contextual information, thereby improving classification performance. Conversely, for regression tasks, shown in Fig.  5  (b), the number of TCT blocks has little to no effect on the performance metrics. The RMSE remains stable around 0.06, and both the PCC and CCC show minimal variation, hovering around 0.48 and 0.39, respectively.

      "text": "1) The learned connections: Fig.  6  illustrates the learned connectivity of brain regions on SEED. Two learnable adjacency matrices reveal different connectivity patterns during the emotional cognitive process. Fig.  6  clearly shows a difference in the learned connectivities under emotion stimulation. In Fig.  6  (a), the strongest learned connections are F6-POz, P2-Fz, F7-O1, PO5-Pz, T8-P7, and FC4-FPz. These connections indicate relationships among the frontal, parietal, and temporal areas, which are known to be closely related to mental attention  [38] . In Fig.  6 (b) , the important connections learned by EmT are FC4-P7, FT8-C5, Cz-Fz, T8-CP4, CP6-FP2, F2-TP8, and O1-P2. These connections include interactions among the frontal, temporal, and parietal areas, which are known to be related to emotions  [39] ,  [40] ,  [41] . Additionally, some interactions involve the occipital and parietal areas, which are associated with visual processes. This is expected as videos were used as stimuli in the data collection experiments  [22] . The two distinct patterns in Fig.  6  reflect EmT's ability to capture multiple cognitive connectivities for the given classification task.\n\n2) The learned temporal contextual information: We visualized the hidden features before and after the TCT blocks to examine 1) the nature of temporal contextual information and 2) how TCT uses it for classification and regression tasks. For classification, we visualized the averaged features of samples The visualization results for the classification task are shown in Fig.  8 . Here, d represents the dimension of hidden features, and t denotes time. S T ∈ R seq×dg and S cls ∈ R seq×d head represent the learned features before and after the TCT blocks, respectively, with superscripts indicating class labels. As seen in Fig.  8 , the features change over time before the TCT-Clas blocks, particularly for class 0 (low valence stimuli). After the TCT blocks, the activations become more consistent, likely due to self-attention focusing on parts strongly correlated with the emotional state and the SAT layer smoothing fluctuations by aggregating nearby temporal information. For regression, the visualization (Fig.  9 ) also shows temporal changes in the feature space, indicating the presence of temporal contextual information. Unlike classification, the regression features are not simply smoothed. Instead, TCT-Regr, using RNNs as token mixers, combines evolving features across different dimensions, resulting in a more complex representation that is well-suited for continuous emotional state prediction. The RNN's ability to capture sequential dependencies allows it to focus on key changes necessary for continuous prediction.\n\nIn summary, the changes in features before the TCT blocks confirm the presence of temporal contextual information reflecting the dynamic nature of emotional states. The TCT blocks handle tasks differently: in classification, features are smoothed to enhance separability, while in regression, RNN token mixers preserve temporal variations, enabling continuous emotional predictions.",

RMPG is proposed to learn multiple connection patterns for different brain cognitive processes under emotional stimulation. TCT is designed to learn temporal contextual information from the temporal EEG graphs. Subject-independent classification and regression tasks are conducted to evaluate EmT and relevant baseline methods. Results on three bench-marking datasets demonstrate EmT shows improvements over the compared baselines. Our approach is inspired by neuropsychological knowledge and offers a new perspective for improving decoding performance by learning multiple cognition-related graph connections and capturing temporal contextual information. These improvements are supported by enhanced performance and visualizations of the learned connections and temporal features. Additionally, the visualization of the temporal features provides insights into how different token mixers function in classification and regression tasks.",
