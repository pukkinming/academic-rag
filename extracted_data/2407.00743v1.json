      "text": "Emotion Recognition in Conversations (ERC) is a popular task in natural language processing, which aims to recognize the emotional state of the speaker in conversations. While current research primarily emphasizes contextual modeling, there exists a dearth of investigation into effective multimodal fusion methods. We propose a novel framework called AIMDiT to solve the problem of multimodal fusion of deep features. Specifically, we design a Modality Augmentation Network which performs rich representation learning through dimension transformation of different modalities and parameter-efficient inception block. On the other hand, the Modality Interaction Network performs interaction fusion of extracted inter-modal features and intra-modal features. Experiments conducted using our AIMDiT framework on the public benchmark dataset MELD reveal 2.34% and 2.87% improvements in terms of the Acc-7 and w-F1 metrics compared to the state-of-the-art (SOTA) models.",

      "text": "Emotion recognition in conversations (ERC) is a novel task within the realm of natural language processing, holding a pivotal role in human-computer interaction  [1]  and social media analysis  [2] . There is an increasing focus on multimodal ERC, which involves leveraging text, audio, and visual information to achieve more accurate emotion recognition.\n\nMultimodal data tends to be asynchronous, with distributional gaps in text, audio, and visual modal data, which tends to introduce information redundancy  [3, 4] . In ERC, most of the work focuses on context modeling based on sequence models or graph models and often ignores the work on multimodal fusion  [5] [6] [7] . Although these early works can realize multimodal data fusion by simple early-late fusion  [8] [9] [10] [11] , they cannot extract the inter-modal interaction information and the simple concatenation operation makes it easy to introduce redundant information. In recent years, some ERC works based on multimodal fusion of depth graphs have been proposed  [12] , but due to the characteristics of depth graphs, redundant information gradually accumulates in the vector space of each layer and is prone to over-smoothing problem that makes node differentiation insufficient  [13] .\n\nWe have observed subtle distinctions in the distribution of text, audio, and visual information in emotional expressions, but they tend to be concentrated over a brief time span. For the purpose of discussion, we standardize the embedding dimensions of various modalities, treating vector length as the temporal dimension. Consequently, modal vectors can be conceptualized as 1D time series. Drawing inspiration from  [14] [15] [16] , we refer to changes in adjacent time intervals within a single modality and the same time interval across different modalities as intra-modal variation and inter-modal variation, respectively. To represent these characteristics, we transform 1D vectors into 2D, where the length axis signifies intra-modal information and the dimensional axis signifies inter-modal information. As a result, we successfully incorporate intra-and inter-modal features into 2D tensors.\n\nBased on the above motivation, we propose the Modality Augmentation and Interaction Network via Dimension Transformation (AIMDiT). We first design the Modality Augmentation Network (MAN) based on dimension change and convolution by Inception. Specifically, the MAN consists of multiple layers of MABlock with residual links, which captures intra-and inter-modal information in 2D space. In order to perform an effective fusion of modalities, inspired by  [17] , we propose the Interaction Network (MIN) where inter-modal feature and intra-modal feature guide the fusion of each other. Finally, emotion classifier predicts the emotion label.",

      "text": "The proposed model AIMDiT in this paper is shown in Fig.  1 . A primary utterance involves three modalities: U t (text), U a (audio), and U v (visual). Initially, we extract features from these modalities, yielding X t ,X a ,X v . To capture inter-and intra-modal features, we devise the Modality Augmentation Network, elevating X t , X a , X v to higher dimensions for richer information. Following this, the Modality Interaction Network interacts with the MAN's output, guided by a specific direction. This leads to subsequent emotion classification. Further details are outlined below.",

      "text": "For the same modality, each time point involves both adjacent regions inside a modality and in-phase changes between different modalities, that is, changes within modalities and changes between modals. To capture both features at the same time, we build a module Modality Augmentation Block (MABlock), which explores rich information between different modalitys through dimensional changes. Specifically, ignoring the dimension d, we consider t, a and v, where each modal corresponds to having 1D sequences\n\nand with lengths T t , T a , T v , respectively. We can then convert the three tensors into a 2D tensor by using the following formula:\n\nwhere P adding(•) is the process of padding each of the three tensors into a new tensor of uniform length, and use the length of the longest tensor of the three as the length of the new tensor T δ = max(T t , T a , T v ). Eventually we obtain a 2D tensor X t,a,v 2D . After the transformation, we process the 2D tensor by inception block with multiple 2D kernels of different scales to obtain a 2D tensor X t,a,v 2D with global information:\n\nSince the 2D kernel of the inception block is multiscale, it can capture information at adjacent time points within each modality and at the same time point for different modalities, and is able to aggregate intra-and inter-modal variations at different scales. Subsequently, we reconvert the learned X t,a,v 2D tensor into 1D space, and truncate the three tensors with length T δ back to their original lengths:\n\nAs shown in Fig.  1 , we connect the Modality Augmentation Block (MABlock) with residuals to form a MAN in order to prevent the problem of gradient vanishing in deep networks and to improve the expressive power of the network. Specifically, given three X t 1D , X a 1D , and X v 1D with lengths T t , T a , T v , respectively, which are represented by a one-dimensional tensor\n\n} with length T δ , and for the kth-layer MAN, the inputs are X k-1 1D , and its computation procedure is represented by Equation  4 :\n\nAccording to Eqs. 1, 2, and 3 the whole process of the kth MAB can be summarized as follows:\n\nAfter the processing of the k-layer MAB, we get three modal outputs\n\n, and finally we need to fuse these three outputs, where we use the average fusion. Through the above operation, we can extract to the intermodal Feature X\n\nIn order to capture the intra-modal feature X p α within the modality α as well as to maintain the consistency of the MAN structure, we take the text, audio and visual feature inputs as the inputs to the MAN respectively, i.e., three MANs are used to process each of the three modalities, which are denoted by\n\n), α = {t, a, v}.",

We apply the cross-modal attention proposed by  [17] . The main idea is to use modality β to reconstruct modality α, so as to achieve the fusion of the two modalities. Specifically, the modal β tensor X β passes through as the inputs of K and V in the attention, and the modal α as the input of Q. Then, the cross-modal attention Y α is defined as follows:\n\nBased on Cross-modal Attention, we constitute Crossmodal Transformer by stacking this structure. CMT consists of k layers of Cross-modal Transformer, which takes the outputs X i-1 β→α and X β of the previous layer as inputs, and the outputs are the enhanced features X i β→α :\n\nwhere β ∈ {t, a, v}, X i β→α ∈ R T δ ×d . In addition, in order to fuse the inter-modal and intra-modal information, we also performed the traditional self-attention based Selfmodal Transformer processing for each modality, and finally averaged the two to obtain a comprehensive representation of each modality. It is expressed as follows:\n\nwhere Y c α is the output obtained by CMT using the intermodal feature X c and the intra-modal feature of the modal α. Y p α is the output obtained by SMT for the modal α, where α ∈ {t, a, v}.",

Interestingly, the overall results are best when the MAN has 2 layers. However, increasing to 3 layers significantly reduces the effect.
