      "text": "Speech emotion recognition (SER) is an important research topic in human-computer interaction. Existing works mainly rely on human expertise to design models. Despite their success, different datasets often require distinct structures and hyperparameters. Searching for an optimal model for each dataset is time-consuming and labor-intensive. To address this problem, we propose a two-stream neural architecture search (NAS) based framework, called \"EmotionNAS\". Specifically, we take two-stream features (i.e., handcrafted and deep features) as the inputs, followed by NAS to search for the optimal structure for each stream. Furthermore, we incorporate complementary information in different streams through an efficient information supplement module. Experimental results demonstrate that our method outperforms existing manually-designed and NASbased models, setting the new state-of-the-art record.",

      "text": "Speech emotion recognition (SER) has received increasing attention due to its contribution to human-computer interactions  [1, 2, 3] . SER aims to understand how humans express their emotions and then classify each utterance into its emotional state  [4, 5] . Existing works are mainly manually-designed models  [6, 7, 8, 9] . Despite their success, these works rely on historical experience to design model structures, which is often time-consuming and labor-intensive  [10, 11] . Therefore, how to design networks more intelligently has been brought into focus. To this end, we explore neural architecture search (NAS) for SER  [12, 13] . By setting the search space, the search strategy, and the evaluation metric, we can optimize the model architecture automatically with little human intervention.\n\nPreviously, search methods based on reinforcement learning  [14]  or evolutionary algorithms  [15]  avoided the exhaustive search and provided deep learning-inspired design principles. However, these methods need the retraining process every time a new substructure is sampled, which consumes numerous computational resources. To speed up the search process, researchers propose differentiable architecture search (DARTS)  [10, 16, 17, 18] , which relaxes the search space to be continuous by applying a softmax operation. Additionally, some efforts  [19, 20]  build a model library by pre-training multiple structures. These methods successfully alleviate the time-consuming process in previous works. In this paper, we rely on more efficient search methods to design SER models.",

      "text": "In addition to model design, another challenge in SER is how to represent audios  [21] . Among existing handcrafted features, spectrograms are widely utilized in SER  [22, 23, ?, 24] . However, the spectrogram loses some phase information during calculation. Recently, the deep feature, wav2vec  [25] , has demonstrated its effectiveness in speech representation learning  [26] . It is a self-supervised framework that can learn powerful acoustic representations with the help of large amounts of unlabeled data. However, wav2vec may lose some emotionrelated information due to different training objectives. To obtain a more comprehensive speech representation, we integrate handcrafted and deep features via a two-stream framework.\n\nMeanwhile, how to fuse multiple features also affects the classification performance. Unsuitable fusion approaches cannot effectively utilize the complementary information in different features, which may lead to performance degradation compared to the best-performing feature (denoted as the dominant feature in this paper). Therefore, we further design an effective fusion method, called \"information supply module (ISM)\", to ensure that the performance of the dominant feature is not degraded and can be further improved.\n\nIn summary, to address the low efficiency of the manuallydesigned approach and inefficient fusion of different features, we propose a novel two-stream framework called \"Emotion-NAS\". Figure  1  shows the overall structure of our proposed method. Experimental results show that EmotionNAS outperforms existing manually-designed and NAS-based models. The contributions of this paper can be summarized as follows:\n\n• We propose a novel framework called \"EmotionNAS\". It incorporates complementary information in handcrafted and deep features, followed by NAS to efficiently search through numerous possible networks to find the optimal structure. • We further design ISM to effectively fuse complementary information in different features. • Experimental results on IEMOCAP show that our method successfully outperforms existing manually-designed and NAS-based models, setting the new state-of-the-art record.",
