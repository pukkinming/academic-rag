      "text": "Multimodal sentiment analysis is a fundamental problem in the field of affective computing. Although significant progress has been made in cross-modal interaction, it remains a challenge due to the insufficient reference context in cross-modal interactions. Current cross-modal approaches primarily focus on leveraging modality-level reference context within a individual sample for cross-modal feature enhancement, neglecting the potential cross-sample relationships that can serve as sample-level reference context to enhance the cross-modal features. To address this issue, we propose a novel multimodal retrieval-augmented framework to simultaneously incorporate inter-sample modalitylevel reference context and cross-sample sample-level reference context to enhance the multimodal features. In particular, we first design a contrastive cross-modal retrieval module to retrieve semantic similar samples and enhance target modality. To endow the model to capture both inter-sample and intrasample information, we integrate two different types of prompts, modality-level prompts and sample-level prompts, to generate modality-level and sample-level reference contexts, respectively. Finally, we design a cross-modal retrieval-augmented encoder that simultaneously leverages modality-level and sample-level reference contexts to enhance the target modality. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness and superiority of our model on two publicly available datasets.",

      "text": "M Ultimodal content, primarily consisting of text, visual, and acoustic, is widely present in our daily lives. It is crucial for computers to analyze and understand these multimodal data. Multimodal sentiment analysis is an important and fundamental problem in the field of affective computing, which has attracted significant attention from researchers and made substantial progress. Previous multimodal sentiment analysis studies can be broadly divided into two categories: multimodal interaction learning methods and multimodal representation learning methods. The former learns enhanced multimodal features through cross-modal interaction learning  [1] -  [5] , while the latter learns fine-grained representations by Fig.  1 . Previous cross-modal interaction paradigm that solely rely on modality-level reference context to enhance target modality produce erroneous sentiment polarity. In contrast, our method simultaneously utilizes both modality-level and sample-level reference contexts to enhance target modality, resulting in the correct sentiment polarity. modeling the geometric relationships in the cross-modal representation space  [6] -  [11] . These approach effectively addresses key limitations of multimodal interaction learning, such as the alignment and fusion of cross-modal information.\n\nDespite achieving significant progress, these methods still suffer from important drawbacks. These approaches learn enhanced multimodal features that are limited to the information within individual sample, overlooking the rich reference context information provided by similar samples. The reference context offered by similar samples can provide more richer information for multimodal feature enhancement compared to intra-sample multimodal interaction learning  [12] -  [16] . As illustrated in Figure  1 , the multimodal sentiment analysis model that only considers modality-level reference context within the individual sample generates incorrect sentiment polarity. By additionally incorporating sample-level reference context of intra-samples, the multimodal sentiment analysis model produces the correct sentiment polarity. Therefore, it would be interesting to investigate i) how to introduce cross-sample reference context into multimodal interaction learning, ii) how to efficiently facilitate the integration of inter-sample and intra-sample reference contexts to learn enhanced multimodal features.\n\nTo tackle these downsides, we propose a novel Towards Multimodal Sentiment Analysis via Contrastive Cross-modal Retrieval Augmentation and Hierarchical Prompts, namely TC 2 RAHP, which is the first unified multimodal sentiment analysis framework that can introduce and incorporate modality-level and sample-level reference context to enhance target modality. As shown in Figure  2 , we first design a contrastive cross-modal retrieval module to learn the reference context of similar samples. This module learns positive and negative samples similar to the target modality under the guidance of positive and negative sentiment semantics. We leverage contrastive learning to constrain the model to learn samples that are semantically similar to the target modality, rather than just feature-wise similarity. Positive samples are selected as sample-level reference contexts to enhance the target modality. To facilitate inter-sample and intra-sample interaction learning, we design a prompt-based cross-modal reference context generation module. This module includes two different types of prompts, modality-level prompts and sample-level prompts, which map cross-modal and crosssample information into modality-level and sample-level reference context. We design a cross-modal retrieval-enhanced encoder that leverages modality-level and sample-level reference contexts to enhance the target modality and improve its representational ability, thereby increasing the accuracy of sentiment polarity prediction. Extensive experiments on two publicly available multimodal datasets, CMU-MOSI and CMU-MOSEI, validate the effectiveness and superiority of our model. The main contributions of this work are threefold:\n\n• We introduce a cross-modal retrieval-augmented interaction framework for multimodal sentiment analysis, which is capable of learning cross-modal and cross-sample information to enhance the target modality. • We design a contrastive cross-modal retrieval module that retrieves positive and negative samples relative to the target modality and strengthens the semantics of these samples.\n\n• We design a prompt-based cross-modal reference context generation module that maps inter-sample and intrasample information into modality-level and sample-level reference contexts. Additionally, we customize a crossmodal retrieval-augmented encoder that utilizes these reference contexts to enhance the target modality.",

Current research focuses primarily on two aspects: multimodal representation learning and multimodal fusion.\n\nThe former continuously explores semantics  [19] ,  [20]  through feature transformation to obtain more fine-grained feature representations. Zadeh et al.  [21]  further explored the local information of the features by reshaping and concatenating the tensors, as well as establishing associations between the different tensors. Liu et al.  [22]  deconstructed the matrix to transform it into a low-rank matrix, capturing feature information in the altered vector space. Yang et al.  [7]  decomposed the features into fine-grained shared and private features through adversarial methods, capturing information along these two dimensions. Yu et al.  [6]  synthesized global information to generate sentiment labels, which then guided further feature extraction. The latter projects multiple nonaligned local features into the same feature space through interactions between different modalities and obtains global sentiment information within this feature space  [23] . Tsai et al.  [1]  first projected multiple local features into the same vector space through cross-modal attention and then integrated global sentiment information through self-attention. Han et al.  [17]  designed a hierarchical structure to layerwise integrate information from various modalities, as well as to fuse information across modalities and within individual modalities, for sentiment analysis. Yu et al.  [24]  assigned modality-specific information to each modality to guide the extraction of features and the fusion of global information. Zhang et al.  [25]  identified the modules with weak information extraction capabilities and prioritized training these modules through targeted prompts. Li et al.  [26]  noticed the noise caused by modal imbalance and mitigated it by adjusting the distance between modalities in the semantic space to perform feature denoising.\n\nWith the development of LLMs and MLLMs  [27] , many studies have begun to explore the application of LLMs and MLLMs in multimodal sentiment analysis tasks  [28] ,  [29] , demonstrating superior zero-shot performance. LLMs such as ChatGPT  [30]  and LLama  [31]  have shown excellent sentiment analysis results by capturing richer feature representations in text. MLLMs such as Gemini-V  [32]  and BLIP-2  [33]  possess stronger cross-modal interaction capabilities, allowing better utilization of information from different modalities.",

The workflow of the proposed model is as follows: Given the i-th video clip, we use the pre-trained models to extract text  [40] , visual  [41] , and acoustic  [42]  features, denoted as x {t,v,a} i ∈ D, respectively. D denotes the whole dataset. We obtain the feature set {x {t,v,a} j } ∈ D, i ̸ = j as the reference pool. Under the guidance of sentiment labels, we retrieve the most similar positive and negative samples relative to the target modality x t i from the reference pool, denoted as {x t nt , x t pt }, {x t nv , x t pv } and {x t na , x t pa }. We use contrastive loss L ccrl to constrain the target modality and the retrieved samples. In the prompt-based cross-modal generation network, modality-level prompts P mt and intra-sample features x {t,v,a} i are input into the modality generation network f θm * to obtain modality-level reference context x tm i . Sample-level prompt P st and intersample features x t p {t,v,a} are input into the sample generation network f θs * to obtain sample-level reference context x ts i . The modality-level and sample-level reference context information x tm i and x ts i are respectively input into the cross-modal retrieval-augmented encoder to enhance the target modality x t i , thereby obtaining the enhanced features xtm i and xts i .

      "text": "Previous multimodal sentiment analysis methods  [1] ,  [25] ,  [26]  primarily explore intra-sample multimodal interaction learning to enhance the features of the target modality, neglecting the reference information provided by external samples. To this end, we propose a contrastive cross-modal retrieval module that selects reference samples from external samples and provides richer reference context for feature enhancement of the target modality. This module is capable of effectively retrieving valid reference samples from external samples and optimizing the semantic of these reference samples with the guidance of sentiment category. Specifically, given a mini-batch containing M ∈ D samples as reference pool {x {t,v,a} j } ∈ M, we use cosine similarity as the similarity measure to retrieve the samples with the highest feature similarity. The samples with matching sentiment labels to the target modality m α ∈ {t, v, a} are selected as positive samples x {t,v,a} pm β , m β ∈ {t, v, a}, while those with opposing sentiment labels to the target modality are selected as negative samples x {t,v,a} nm β , m β ∈ {t, v, a}. The cross-modal retrieval similarity is calculated as follows:\n\nwhere x mα i and x m β j represent the features of the target modality and the reference sample, respectively. F represents the cosine similarity function. The y i and y j represent the sentiment label of samples i and j at training stage, respectively. Note that, during the testing phase, the model is already able to effectively distinguish the semantics of positive and negative samples, so label guidance is not required. We can retrieve the corresponding positive and negative reference sample pairs {x mα pm β , x mα nm β } for each modality according to the Eq. 2. Formally,\n\nwhere the superscript m α represents the target modality, the subscript m β represents the retrieved modality, and p and n denote positive and negative samples, respectively. For example, x t pv represents the most similar visual modality retrieved from external positive samples with the text modality as the target modality. Only leveraging the similarity between the target modality and external samples makes it difficult to learn semantic associations, as the target modality may have high similarity with external samples that possess opposite sentiment polarities. We design a contrastive loss to reduce the distance between the target modality and the positive reference sample features, while increasing the distance between the target modality and the negative reference sample features. The contrastive cross-modal retrieval loss is formulated as follows:\n\n(5) where m α , m β ∈ {t, a, v} denotes modality, d represents the l 2 norm constraint between the two feature spaces, and γ denotes the upper bound of the distance metric between the target modality and the negative reference sample. The contrastive constraint ensures that the retrieved samples are not only feature-wise similar, but more importantly, semantically similar in terms of sentiment.",

      "text": "Multimodal data often exhibits gaps in feature space distributions  [24] ,  [43] . Previous methods address this issue by designing bridging neural networks to perform modality-tomodality mapping  [8] . Specifically, in scenarios with missing modality  [44] , these methods use prompts to bridge the gap and generate the missing modality, as prompts can learn crossmodal mapping information. Based on this observation, we propose using prompts to transform cross-modal reference samples into representations of the target modality's reference context. Modality-level prompts and sample-level prompts are used for generating modality-level and sample-level reference contexts, respectively. We refer to these prompts as hierarchical prompts, which can be formalized as: P m = {P mt , P mv , P ma } (6) P s = {P st , P sv , P sa }  (7)  where P m and P s represent modality-level and sample-level prompts, respectively. The initialization  [45]  form of the prompt is as follows:\n\nwhere f an in represents the number of input neurons, which is the feature dimension of the prompt. The symbol a represents the negative slope parameter with a value of 5, and b is a constant with a value of 6. The symbol U represents the uniform distribution, indicating that weights are sampled symmetrically within the interval. We inject prompt P m and P s into functions f θm (•) and f θs (•) with parameters θ m and θ s , respectively, to transform the reference samples into the corresponding modality-level reference context. This can be formalized as:\n\nx as = f θs tva→a ([P sa , f θs t→a (x a pt ), f θs v→a (x a pv ), f θs a→a (x a pa )])\n\nwhere x ts , x vs and x as represent the sample-level reference context, which is used to enhance the features of the target modality. The x t p {t,v,a} , x v p {t,v,a} , and x a p {t,v,a} represents the positive reference samples retrieved from external samples, as defined in Eq. 3 of Section III-B. Similarly, we also transform the intra-sample reference modality into the samplelevel reference context to enhance the features of the target modality. Formally, this can be represented as:\n\n) where x tm , x vm , and x am are the modality-level reference contexts used to enhance the features of the target modality. The x t , x v , and x a represent the multimodal features of individual intra-sample that need to be enhanced target modalities, respectively. Since both intra-sample and inter-sample multimodal information need to be transformed into reference contexts to enhance the target modality, the prompt-based transformation function effectively facilitates the conversion of cross-modal information.",

The CMU-MOSI dataset serves as a widely recognized benchmark for sentiment analysis across multiple modalities, including acoustic, text, and visual. It consists of 2,199 YouTube video clips, each of which has been manually labeled with a sentiment intensity rating on a scale from -3 (indicating extreme negativity) to +3 (indicating extreme positivity).\n\nCMU-MOSEI  [48] . CMU-MOSEI is a sentiment analysis dataset collected from YouTube. As an extension of CMU-MOSI, CMU-MOSEI shares a similar annotation standard for sentiment scores and encompasses a more diverse range of video categories, comprising a total of 22,856 video segments.\n\nB. Experimental Settings a) Evaluation Protocols.: Following previous work, we employed four evaluation metrics to assess the model's performance: Binary Classification Accuracy (Acc2), F1-Score, Mean Absolute Error (MAE), and Pearson Correlation (Corr). Specifically, we converted the regression predictions into binary values for computing Acc-2. Higher values indicate better performance for all metrics except MAE.\n\nb) Implementation Details.: We trained our proposed model using the PyTorch library on a single NVIDIA A100 GPU. The AdamW optimizer is configured with a batch size of 8. For training on the CMU-MOSI dataset, the number of epochs was set to 50, while for the CMU-MOSEI dataset, it was set to 20. The learning rate was fixed at 1e-5. The upper bound of the distance metric γ was set to 50.\n\nC. Baselines a) MSA Models.: We compared our proposed model with state-of-the-art baseline models in the task of multimodal sentiment analysis to justify its effectiveness. TFN  [21]  expands at the tensor level to capture both intra-modal and inter-modal information. LMF  [22]  decomposes the model weights into low-rank factors for tensor fusion. MULT  [1]  leverages crossmodal attention to incorporate information from other modalities into the current modality. MISA  [43]  divides the modality features into more fine-grained shared and exclusive features. Self-MM  [6]  generates labels through a self-supervised approach and further employs them to facilitate the interaction of multimodal information. MMIM  [17]  captures sentiment information through multidimensional interactions between modalities. FDMER  [7]  optimizes the parameters of the encoders for identifying private and shared features through adversarial learning. AMML  [49]  integrates the information learned from single-modal tasks into the multimodal context. ConKI  [24]  incorporates modality-specific information for each modality. HyDiscGAN  [50]  aligns different modalities and generates simulated multimodal features from the obtained information to achieve privacy protection. MOFN  [51]  proposes an alignment method that enriches the representation of video frame features to achieve video restoration. DMD  [9]  addresses the modality imbalance issue using a crossmodal distillation method. ConFEDE  [10]  decomposes the features and enhances the information representation through contrastive learning. DTN  [11]  decouples the features of a single modality and explores the commonality and diversity between different modalities.\n\nb) LLMs and MLLMs.: We selected several highperforming large language models from the benchmark tests  [52]  of multimodal large language models as baselines, such as Chatgpt  [30] , LLama2  [31] , Flan-T5  [53] , Qwen-VLs  [54] , BLIP-2  [33] , InstructBLIP  [55] , GPT-4V  [56] , Claude3-V  [57] , and Gemini-V  [32] .",

Specifically, this compensation module aligns video frames, which are subsequently processed by a fusion module for reconstruction, thus obtaining frames of improved visual quality. This result indicates that fully leveraging the modality-level reference context is essential in sentiment analysis. 2) Among LLM and MLLM based methods, GPT-4V and Gemini-V outperforms the compared baselines. Compared with MOFN, GPT-4V and Gemini-V obtains relative Acc2 gains with 4.02% and 0.82%, respectively. This result indicates that LLMs possess representational capabilities that traditional sentiment analysis models cannot surpass.\n\nOur proposed model outperforms all baseline models across all evaluation metrics on both the CMU-MOSI and CMU-MOSEI datasets. Compared with GPT-4V and Gemini-V, our proposed model obtains relative Acc2 gains with 0.4% and 0.44%, respectively. The reason is that our model not only focuses on the sample-level reference context but also incorporates the modality-level reference context. This indicates that simultaneously attending to both sample-level and modality-level reference contexts, and performing fine-grained interactions, can further enhance the model's capability.\n\nBeyond comparing the results under Acc-2, we also report performance under the Acc-7 metric, as shown in Figures  3  and 4 . The experimental results demonstrate that our model consistently outperforms all open-source large models and most closed-source models in terms of Acc-7.

To this end, we visualized the process of retrieving positive and negative samples for the target modality during the training phase.\n\nBut none of those things matter its a fun movie anyway.\n\nAnd um fun at the end.\n\nThe first one was a lot better.\n\nTarget sample: And um fun at the end.\n\nThe first one was a lot better. Specifically, we selected specific samples, using the text modality as an example, and visualized the changes in the retrieved positive and negative samples as the training steps increased, along with the corresponding similarity values. The results are displayed in Figure  5 . From Figure  5 , we gained the following observations. 1) In the initial stage, the similarity of positive and negative samples relative to the target modality is similar, but their semantic information is opposite. 2) As the training steps increase, the similarity of positive samples to the target modality increases, while the similarity of negative samples to the target modality decreases.\n\n3) The retrieved positive and negative samples are dynamically changing. This result indicates that relying solely on similarity-based retrieval may lead to samples with opposite semantics, which could negatively impact the model. After adding the contrastive cross-modal retrieval constraint, the similarity of samples with opposing semantics to the target modality is significantly reduced. This strongly demonstrates the effectiveness of the contrastive cross-modal retrieval module.\n\nTo gain deeper insights into the contrastive cross-modal retrieval module, we explained the changes in the similarity of specific target modality and the retrieved positive and negative samples as the training steps increase, as shown in Figure  6 . We could observe that the similarity between the target modality and the fixed retrieved positive samples increases, while the similarity with the negative samples exhibits an opposite trend. This result further confirms the effectiveness of the contrastive cross-modal retrieval module. This result further demonstrates the effectiveness of the contrastive crossmodal retrieval module, as it ensures that the model retrieves samples that are similar to the target modality both in terms of features and semantics, thereby enhancing the model's performance.

From Figure  8 , we could observe that the model's performance increases initially with the length of the prompt, then slightly decreases. The unit prompt contribution rate is decreasing. The model achieves the best performance when the prompt length is 128. This may be due to the fact that as the prompt length increases, the model gradually learns more information from both modalitylevel and sample-level reference contexts. The shorter prompt length fails to carry enough reference context information, while the longer prompt length causes the model to focus on trivial details, leading to a decline in performance. This result proves the effectiveness of modality-level and samplelevel prompts, as well as the fact that an appropriate prompt length can enhance model performance.",

Based on these experimental results, we could observe that solely utilizing sample-level reference context to enhance the modality may lead to inaccurate or even incorrect sentiment polarity. The additional incorporation of sample-level reference context guides the model to output the correct sentiment polarity. This qualitative experimental result highlights the necessity and effectiveness of introducing sample-level reference context.",

Specifically, we first design a cross-modal contrastive retrieval module that retrieves samples semantically similar to the target modality. We then introduce modality-level and sample-level prompts, leveraging inter-sample and intra-sample information to generate modality-level and sample-level reference contexts, respectively. Finally, we design a cross-modal retrievalenhanced encoder that utilizes modality-level and sample-level reference contexts to enhance the target modality, improving its representational capacity. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness and superiority of the proposed model.",
