      "text": "The audio-video based multimodal emotion recognition has attracted a lot of attention due to its robust performance. Most of the existing methods focus on proposing different cross-modal fusion strategies. However, these strategies introduce redundancy in the features of different modalities without fully considering the complementary properties between modal information, and these approaches do not guarantee the non-loss of original semantic information during intra-and inter-modal interactions. In this paper, we propose a novel cross-modal fusion network based on self-attention and residual structure (CFN-SR) for multimodal emotion recognition. Firstly, we perform representation learning for audio and video modalities to obtain the semantic features of the two modalities by efficient ResNeXt and 1D CNN, respectively. Secondly, we feed the features of the two modalities into the cross-modal blocks separately to ensure efficient complementarity and completeness of information through the self-attention mechanism and residual structure. Finally, we obtain the output of emotions by splicing the obtained fused representation with the original representation. To verify the effectiveness of the proposed method, we conduct experiments on the RAVDESS dataset. The experimental results show that the proposed CFN-SR achieves the state-of-the-art and obtains 75.76% accuracy with 26.30M parameters.

      "text": "Multimodal emotion recognition has attracted a lot of attention due to its high performance and robustness  [1] , which is applied in various fields such as human-computer interaction and social robotics  [2] . The main goal of multimodal emotion recognition is to obtain human emotion expressions from a video sequence. Humans express their emotions mainly through multiple modalities such as speech  [3] , body gestures  [4] , facial expressions  [5] , and text  [6] . Although many studies have employed more complex modalities, video and audio are still the primary modalities used for this task due to their ability to adequately convey emotion. Therefore, in this work, we focus on the audio-video based multimodal emotion recognition.\n\nAmong the existing researches, multimodal emotion recognition can be classified according to the modal information fusion method: early fusion  [7] , late fusion  [8, 9]  and model fusion  [10, 11] . Early * Corresponding author. fusion is to extract and construct multiple modal data into corresponding modal features before stitching them together into a feature set that integrates each modal feature. Late fusion is to find out the plausibility of each model, and then to coordinate and make joint decisions. Recently, with the development of Transformer  [12]  for natural language processing and computer vision tasks, model fusion is often done using Transformer for cross-modal interactions, with significant performance improvements due to the flexibility of fusion locations. For audio-video emotion recognition,  [13]  introduced Transformer to fuse audio and video representations. Different cross-modal fusion strategies were explored by  [14] .  [10]  proposed a novel representation fusion method, Capsule Graph Convolutional Network(CapsGCN), to use graph capsule networks for audio and video emotion recognition.\n\nHowever, existing methods ignore the complementary information between different modalities, and the final decision often requires the joint decision of the two modality-specific features as well as the fused features. The complementary information ensures that there is an improvement in performance when the fusion module is added. In addition, there is still a significant amount of redundancy in the way existing methods fuse. Some models are only stitched together for the final result output, and the stitched result will have many duplicate representations, and the feature information needs to be filtered to further reduce the redundant features before stitching. Moreover, the existing methods cannot guarantee the information integrity in the feature learning process, and often the learning of intraand inter-modal information will lose some semantic information.\n\nTo solve the above problems, we propose a novel cross-modal fusion network based on self-attention and residual structure (CFN-SR) for multimodal emotion recognition. Specifically, we first perform representation learning for audio modality and video modality. The spatio-temporal structure features of video frame sequences are obtained by ResNeXt  [15] . The MFCC features of audio sequences are obtained by a simple and effective 1D CNN. Secondly, we feed the features into the cross-modal blocks separately, and make the audio modality perform intra-modal feature selection through a selfattention mechanism, which will enable the selected features to interact with the video modality adaptively and efficiently between modalities. The integrity of the original structural features of the video modality can be ensured by the residual structure. Finally, we obtain the output of emotions by splicing the obtained fused representation and the original representation.We apply the model to the RAVDESS  [16]  multimodal emotion recognition dataset, and the experimental results demonstrate that our proposed CFN-SR is more effective, and our method achieves state-of-the-art compared with other models, obtaining an accuracy of 75.76% with a parametric number of 26.30M.",

We first pass the features through a 2-layer convolution operation to extract the local features of adjacent audio elements.

The specific equation is as follows:\n\nwhere BN stands for Batch Normalization, kA is the size of the convolution kernel of modality audio and XA denotes the learned semantic features.

We consider both the performance and training efficiency of the network and choose the 3D ResNeXt  [15]  network to obtain the spatio-temporal structural features of video modalities. ResNeXt proposes a group convolution strategy between the deep segmentation convolution of ordinary convolutional kernels, and achieves a balance between the two strategies by controlling the number of groups with a simple structure but powerful performance. We use feature preprocessed audio modal features as input, denoted as XV . We obtain the higher-order semantic features of video modalities by this network:\n\nwhere XV denotes the learned semantic features, C, S, H and W are the number of channels, sequence length, height, and width, respectively. After obtaining the higher-order semantic features, we feed them into the cross-modal blocks and fuse the audio feature representations. We believe that the final fused representation obtained contains not only the higher-order semantic features of the video modality, but also the interactive features of the two modalities.

      "text": "Through encoding operations for both modalities, we obtain higherorder semantic features for both audio and video modalities. To be able to make the final decision more accurate, we exploit the complementary intra-and inter-modal interaction information between the two modalities. Specifically, we first make the audio modality undergo intramodal representation learning through a self-attention mechanism. This operation allows adaptive learning of higher-order semantic features of the audio modality, making it more focused on features that have a greater impact on the outcome weights. Following Transformer  [12] , we use self-attention to perform feature selection on audio features. The self-attention mechanism is able to reflect the influence of feature neighboring elements, whose query, key, and value are all representations of the same audio modality under different projection spaces. The specific formula is as follows:\n\nwhere\n\nis represented by different projection spaces with different parameter matrices, where i represents the number of layers of transformer attention, i = 1, ..., D.\n\nWe feed the learned weight information into the full connection to obtain the feature adaptive learning results:\n\nwhere LN represents layer normalization, d f represents dimensions of the extracted features. This operation enables the higher-order features of the audio modality to perform feature selection, making it more focused on features that a greater impact on the outcome. Then, we make the automatically selected features and the video modality perform efficient inter-modal interactions. The module accepts input for two modalities, which is called XA ∈ R d f and XV ∈ R C×S×H×W . We obtain the mapping representations of the features for the two modalities by a linear projection. And then we process the two representations by add and tanh activation function. Finally, the fused representation Xo ∈ R C×S×H×W is obtained through sof tmax. We believe that the final fused information contains not only the complementary information of the two modalities, but also the features of the video modality. The specific formula is as follows:\n\nin which Wv ∈ R k×C and Wa ∈ R k×d f are linear transformation weights, and bv ∈ R k is the bias, where k is a pre-defined hyperparameter, and ⊕ represents the broadcast addition operation of a tensor and a vector. This operation enables high-level features to learn complementarily with low-level features, which complement the semantic features of low-level features and express richer information. In this process, to ensure that the information of the video modality is not lost, we ensure the integrity of the original structural features of the video modality through the residual structure.",

Data augmentation is performed using random cropping, level flipping and normalization methods. For the audio modality, since the first 0.5 seconds usually do not contain sound, we trim the first 0.5 seconds and keep it consistent for the next 2.45 seconds. Following the suggestion of  [19] , we extract the first 13 MFCC features for each cropped audio clip. We perform 5-fold cross-validation on the RAVDESS dataset to provide more robust results. We divide the 24 actors into a training and a test set in a 5:1 ratio. Since the actors' gender is represented by an even or odd number of actor IDs, we enable gender to be evenly distributed by rotating 4 consecutive actor IDs as the test set for each fold of cross-validation. The model is trained using the Adam optimizer  [20]  with a learning rate of 0.001, and the entire training of the model is done on a single NVIDIA RTX 8000.

Compared to the unimodal baseline, our network accuracy exceeds more than 10%, verifying the importance of multimodal fusion. In addition, the incorporation of the cross-modal fusion block only introduces a 30K number of parameters, but brings a significant performance improvement. Compared with early fusion methods, our method has more than 4% accuracy improvement, which shows that finding the association between video and audio modalities is a difficult task in the early stage. What's more, our proposed CFN-SR has 2.64% improvement over MMTM  [24]  and 0.9% improvement over the best-performing MSFA  [25] , and both have comparable number of parameters.

      "text": "Table  2  shows the ablation experiments on the RAVDESS dataset.\n\nTo verify the effectiveness of the cross-modal blocks, we obtain the final sentiment by simply splicing the high-level semantic features of the two modalities. The experimental results show that our crossmodal block leads to a performance improvement of more than 2% with only a 0.4M increase in the number of parameters, which indicates that efficient complementary information from both modalities can have a large impact on the final decision. Meanwhile, we observe that the output of the results by simple splicing will also be better than the early fusion method, which indicates that the early fusion method cannot adequately express the high-level semantic features of both modalities. We further explore the validity of the internal structure of the cross-modal blocks. In the cross-modal blocks, the self-attention mechanism and the residual structure play an important role in the performance of the model. We detach the self-attention mechanism and the residual structure separately which can be seen that selfattention brings more than 2% impact on the final result. This indicates that the audio semantic features we obtained contain redundant information and can be selected by the self-attention mechanism for feature selection to make it efficient and adaptive for inter-modal interaction. In addition, we also see that the residual structure has less impact on the final results, suggesting that the inclusion of the residual structure helps to ensure that the loss of video features is minimized during the interaction. Furthermore, we observe that the current state-of-the-art can be achieved even without the inclusion of the residual structure, which further demonstrates the efficiency of the cross-modal blocks. More, we integrate the audio modality into the video modality as the final fusion result in our model design, denoted as V ->A. We have compared the results of integrating video modality into audio modality, denoted as A->V . We find that there is a 1.6% difference between them, which we attribute to the fact that the self-attention mechanism reduces the redundancy of audio features and is more effective for the results. In parallel, the rich spatio-temporal structure of the video modality also has an impact on the final result output.",
