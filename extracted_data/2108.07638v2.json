      "text": "Affective Computing is the study of how computers can recognize, interpret and simulate human affects. Sentiment Analysis is a common task in NLP related to this topic, but it focuses only on emotion valence (positive, negative, neutral). An emerging approach in NLP is Emotion Recognition, which relies on fined-grained classification. This research describes an approach to create a lexical-based weakly supervised corpus for fine-grained emotion in Portuguese. We evaluate our dataset by fine-tuning a transformer-based language model (BERT) and validating it on a Gold Standard annotated validation set. Our results (F1-score= .64) suggest lexical-based weak supervision as an appropriate strategy for initial work in low resourced environment. Resumo. A Computac ¸ão Afetiva é o estudo de como os computadores podem reconhecer, interpretar e simular os afetos humanos. A Análise de Sentimento é uma tarefa comum em PLN, mas se concentra apenas na valência da emoc ¸ão (positiva, negativa, neutra). Uma abordagem emergente é o Reconhecimento de Emoc ¸ão, que depende de uma classificac ¸ão refinada. Nesta pesquisa, descrevemos uma abordagem de supervisão fraca baseada em Itens Lexicais para criar um corpus de emoc ¸ões refinadas em português. Avaliamos nosso corpus fazendo o ajuste fino de um modelo de linguagem baseado em Transformer (BERT) e avaliando-o em um conjunto de validac ¸ão anotado. Nossos resultados (F1-score= .64) sugerem que a supervisão fraca baseada em Itens Lexicais pode ser uma estratégia apropriada para o trabalho inicial em ambiente de poucos recursos.",

      "text": "Affective Computing comprises the study of how computers can recognize, interpret and simulate human affects. According to Picard  [Rosalind 2000 ], a field pioneer, it is imperative to develop ways for computers to be able to recognize, understand and express emotions for intelligent and natural interaction between humans and machines. Although Affective Computing may employ several input types such as facial expression images, voice, or physiological data, our research focuses on the written language. Thus, our scope lies in the area of Natural Language Processing (NLP).\n\nA common task in NLP is Sentiment Analysis which classifies a text into three different categories: positive, negative, and neutral  [Drus and Khalid 2019] . The Emotion Recognition task, however, is a more detailed NLP task. Rather than classifying text only into valence categories (positive, negative, or neutral), it classifies text into more detailed emotional categories.\n\nThe delimitation of this research is concentrated in the area of fine-grained Emotion Recognition. We studied an approach to create a corpus in Portuguese for this task using a weak supervision approach.",

      "text": "Several works in NLP are based on the theory of basic emotions  [Ekman 1992 ] to classify texts into defined categories of emotions, the number of categories ranging from 4 (four) to 8 (eight). One of the studies adopted the 6 (six) basic emotions proposed by Ekman (joy, fear, anger, sadness, surprise, and disgust) to train an Emotion Recognition model  [Batbaatar et al. 2019 ]. Another research added trust and anticipation to the basic emotions, working with 8 (eight) basic emotion categories [Sosea and Caragea 2020].\n\nIn the realm of emotion study, other relevant theory is the Theory of Constructed Emotion [Barrett 2016], which assumes that emotions are not universal, but idiosyncratic. This theoretical debate imposes methodological limitations that a different computational approach may help to solve. The Semantic Space Theory  [Cowen and Keltner 2021 ] let us recognize and analyze emotional content of naturalistic stimuli, using open-ended statistical techniques to capture emotional variations in behavior. The results suggest that more than 25 emotional classes have distinct profiles of previous expressions and events. The authors argue that these emotions are high-dimensional, categorical, and often blended.\n\nGoEmotions is a dataset with more than 58,000 English Reddit comments for training NLP models in the Emotion Recognition task. It was annotated for 27 categories of emotions and Neutral based on the Semantic Space Theory. The authors fine-tuned a BERT language model and achieved an average F 1 -score of .46  [Demszky et al. 2020 ].\n\nDespite the average F 1 -score below .50, some classes scored above .70. It is a complex dataset with many categories that often have fuzzy boundaries between them. It is essential to discuss the importance of creating a fine-grained dataset with more emotional categories. Research in the Affective Computing area is not limited to Sentiment Analysis or categories proposed by the basic theory.\n\nAlthough the GoEmotion dataset was released according to open data standards  [Demszky et al. 2020] , the scope of the corpus is limited to English, which makes it difficult to use in applications in other languages. One of the challenges that Machine Learn-ing faces is dealing with a low-resourced environment (when the data available is not enough to train the models). This phenomenon can happen in specific domains of applications but also in specific geographic regions.\n\nIn the area of NLP, there is a lack of datasets and corpus available in many languages. It is the case of Portuguese, which has a small amount of Sentiment Analysis datasets when compared to English [Pereira 2021]. It is worth noting that we searched for a dataset of fine-grained emotion, but we did not find any in Portuguese.",

      "text": "This research aims to study the creation of a corpus of fine-grained emotions for low resourced languages, specifically Portuguese. Due to limited financial resources, a specific objective of this work is to study the use of the weak supervision strategy to construct our corpus. Weak supervision is a strategy when there is no human annotation of each data point, but the labels are attributed using noisy and limited sources or specific rules. We proposed the following research questions (RQ) to guide our work: RQ1: Is the weak supervision strategy suitable for building an NLP corpus for the finegrained Emotion Recognition task in a low resourced environment? RQ2: What is a proper weak supervision approach to construct a corpus for fine-grained Emotion Recognition tasks in NLP?\n\nOur first hypotheses (H1) is that weak supervision could be a suitable strategy to build NLP corpus for emotion recognition. Our second hypotheses (H2) is that lexicalbased approach can be an adequate strategy to collect samples for each of the categories of our dataset, using the Lexical Items (LI) as a criterion for defining the label in an adequate way for Portuguese. A third hypothesis (H3) is that using SOTA Machine Learning techniques (specifically Transformers-based language models), combined with masking techniques in the LI presented in the weakly supervised corpus, can avoid the model overfit the learning phase.\n\nTo answer RQ1 and RQ2 and validate our hypotheses, we prepared an experiment to create a weakly supervised corpus in Portuguese and measure its performance by training a classification model. The following sections will describe our experimental protocol, including how we collected and weakly annotated the data, our model architecture, metrics, and results.",

      "text": "The emotion categories for this research were defined from a review of the GoEmotion work  [Demszky et al. 2020 ]. The review process had two stages and the participation of a group of 7 (seven) researchers with different backgrounds (psychology, neuroscience, sociology, communications, cognitive science, and computer science). In the first stage, the researchers discussed and reviewed each emotion in English during a working meeting. They proposed a translation into Portuguese based on the definitions of each emotion. The result of this first stage was a translated list of terms with consensus among the reviewers.\n\nThe second stage was reviewing the categories' definitions in Portuguese to check if they were consistent with the language. The reviewers suggested changing the emotional category cuidado, translated from caring to compaixão, as it is a more broad and blended category in the Portuguese language. The second proposal was the removal of the emotion realization, in the sense of perceiving something, as it is not a much prevalent emotional category in the Portuguese language. Finally, there was a consensus among researchers to add the categories saudade and inveja to the list. We also removed neutral to focus on emotions. The final list consists of 28 emotional categories in total. All emotions and their definitions are presented in Table  1 .",

      "text": "After translating and defining emotions into Portuguese, the next step was to select the Lexical Items that would serve as a filter to search for examples and label assignment rules (weak supervision). For each of the emotions on the list, we initially look for related Lexical Items by synonyms. For this, we use the database available at www.sinonimos.com.br, which has more than 30 thousand synonyms of words and expressions for Portuguese.\n\nBecause some words of emotion presented polysemic behavior, we opted for human curation to select the proper Lexical Items. Only synonyms with a semantic relationship with the definition of emotion were considered. For each Verbal Lexical Item, we collect the different conjugations in the repository www.conjugacao.com.br to cover all tenses and moods in Portuguese. To avoid the negation effect, we manipulated the data as follows: we searched for the combination of the word \"não\" (no/not in Portuguese) or \"nem\" (neither in Portuguese) followed by a Lexical Item in our list. If an example was found, we removed it from our dataset. We also added slang and terms related to emotions that were known to the authors. The result of this step was a list in which each emotion was associated with a set of lexical items, which were later used as a data collection filter and label assignment rule.",

The filters used were the list of terms associated with each emotion. Retweets and replies were considered, keeping only original tweets. Hashtags were removed, but emojis were kept.\n\nIn total, 49179 tweets were collected using a weak supervision approach. Each example received the category label according to the Lexical Item used in the collection. For example, if a tweet was collected because it was filtered by a term associated with the emotion amor, it would be labeled to the amor category.\n\nWe tried to maintain a balanced distribution of examples among the classes, but the results of our collection process suggest that some emotional categories are more prevalent than others. We intend to focus on additional data collection for the categories with the smallest number of examples to achieve a better balance distribution in future work. For the training set, we had a total of 47405 examples. We present in Figure  4 .3 the total number of examples by category and the descriptive statistics of our dataset 1  .",

The masking technique consisted of replacing an LI by [MASK], as can be seen in the examples in Table  2 .\n\nWe ended up with three datasets for training three different models.

We did not apply any Masking technique to this set. Due to limited resources, it was not possible to cross-annotate the validation dataset. Only one annotator annotated each example. For this reason, it is not possible to present any measure of agreement between the annotators.

      "text": "According to the results presented, we argue that the adoption of Weak Supervision may be an appropriate strategy for some NLP activities in low-resource scenarios. The creation of datasets is costly and often prohibitive for some economies, making weak supervision an initial alternative for projects when there are insufficient resources to adopt a human supervision methodology. Our RQ1 inquired whether weak supervision is a proper approach to construct a corpus for fined-grained Emotion Recognition in low resourced environment. We found consistent results when evaluating our models, suggesting that weak supervision is an appropriate approach for initial work in the Emotion Recognition NLP task in Portuguese. The results supports our first hypotheses (H1).\n\nThis research used a Lexical-based approach to collect, and weak supervise the dataset. According to the results achieved and based on our empirical experience during its execution, we argue that this approach can be appropriate for collecting and annotating data in tasks involving narrow scenarios and well-defined problems. The results help us to answer our RQ2 and validate the H2.
