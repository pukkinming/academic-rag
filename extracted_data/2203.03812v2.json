      "text": "Transformer has obtained promising results on cognitive speech signal processing field, which is of interest in various applications ranging from emotion to neurocognitive disorder analysis. However, most works treat speech signal as a whole, leading to the neglect of the pronunciation structure that is unique to speech and reflects the cognitive process. Meanwhile, Transformer has heavy computational burden due to its full attention operation. In this paper, a hierarchical efficient framework, called SpeechFormer, which considers the structural characteristics of speech, is proposed and can be served as a generalpurpose backbone for cognitive speech signal processing. The proposed SpeechFormer consists of frame, phoneme, word and utterance stages in succession, each performing a neighboring attention according to the structural pattern of speech with high computational efficiency. SpeechFormer is evaluated on speech emotion recognition (IEMOCAP & MELD) and neurocognitive disorder detection (Pitt & DAIC-WOZ) tasks, and the results show that SpeechFormer outperforms the standard Transformer-based framework while greatly reducing the computational cost. Furthermore, our SpeechFormer achieves comparable results to the state-of-the-art approaches.",

      "text": "Speech signal is able to express the most information in the simplest way  [1] . Speech based emotion and neurocognitive disorder analysis, which is collectively referred to as cognitive speech signal processing (CoSSP), has covered a wide area of applications, including speech emotion recognition (SER), depression classification, Alzheimer's disease (AD) detection and so on. Because of its broad application value, CoSSP is becoming an increasing interest in speech signal processing field.\n\nIn the last century, Hidden Markov model, which is a statistical Markov model and assumes the system being modeled to be a Markov process, is proposed to model speech signal  [2, 3] . After that, more and more machine learning methods, such as decision tree  [4, 5]  and restricted Boltzmann machine  [6, 7]  and so on, are applied to CoSSP. Recently, with the development of deep learning, Convolutional Neural Network  [8, 9, 10, 11] , Recurrent Neural Network and its variants  [12, 13, 14, 15]  are proposed and achieve promising results. After that, deep learning methods deliver superior performances in CoSSP filed.\n\nInspired by the global attention mechanism, Transformer  [16] , which is outstanding in modeling long-range dependencies in the sequence, has achieved great success in natural language processing (NLP). Although the original Transformer is The natural structure of a speech signal, in which several frames constitute a phoneme, several phonemes constitute a word, and multiple words form an utterance in speech signal.\n\ndesigned for machine translation task in NLP, researchers are active in investigating its adaptation to many other fields, specifically computer vision  [17, 18] . Certainly, several attempts also have been made in CoSSP field  [19, 20, 21, 22] . However, most studies omit the natural characteristics of speech while using the attention with Transformer, leading to the neglect of the pronunciation structure that is unique to speech and conveys lots of messages. For example, even if I don't understand Greek, I can still determine the emotion in a Greek recording by utilizing the characteristics in speech, such as articulation, prolongation and the dynamic change of speech sound. Meanwhile, Transformer has heavy computational burden, as the computational complexity of its full attention is quadratic to input length. In other words, the standard Transformer needs to incorporate the characteristics of speech before all its performance can be exploited in CoSSP field.\n\nTo solve the above problems, we should rethink the structure of speech signal first. As shown in Figure  1 , we can observe that an utterance consists of several words, a word consists of several phonemes (e.g. word 'WANT' includes phonemes 'W', 'AA1', 'N' and 'T') and a phoneme consists of several frames (e.g. phoneme 'AA1' includes four frames). This progressive structure reveals the importance of the interaction between adjacent elements and indicates that we can model the speech signal hierarchically based on the nature of pronunciation. Therefore, a hierarchical framework, called SpeechFormer, which consists of frame, phoneme, word and utterance stages, is proposed to model the signal step-by-step. Firstly, we capture the frame, phoneme and word-level features through the first three stages and merge the features between two successive stages, both of which are performed under the instruction of the characteristics of speech with high computational efficiency. At last, an utterance stage is applied to gather all the word-level features and generate an utterance-level representation for classification. The contributions of this paper can be summarized as follows:  • We propose a hierarchical efficient framework, called SpeechFormer, to serve as a general-purpose backbone for cognitive speech signal processing. SpeechFormer improves the modeling process by incorporating the characteristics of speech, which follows the natural pronunciation structure of the input speech signal. • We evaluate SpeechFormer on IEMOCAP  [23] , MELD  [24] , Pitt  [25]  and DAIC-WOZ  [26] , and demonstrate that SpeechFormer substantially outperforms the vanilla Transformer-based framework in terms of performance and computational efficiency. Moreovre, SpeechFormer achieves comparable results to the state-of-the-art approaches. Our codes are publicly available at https: //github.com/HappyColor/SpeechFormer.",

Multiple words are arranged together to form an utterance that is recorded in a wave file. In data format terms, the digital speech signal is divided into numerous frames. Each frame contains information at that particular point in time. Therefore, frame is the basic processing unit in digital system, which then gradually forms a phoneme, a word, and finally an utterance. Time duration. The frame length is literally the size of the window during, which can be set manually. Phonemes are of different lengths, varying from 50 ms to 200 ms. To analyse the duration of word, we use P2FA  [28]  to extract the phonemes from corpora used and find that more than 90% of words contain less than 5 phonemes. Thus, the duration of word is considered as 250 ms to 1000 ms (5× the duration of phoneme). Time duration divided by hop is the approximate number of tokens in the feature, where hop indicates the feature's hop length.",

      "text": "The only difference between SpeechFormer block and standard Transformer is the replacement of MSA with Speech-MSA. As shown in Figure  4 , Speech-MSA applies a window Tw to limit the full attention computation to a small scope of adjacent tokens, which can greatly relieve the computational burden. Furthermore, as displayed in Table  1 , the value of Tw ensures that the Speech-MSA in the first three stages can learn the interactions between neighboring frames, phonemes and words, respectively. And in U-Stage, Tw is set to the length of its input such that a global representation is learnt. The complete output of Speech-MSA is calculated by following steps:\n\n(i) Apply for a window Tw according to the current stagelevel. The value and explanation are shown in Table  1 .\n\n(ii) Select the (t -Tw 2 )-th to (t + Tw 2 )-th tokens in K, each performing a scaled dot-product with the t-th token in Q to produce a score. All the scores are concatenated and scaled by Softmax to generate the attention weights.\n\n(iii) Fetch the (t -Tw 2 )-th to (t + Tw 2 )-th tokens in V and calculate the sum of each token multiplied by its weight. The result is the output of the t-th token in Speech-MSA.\n\n(iv) Return to (ii) until the value of t varies from 1 to T .",

      "text": "The merging blocks between each two successive stages refine features under the instruction of the characteristics of speech, making a hierarchical framework which follows the natural structure of speech signal. Each merging block consists of an average pooling layer and a linear layer in succession. The first layer merges M consecutive tokens in the input, where M is the merging scale, and the second layer expands the embedding dimension of the input by a factor of r. Each merging block aims to prepare the appropriate feature for its following stage as input. Specifically, each token should represent a subphoneme in P-Stage such that P-Stage can model the interaction between neighboring phonemes. Therefore, the M1 before P-Stage should be no less than the minimum length of phoneme. Similarly, the M2 before W-Stage should be no less than the minimum length of word. More details are displayed in Table  1 . Pitt corpus is used in AD detection field. The AD patients and healthy controls are asked to take the \"Cookie Theft\" picture description task  [29]  to produce recordings. Experiments are conducted in speaker-independent 10-fold cross-validation strategy. DAIC-WOZ corpus , used in AVEC 2016  [30] , contains recordings labeled depressed / not depressed. Since the labels of test data are not provided, we report the results on validation set.   2 . SGD  [32]  is employed to optimize the model. The number of Transformers N used in baseline framework is 12. The number of heads used in multihead attention is 8. As for the SpeechFormer framework, we introduce two versions with different model sizes and computational complexity. Their hyper-parameters are:\n\n• SpeechFormer-S: The comparison results of the proposed SpeechFormer and the baseline framework on IEMOCAP, MELD, Pitt and DAIC-WOZ are summarized in Table  3 . Speech emotion recognition, Alzheimer's disease detection and depression classification tasks are involved. From Table  3 , we can observe that the model sizes of SpeechFormer-S and baseline are very close, where the former is slightly larger than the later. However, the theoretical computational complexity 1 (FLOPs) of SpeechFormer-S on four corpora are about 10.2%, 15.1%, 13.2% and 7.8% of the baseline, respectively. SpeechFormer-B expands the model size of SpeechFormer-S by approximately two times, while keeping the FLOPs comparable. While conducting speech emotion recognition, the baseline results are lower than those of SpeechFormer, regardless of the feature used. When performing Alzheimer's disease detection, the baseline achieves better WA using Logmel as input. In other cases, SpeechFormer obtains higher performances. As for depression classification, SpeechFormer framework substantially outperforms the baseline in all cases. In summary, our SpeechFormer framework generally outperforms the vanilla Transformer-based framework in terms of performance and computational efficiency.",
