      "text": "Fine-grained emotion recognition aims to identify the emotional type in queries through reasoning and decision-making processes, playing a crucial role in various systems. Recent methods use In-Context Learning (ICL), enhancing the representation of queries in the reasoning process through semantically similar examples, while further improving emotion recognition by explaining the reasoning mechanisms. However, these methods enhance the reasoning process but overlook the decision-making process. This paper investigates decision-making in fine-grained emotion recognition through prototype theory. We show that ICL relies on similarity matching between query representations and emotional prototypes within the model, where emotion-accurate representations are critical. However, semantically similar examples often introduce emotional discrepancies, hindering accurate representations and causing errors. To address this, we propose Emotion In-Context Learning (EICL) 1 , which introduces emotionally similar examples and uses a dynamic soft-label strategy to improve query representations in the emotion reasoning process. A two-stage exclusion strategy is then employed to assess similarity from multiple angles, further optimizing the decision-making process.

      "text": "Emotions  [1] [2] [3]  play a critical role in shaping how people seek, interpret, and respond to information. In applications such as search engines  [4, 5] , recommender systems  [6, 7] , and mental health support  [8, 9] , user queries often contain not only explicit information needs but also implicit emotional expressions. Accurately identifying these emotional cues can enhance search relevance  [10, 11]  and user satisfaction  [12, 13] . To this end, the task of fine-grained emotion recognition has emerged, aiming to classify the emotional categories in queries through reasoning and decision-making process  [14, 15] .\n\nEarly studies train small-scale models to adjust emotion reasoning and decision-making for specific datasets, achieving promising results  [16] [17] [18] [19] [20] . These methods are limited by model size and specific data, making them difficult to adapt to new data distributions and unseen emotions  [21] [22] [23] [24] . Recent studies employ In-Context Learning (ICL), which flexibly adjusts the reasoning and decisionmaking process of large language models (LLMs) using only semantically similar examples, thus enhancing the emotion recognition and generalization  [24, 25] . These methods rely on empirically constructed examples and lack an understanding of ICL's internal mechanisms, limiting improvements in emotion recognition. Meanwhile, other studies explore ICL's internal mechanisms, examining how it integrates example information into query representations from Bayesian  [26] [27] [28] [29] [30] , gradient  [31] [32] [33] [34] , algorithmic learning  [35] [36] [37] [38] , and information flow  [39]  perspectives to facilitate emotion reasoning, as shown in Figure  1 (a). However, emotion recognition involves both reasoning and decision-making processes, and these studies focus only on the reasoning process, i.e., how query representations form, neglecting the decision-making process, i.e., how query representations are transformed into final predictions.\n\nIn this paper, we investigate the decision-making mechanism in ICL for fine-grained emotion recognition. Inspired by neuroscience research on hidden representations in LLMs  [40] [41] [42] , we propose a prompt-pair detection method to reveal that LLMs represent emotion categories with specific hidden representations. In the ICL decision-making process, the more similar a query representation is to a category representation in LLMs, the more likely it is to predict the corresponding emotion, as shown in Figure  1(b) . Viewing category representations as emotional prototypes, this similarity matching phenomenon suggests that ICL's decision-making process aligns with prototype theory  [43] [44] [45] .\n\nFrom the perspective of prototype theory, we identify a flaw in ICL: During the reasoning process, semantically similar examples contribute little to building high-quality query representations in emotion recognition. For example, given the query \"I'm worried about the upcoming major meeting.\" the semantically similar example \"I'm anticipating the upcoming major meeting.\" shares only semantic content and contributes little to emotion reasoning. In contrast, the emotionally similar example \"The eve of a major event often causes anxiety.\" aligns with the query's emotional tone, supplying richer information for emotion reasoning and helping to foster a high-quality query representation. During the decision-making process, relying on similarity between query representations and emotion prototypes amplifies errors when those representations are inaccurate. Semantically similar examples offer little for emotion reasoning, making it hard to form emotionally precise query representations. Under the similarity matching mechanism, the model compares these flawed representations with the LLM's internal emotion prototypes to infer the query's emotion. Since the query representations lack emotional precision, the resulting similarity scores are unreliable, leading to incorrect judgments.\n\nTo address this issue, we propose a simple yet effective Emotion In-Context Learning method (abbreviated as EICL) for fine-grained emotion recognition. It introduces emotionally similar examples and uses a dynamic soft-label strategy to accurately depict their emotions, enhancing emotion reasoning and forming high-quality representations. Additionally, it use a two-stage exclusion strategy to assess similarity from multiple angles, optimizing the decisionmaking process. We perform experiments with five LLMs across four fine-grained emotion datasets: EDOS  [46] , Empathetic Dialogues  [47] , EmpatheticIntent  [48] , and GoEmotions  [49] . The results show that EICL significantly outperforms ICL in fine-grained emotion recognition.\n\nTo sum up, our contributions are as follows:\n\n(i) We introduce a prototype theory perspective to explain ICL's decision-making mechanism, highlighting its reliance on similarity matching between queries and emotional prototypes in LLMs, and addressing the gap in previous work that focused only on the reasoning process. (ii) We propose EICL, offering a comprehensive reasoning and decision-making approach by using emotionally similar examples and a dynamic soft-label strategy to improve emotion reasoning, while optimizing decision-making through a twostage exclusion strategy. (iii) Extensive experiments and analysis show that the proposed method outperforms ICL on multiple datasets.",

      "text": "Basic In-Context Learning. In-Context Learning (ICL) enhances LLMs' performance by learning from constructed examples, avoiding the time and computational costs of fine-tuning. One ICL approach improves LLMs by decomposing reasoning steps of examples into sub-steps, enabling the model to complete tasks by following these steps  [53] [54] [55] . This method has shown strong results in tasks like arithmetic  [56] , commonsense  [53] , and symbolic reasoning  [57] , but requires manual construction and is not always applicable to tasks that can't be easily decomposed. Another approach, retrieval-based ICL, addresses this by retrieving relevant examples from training datasets. It focuses on examples similar to the query in terms of words  [58] [59] [60] , semantics  [61] [62] [63] [64] , structures  [65] , or other relevant aspects  [66] [67] [68] . Most methods rely on the semantic similarity between the query and examples.\n\nIn-Context Learning on Emotion Recognition. ICL on finegrained emotion recognition can be categorized into heuristic-based ICL and exact-based ICL. Heuristic-based ICL enhances emotion recognition by adjusting the reasoning and decision-making processes of LLMs using semantically similar examples  [24, 25] . While heuristic-based ICL relies on empirically constructed examples, it lacks an understanding of ICL's internal mechanisms, limiting its effectiveness. In contrast, exact-based ICL analyzes the reasoning process from multiple perspectives, such as Bayesian  [26] [27] [28] [29] [30] , gradient descent  [31] [32] [33] [34] , algorithmic learning  [35] [36] [37] [38] , and information flow  [39] , to improve query representations and emotion reasoning. However, while these studies explore reasoning, few address the internal mechanisms of decision-making based on these representations. Unlike previous work on reasoning and mechanics, we explore ICL's decision-making, emphasizing similarity matching.\n\nWe then propose emotion in-context learning to enhance ICL's performance in fine-grained emotion recognition.",

However, how these query representations map to emotion categories remains unclear. Recently, the linear representation and superposition hypotheses  [40, 41]  suggest that specific hidden representations in LLMs represent distinct concepts, with LLMs moving closer to these representations when expressing them. This phenomenon offers a new perspective on the decision-making process in ICL. To this end, we propose a prompt-pair detection method to extract category-related representations from LLMs' hidden representations and investigate the relationship between query and category representations during decision-making.",

      "text": "The prompt-pair detection method aims to extract stable category representations. To achieve this, we collect representations of emotion categories in different semantic contexts and extract stable representations from them. Specifically, for an emotion category 𝑐 𝑖 , we select 𝑀 samples from a set 𝑆 that conveys the corresponding emotion. For each sample 𝑠 𝑗 ∈ 𝑆, we construct a positive prompt 𝑃 + and a negative prompt 𝑃 -. The difference between the positive and negative prompts is that the positive prompt uses the target emotion category 𝑐 𝑖 , whereas the negative prompt randomly selects a category from the complete emotion category set 𝐶 in the datasets. The positive prompt is shown in Table  1 . Both prompts are then fed into LLMs to predict the emotion category of the sample. During category prediction, we adopt a curriculum learning strategy that guides the LLMs to generate the corresponding tokens step by step, as formalized below:\n\nwhere 𝑦 + 𝑡 and 𝑦 - 𝑡 represent the tokens generate by the LLM at timestep 𝑡, respectively. 𝑦 + <𝑡 and 𝑦 - <𝑡 represent the tokens generated before time step 𝑡 using the positive and negative prompts, respectively.\n\nAs LLMs are required to produce grammatically, semantically, and emotionally coherent content, their hidden states encode both contextual information (e.g., syntax and semantics) and emotional information. To decouple emotion for category prediction, we construct prompt pairs that share all context but differ only in the emotion, then subtract the hidden state of the negative prompt from that of the positive prompt to remove shared contextual information and isolate the emotion. Concretely, at each time step 𝑡, we extract the hidden representations ℎ 𝑙,+ 𝑡,𝑠 𝑗 and ℎ 𝑙,-𝑡,𝑠 𝑗 for the positive and negative prompts, respectively, and compute their difference to obtain the category representation ℎ 𝑙 𝑡,𝑠 𝑗 , following established methods  [42, 50, 51] . We have:\n\nwhere ℎ 𝑙 𝑡,𝑠 𝑗 , ℎ 𝑙,+ 𝑡, 𝑠 𝑗 , and ℎ 𝑙,-𝑡, 𝑠 𝑗 ∈ R 𝑑 . ℎ 𝑙,+ 𝑡, 𝑠 𝑗 and ℎ 𝑙,-𝑡, 𝑠 𝑗 denote the hidden representations at time step 𝑡 for token 𝑠 𝑗 under the positive and negative prompts, respectively, and ℎ 𝑙 𝑡,𝑠 𝑗 is the resulting category representation. 𝑙 indicates the 𝑙-th layer of the LLM.\n\nWe then collect all category representations derived from each sample into the set 𝑆 𝑙 𝑐 𝑖 and apply principal component analysis (PCA) to extract their first principal component. Through this extraction, we obtain a common and stable representation 𝐻 𝑙 𝑐 𝑖 ∈ 𝑅 𝑑 of category 𝑐 𝑖 across different samples. We have:\n\n3.1.1 Category Representation Visualization. Representations produced by neuroscience-based prompting methods are stable and robust  [42, 50, 51] . As a neuroscience-based prompting method, our prompt-pair detection method inherits these advantages when constructing the category representation 𝐻 𝑙 𝑐 𝑖 . Nevertheless, we further validate them using Llama3.1 8𝑏 on the ED dataset  [47] . We average 𝐻 𝑙 𝑐 𝑖 layer by layer to obtain 𝐻 𝑐 𝑖 . Based on the representations 𝐻 𝑐 𝑖 , we compute cosine similarities between category vectors and normalize the scores to [0, 1], as shown in Figure  2 . The results reveal that categories of similar emotions yield higher similarity scores, while dissimilar ones yield lower scores. Overall, these results confirm the validity of our category representations and lay a solid foundation for the following investigation.",

Figure  3  shows the results, where the x-axis represents emotion categories sorted by dot product (similarity) in descending order, and the y-axis represents the probability of predicting each emotion. The results show that as the similarity decreases, the probability of predicting the emotion also decreases. From the perspective of prototype theory  [43] [44] [45] , treating category representations as prototypes, we find that the closer a query hidden representation is to the emotional prototype, the higher the probability of predicting the corresponding emotion.

Consequently, ICL fails to incorporate genuinely emotion-aligned examples into its reasoning, resulting in inaccurate query representations. To address this issue, we use a dynamic soft-label strategy to assign specific labels to examples, accurately depicting their emotions to aid emotion reasoning.

This strategy considers both the primary emotion categories and their similarity to prototypes, increasing their prediction probability and reducing decision errors. The prediction process is defined as follows:\n\n5 Experiments\n\nEmotion Auxiliary Models and Datasets. To validate the proposed method, we conduct experiments using two emotion auxiliary models, RoBERTa 𝑒𝑖 and RoBERTa 𝑔𝑒 , on four fine-grained emotion datasets: EDOS  [46] , Empathetic-Dialogues (ED)  [47] , EmpatheticIntent (EI)  [48] , and GoEmotions (GE)  [49] . For convenience, we refer to the emotion auxiliary models and datasets as RoBERTa 𝑒𝑚𝑜 and 𝐷 𝑡 𝑦𝑝𝑒 , where 𝑒𝑚𝑜 ∈ 𝐸𝐼, 𝐺𝐸 and 𝑡𝑦𝑝𝑒 ∈ 𝐸𝐼, 𝐺𝐸, 𝐸𝐷, 𝐸𝐷𝑂𝑆. Note that our goal is to verify the performance of EICL without fine-tuning, so the emotion auxiliary model used during reasoning should not have been fine-tuned on the respective dataset, i.e., 𝑒𝑚𝑜 ≠ 𝑡𝑦𝑝𝑒.\n\nSimultaneously, the emotion categories predicted by the emotion auxiliary model do not fully align with those of the datasets, rendering the exclusion strategy inapplicable. To address this issue, we adjust the datasets according to the emotion auxiliary model. For example, for the RoBERTa 𝑒𝑖 emotion auxiliary model  [48]  and the GoEmotions dataset, we first identify the emotion categories they share. Then, we select data from GE that falls within these common emotion categories for experimentation. Evaluation Metrics. We evaluate the methods using accuracy and macro-F1 (F1). Accuracy (Acc) measures the proportion of correctly predicted samples. F1 is the harmonic mean of precision and recall, considering both metrics. It accounts for each class's F1 score and is robust to class imbalance.\n\nBaselines. To validate EICL, we conduct experiments on several large language models, including Phi-3.5-mini, Mistral-Nemo, Llama3.1 8𝑏 , Claude-Haiku, and ChatGPT-Turbo. For each model, we construct zero-shot learning (Z-shot) and in-context learning (ICL) as baselines.The zero-shot baseline considers only the query, while the in-context learning baseline includes examples semantically related to it. Implementation Details. In our experiments, we use two emotion auxiliary models, RoBERTa 𝑒𝑖 and RoBERTa 𝑔𝑒 , both with a hiddenlayer dimension of 𝑑 𝑒𝑚𝑜 =768. The former is applied to the GE, ED, and EDOS datasets, while the latter is used for EI, ED, and EDOS. During the construction of example-label pairs, we set the example number to 𝑘 1 =5 and the weight for soft labels to 𝛼=0.2. The values of 𝑘 2 (the number of soft labels) and 𝑘 3 (the number of primary emotion candidates) vary based on the data, emotion auxiliary models, and LLMs. A detailed analysis of these factors is provided in Section 6.2.",

The results demonstrate that ICL outperforms Z-shot across most metrics, indicating that semantically similar examples benefit emotional reasoning. Additionally, EICL outperforms both ICL and Z-shot on most metrics, primarily due to emotion-similar examples, dynamic soft-label strategies, and the two-stage exclusion strategy, all of which improve emotional reasoning and decision-making.\n\nHowever, some anomalies are observed: (i) In datasets like GE (in Table  2 ) and EDOS (in Table  3 ), ICL performs worse than Z-shot. This is due to the models' weaker emotional capabilities. For instance, Llama3.1 8𝑏 struggles to interpret emotions accurately, even when beneficial examples are provided. (ii) EICL performs poorly on certain datasets. Llama3.1 8𝑏 and Claude-Haiku, in particular, perform below baselines. This is primarily due to these models' difficulty in recognizing certain emotions, as their inherent limitations cannot be fully overcome, even with effective strategies and examples (detailed explanation, see Section 6.3). In contrast, models like Phi-3.5-mini and ChatGPT-Turbo, with stronger emotional perception, benefit more from the proposed methods. (iii) On the GE dataset, EICL on models like Mistral-Nemo and Llama3.1 8𝑏 shows lower accuracy. This is primarily due to the dataset's bias, where the \"neutral\" category comprises 1606 samples out of 3442, accounting for 46.65% of the total data. In such a biased dataset, the F1 score is more reliable, and our method outperforms the baseline on this metric, demonstrating the effectiveness of the proposed method. The results show that removing all modules leads to a decline in model performance, demonstrating the effectiveness of the modules. For ChatGPT-Turbo, removing Emotion-Similar Retrieval (W/O EER), the Two-Stage Exclusion Prediction Strategy (W/O TE), and the Dynamic Soft-Label Strategy (W/O DSL) all result in significant performance drops. This indicates that all three methods contribute to enhancing EICL's emotional reasoning and decision-making abilities. For Claude-Haiku, removing Emotion-Similar Retrieval (W/O EER) and the Two-Stage Exclusion Strategy (W/O TE) leads to a significant decline in performance. However, removing the Dynamic Soft-Label Strategy (W/O DSL) causes only a minor decrease. This suggests that Claude-Haiku already benefits from sufficient emotional reasoning and decision-making capabilities through similar examples and the two-stage exclusion strategy, while the dynamic soft-label strategy also helps with query understanding to some extent.   Figure  8a  shows results with a strong emotion auxiliary model, while Figure  8b  shows results with a weaker one. Most results suggest that using a moderate number of emotions as candidates yields optimal performance, highlighting the effectiveness of the two-stage exclusion strategy. In some cases, using all emotions as candidates leads to more accurate predictions, particularly when the emotion auxiliary model's performance is much lower, such as being 15 points below the LLMs (see Section 6.2.5). In these cases, EICL tends to exclude accurate emotions, causing the strategy to fail.  Figure  9a  illustrates the performance of smaller LLMs, showing that Mistral-Nemo and Phi-3.5-mini perform notably well, while Llama3.1 8𝑏 demonstrates weaker capabilities, excelling only in the emotions of \"ashamed, \" \"angry, \" and \"hopeful. \" Figure  9b  presents the performance of larger LLMs, indicating that ChatGPT-Turbo offers a more comprehensive and balanced emotional capacity, while Claude-Haiku shows advantages only in \"confident\" and \"caring\" emotions. Overall, for similar LLMs, Llama3.1 8𝑏 and Claude-Haiku display relatively weak emotional perception abilities. For larger LLMs, ChatGPT-Turbo has more comprehensive emotional capability compared to Claude-Haiku.",

Figure  10a  shows the results for Llama3.1 8𝑏 , while Figure  10b  shows the results for ChatGPT-Turbo. According to the results, ICL shows a notable improvement over Z-shot. Compared to the first two methods, EICL demonstrates significant improvements in recognizing a wide range of emotions, highlighting the effectiveness of the method.",

      "text": "In this paper, we have examined the decision-making mechanism of in-context learning (ICL) in fine-grained emotion recognition from a prototype theory perspective. We have demonstrated that ICL's decision-making aligns with prototype theory and shown that semantically similar examples can cause errors in emotion reasoning and decision-making. Building on these insights, we have proposed a new perspective with emotion in-context learning, which enhances emotion reasoning with emotionally similar examples and dynamic soft-label strategies, and optimizes decision-making through a two-stage exclusion strategy. Experiments conducted on four datasets demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms traditional ICL methods. This work uses emotional prototypes within LLMs to explore the decision-making mechanism of ICL in emotion recognition. Research has shown that LLMs contain not only emotional prototypes but also broader knowledge prototypes, allowing the proposed method to be applied to other tasks  [40] [41] [42] . To further investigate ICL and LLMs' internal mechanisms, we will explore and validate them in more tasks in the future.",
