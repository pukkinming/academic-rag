      "text": "Sentiment analysis is a crucial task that aims to understand people's emotional states and predict emotional categories based on multimodal information. It consists of several subtasks, such as emotion recognition in conversation (ERC), aspect-based sentiment analysis (ABSA), and multimodal sentiment analysis (MSA). However, unifying all subtasks in sentiment analysis presents numerous challenges, including modality alignment, unified input/output forms, and dataset bias. To address these challenges, we propose a Task-Specific Prompt method to jointly model subtasks and introduce a multimodal generative framework called UniSA. Additionally, we organize the benchmark datasets of main subtasks into a new Sentiment Analysis Evaluation benchmark, SAEval. We design novel pre-training tasks and training methods to enable the model to learn generic sentiment knowledge among subtasks to improve the model's multimodal sentiment perception ability. Our experimental results show that UniSA performs comparably to the state-ofthe-art on all subtasks and generalizes well to various subtasks in sentiment analysis.",

      "text": "Sentiment analysis is a discipline that leverages multimodal data to extract human opinions and comments, as well as comprehend and categorize human emotions. Generalized sentiment analysis encompasses a plethora of subtasks, such as emotion recognition in conversation (ERC), aspect-based sentiment analysis (ABSA), and multimodal sentiment analysis (MSA). Initially, research focused solely on individual subtasks; nevertheless, it has become evident that there is an interrelated sentiment knowledge among these subtasks. Hence, integrating all subtasks into a single model to enhance the sentiment understanding ability of the model has emerged as a significant objective. Following the lead of unified multi-task modeling in other domains, recent studies have explored the potential of jointly modeling some subtasks, e.g., Hu et al.  [18]  jointly modeled the ERC and MSA to boost the performance of both tasks, Yan et al.  [70]  converted all ABSA subtasks a unified generative formulation, which yielding encouraging results. Nevertheless, no research has yet been conducted on the joint modeling of all sentiment analysis subtasks (ERC, MSA, ABSA, etc.) as a single research object.\n\nThe unified modeling of all subtasks of sentiment analysis presents three primary challenges: 1) Format. The input formats and analysis views of each subtask vary. For example, MSA analyzes emotional tendencies based on single-turn utterances, ERC comprehensively assesses speaker emotions through contextual information in dialogues, and ABSA extracts attribute words from utterances and judges emotional tendencies based on those words. Jointly training these subtasks, each with different input and output formats, is the first challenge. 2) Alignment. Some subtasks use multimodal data (e.g., ERC), while others use single-modal data (e.g., speech emotion recognition). The data formats and representations for different modalities (text, acoustic, visual, etc.) differ, and each modality expresses emotional information in its unique way. For example, text modality uses sentiment words, attribute words, modal words, and negative words to express sentiments, while the acoustic modality mainly uses acoustic parameters such as intensity, pitch, speaking rate, and pauses to express the speaker's emotional fluctuations.",

The visual modality expresses human emotion through facial expressions, body posture, and eye gaze. Aligning the emotional information across modalities presents the second challenge. 3) Bias.\n\nSentiment analysis is a highly subjective task, and ensuring that the model learns universal human sentiment knowledge while being less affected by subjectivity bias is the third challenge. Additionally, dataset annotation bias may affect the quality of multimodal data with high-quality annotations, making it difficult to train models that can generalize across different datasets.\n\nIn response to the challenges of sentiment analysis, we reorganize the sentiment analysis subtasks into two categories, namely main tasks and downstream tasks, based on their relevance to sentiment. As shown in Figure  1 , the main tasks, which are the subtasks most correlated with human emotional representation, include ABSA, MSA, ERC, and Comment Analysis (CA). Downstream tasks include tasks related to sentiment analysis but not necessarily detecting human emotion categories, such as irony detection, humor detection, and emoji prediction. Meanwhile, we propose a novel multimodal sentiment analysis framework, named UniSA 1 , which takes the first step toward unified modeling of all sentiment analysis main tasks and generalizes to downstream tasks.\n\nSpecifically, to tackle the first challenge of unifying input and output forms across different subtasks, we introduce the task-specific prompt method which treats all subtasks as generation tasks and jointly trains them. The second challenge of aligning emotional information across different modalities is addressed by extending the generative Transformer  [64]  architecture to process multimodal data and proposing the modal mask training method to learn the inter-modality relationship. The third challenge of learning the 1 The UniSA is available at : https://github.com/dawn0815/UniSA difference between subtasks is tackled by introducing dataset embedding to bridge the annotation bias between different datasets. In order to evaluate the performance of our proposed framework, UniSA, we collate benchmark datasets for each subtask and construct a new sentiment analysis benchmark, SAEval, as illustrated in Table  1 . The details of this benchmark are presented in Section 3.\n\nThe contributions of this paper can be summarized as follows:\n\n• We advance a novel approach to sentiment analysis, UniSA, which unifies all subtasks under a single generative framework. This represents a significant advancement in the field, as no previous work has taken such a comprehensive approach to sentiment analysis. • We propose novel sentiment-related pre-training tasks that allow the model to learn generic sentiment knowledge across subtasks. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that UniSA performs comparably to the state-of-the-art on all subtasks. • We curate a benchmark dataset, SAEval, which comprises benchmark datasets for various sentiment analysis subtasks in a unified format, enabling comprehensive and fair evaluation of sentiment analysis models.",

      "text": "We provide a brief overview of the recent advancements in various subfields of sentiment analysis. Aspect-based sentiment analysis (ABSA) is a task that aims to identify the sentiment polarity associated with aspect terms in a single-turn utterance. Previous works   [33, 37, 66] . Recent research on ABSA has explored the application of sequence-to-sequence learning and pre-trained language models to achieve promising results  [26, 36] . Multimodal sentiment analysis involves identifying the speaker's emotion from a single-turn utterance by considering multiple modalities. Early research in this area primarily focused on geometric manipulation in feature spaces  [75, 76] . Recent research on multimodal sentiment analysis has emphasized the importance of modal consistency and difference through multi-task joint learning  [74]  or modal translation  [39] , leveraging cross-modality and multi-scale modality representation to implement the modal alignment  [35, 63] .\n\nComment analysis involves identifying the user's emotion from one or more sentences in a comment. Recent works  [57, 68, 72]  in this field have used pre-trained language models, such as BERT  [5] , RoBERTa  [34] , and XLNet  [72] , to fine-tune comment datasets and achieve promising results.\n\nEmotion recognition in conversation aims to identify the speaker's emotion from multiple utterances in a conversation  [8, 31, 51, 60] . Early research focused on context modeling using GRU  [6]  models to extract context information and judge the emotion category of the utterance based on the context information  [9, 12, 17, 40, 49] . More recent research has introduced GCN models  [11]  into conversation scene modeling, where each utterance in the conversation  [32, 80]  is regarded as a node in the graph, and the relationship between utterances constitutes the edge connecting the nodes  [10, 19, 25, 59 ]. The most recent works in this area employ Transformer architecture and self-attention mechanisms to capture contextual information of utterances and achieve state-of-the-art performance in emotion recognition in conversations  [20, 27, 30, 41, 58] .",

Recently, large multimodal models such as ERNIE Bot  [65]  and GPT-4  [46]  have achieved remarkable results and have attracted attention from researchers in various fields.\n\nIn the sentiment analysis field, Yan et al.  [70]  employed an improved BART  [23]  architecture to solve all ABSA subtasks in an end-to-end framework. Hu et al.  [18]  proposed a multimodal sentiment knowledge-sharing framework that unifies MSA and ERC tasks from features, labels, and models. These multi-task unified works in various fields support the feasibility of unified modeling for all sentiment analysis subtasks.
