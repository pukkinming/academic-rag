      "text": "The recent release of GPT-4o showcased the potential of end-to-end multimodal models, not just in terms of low latency but also in their ability to understand and generate expressive speech with rich emotions. While the details are unknown to the open research community, it likely involves significant amounts of curated data and compute, neither of which is readily accessible. In this paper, we present BLSP-Emo (Bootstrapped Language-Speech Pretraining with Emotion support), a novel approach to developing an end-to-end speechlanguage model capable of understanding both semantics and emotions in speech and generate empathetic responses. BLSP-Emo utilizes existing speech recognition (ASR) and speech emotion recognition (SER) datasets through a two-stage process. The first stage focuses on semantic alignment, following recent work on pretraining speech-language models using ASR data. The second stage performs emotion alignment with the pretrained speech-language model on an emotion-aware continuation task constructed from SER data. Our experiments demonstrate that the BLSP-Emo model excels in comprehending speech and delivering empathetic responses, both in instruction-following tasks and conversations. 1 * Work was done while at Alibaba. † Corresponding author. 1 Visit https://github.com/cwang621/blsp-emo for code and https://cwang621.github.io/blsp-emo. github.io for demo.

      "text": "Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in intent understanding  (Lu et al., 2023) , instruction following  (Chung et al., 2022) , and problem-solving  (Achiam et al., 2023; Touvron et al., 2023) , revolutionizing humanmachine interaction. Speech, as the primary mode of human communication, conveys rich paralinguistic features related to emotions, tones, and in-Figure  1 : Illustrative example of an empathetic large language model responding to speeches with identical linguistic content but different emotional tones.\n\ntentions that cannot be fully captured in text. Figure  1  illustrates that LLMs equipped with the ability to understand both linguistic content and emotion cues in speech can enhance interaction experiences by providing empathetic responses.\n\nRecent work on end-to-end modeling of speech inputs with LLMs falls into two categories. The first category focuses on adapting LLMs for a wide range of speech and audio-related tasks, such as speech recognition, translation, and emotion recognition  (Rubenstein et al., 2023; Chen et al., 2023) . However, these models lack the ability to retain the general instruction-following capabilities of LLMs and cannot engage in conversations with speech inputs. The second category aims to extend LLMs' instruction-following capability to speech inputs, enabling direct speech interaction with LLMs  (Zhang et al., 2023; Wang et al., 2023a) . Nevertheless, these approaches primarily focus on the semantics in speech and fail to capture paralinguistic cues related to emotions. Some studies have attempted to train models to understand emotions in speech and respond empathetically  (Xue et al., 2023; Lin et al., 2024) . However, these efforts rely on speech instruction data constructed with expressive text-to-speech synthesis tools, which limits their generalization capability with natural human speech. Annotating large quantities of new emotion-sensitive instruction or conversation data for natural speech would be costly.\n\nIn this paper, we present the BLSP-Emo approach, which aims to develop an end-to-end speech-language model capable of understanding semantics and emotions in speech and generating empathetic responses, using only existing speech recognition (ASR) and speech emotion recognition (SER) datasets. BLSP-Emo builds upon recent work on speech-language models developed with the BLSP method  (Wang et al., 2023a (Wang et al., , 2024)) , which are bootstrapped from and aligned at the semantic level with an LLM using ASR data. These speech-language models exhibit generation behaviors consistent with the LLM when presented with speech input containing the same linguistic content.\n\nWe propose to perform emotion alignment to understand emotions, in addition to semantics, in speech and generate empathetic responses. Specifically, we first prompt an LLM to generate emotionaware continuations of transcripts in the SER data given the reference emotion label. We then adapt a speech-language model bootstrapped from the same LLM to generate these continuations directly from speech. This adaptation step encourages the model to comprehend and react to both the linguistic content and paralinguistic emotion cues in speech, generating text continuations that are aligned with those the LLM would produce if provided with the same linguistic content and emotion label.\n\nThe contributions of our work are as follows:\n\n• We introduce a new empathetic large speechlanguage model, adapted from an instructionfollowing LLM, that can understand and respond to emotion cues in speech with empathy, while maintaining its ability to follow speech instructions and engage in conversations.\n\n• We develop a two-stage approach to adapt LLMs to empathetic large speech-language models, using existing ASR data for semantic alignment and SER data for emotion alignment, aiming to ensure that responses to speech input align with those the LLMs would produce if provided with the same linguistic content and emotion label.\n\n• We conduct quantitative evaluations and provide demonstrations to showcase that the BLSP-Emo approach enables LLMs with competitive capabilities to perform standalone speech emotion recognition, generate empathetic responses, and engage in empathetic conversations.",

The core concept is that if speech and text are well-aligned, the LLM's text generation behavior given speech input should closely match its behavior when given the corresponding transcript. This alignment is accomplished by training on synthesized speech instruction data derived from existing ASR datasets with a continuation prompt as follows:\n\nUser: Continue the following sentence in a coherent style: <transcript> Assistant:\n\nThis process extends an ASR training sample (s, x) into a tuple (s, x, y), where y is the LLM's response, representing a natural continuation of the transcript x and the corresponding speech s.

      "text": "As studied in  Busso et al. (2008) ;  Castro et al. (2019) , humans convey emotions in speech through both linguistic and paralinguistic cues. A model trained with the BLSP approach captures the linguistic cues for emotion but lacks the ability to understand paralinguistic cues, as it is aligned at the semantic level based on linguistic content. Ideally, an emotion-aware speech-language model should be pretrained on large amounts of speech-text data to understand the relationship between paralinguistic emotion cues and linguistic context, and then fine-tuned on emotion-aware speech instruction data, following the training paradigm used for textonly LLMs. However, this approach requires ex-tensive curated data and significant computational resources, neither of which is readily accessible.\n\nOur approach to emotion alignment builds upon and extends the behavior alignment method by creating natural continuations of speech transcripts that reflect the emotional tones in the speech. This is achieved by leveraging existing speech emotion recognition (SER) datasets. Given a sample (s, x, e) from a SER dataset, where e is the emotion label annotated for speech s, we prompt the LLM with the following instruction:\n\nUser: Continue the following sentence that reflects a <emotion> emotion tone in a coherent style: <transcript> Assistant:\n\nThis generates a text continuation y of the speech s that is consistent with the emotion label e. We then initialize the BLSP-Emo model with parameters of the BLSP model trained from the semantic alignment stage and fine-tune it to generate these continuations given only the speech as input, as follows:\n\nUser: Continue the following sentence based on the conveyed emotion tone in a coherent style: <speech features> Assistant: <text continuation> This results in the primary emotion alignment loss based on emotion-aware continuations:\n\nWe also introduce an auxiliary speech emotion recognition loss by directly predicting the emotion label e from the hidden states output by the modality adapter, using pooling and a classification layer (with additional parameters η):\n\nIn this emotion alignment stage, we unfreeze the parameters ψ of the speech encoder and parameters ϕ of the LLM, in addition to the parameters θ of the modality adapter and η of the classification layer. This allows the speech encoder to capture paralinguistic emotion cues and provides additional modeling power in the LLM to address the discrepancy between speech and text. We follow the PLoRA approach proposed in  (Dong et al., 2024; Wang et al., 2024)  to adapt parameters ϕ of the LLM. The LoRA module is selectively applied only to speech tokens, preserving the LLM's ability to encode text instructions and generate text.\n\n3 Experiment Setup",

      "text": "Speech Emotion Recognition To prompt the LLM-based generative models to perform the SER task, we use the following prompt:\n\nUser: Please identify the emotion tone of the sentence provided below. Select from the following options: neutral, sad, angry, happy, or surprise. \\n\\nSentence: <transcript|speech> Assistant:\n\nwhere <transcript|speech> represents the transcript for cascaded systems or speech features for end-toend systems. Results are shown in Table  1 .\n\nThe BLSP-Emo model achieves the highest overall recognition accuracy across five test sets, along with the BLSP-SER model, which is fine-tuned from the same BLSP model but specifically for the SER task. BLSP-Emo significantly outperforms all other models, including SALMONN-7B  (Tang et al., 2023) , which adapts a large language model to various speech tasks, including speech emotion recognition.\n\nThe Text|Whisper+LLM cascaded systems achieve comparable or better results than the encoder-based classification models on the MELD and MerBench test sets, but they perform the worst on the IEMOCAP and RAVDESS test sets. This suggests that while an LLM can capture linguistic cues for emotions, the text-only mode limits its ability for comprehensive emotion recognition. The BLSP model can process speech input but cannot pick up paralinguistic cues for emotion as it is only trained with semantic alignment. Conversely, the encoder-based classification models can capture paralinguistic cues but lack a semantic understanding of emotion. In contrast, BLSP-Emo can simultaneously model linguistic and paralinguistic emotion cues in speech, thanks to its end-to-end modeling and two-stage alignment process.\n\nEmpathetic Response Beyond speech emotion recognition, our primary concern is whether the model can understand both the semantic content and paralinguistic emotion cues in speech and generate high-quality, empathetic responses. To evaluate this, we construct a synthetic emotion-aware speech instruction dataset named SpeechAlpaca, derived from the open-source instruction dataset Alpaca-52k  (Taori et al., 2023) . Additionally, we use a modified system prompt 2 that emphasizes both quality and empathy for all systems. We then employ GPT-4 as an evaluator to independently score the responses generated by different systems in terms of quality and empathy on a scale from 0 to 10. For details on test set construction and evaluation prompts, please refer to Appendix D.\n\nThe results are shown in Table  2 . Consistent with findings in the SER evaluation on natural speech, BLSP-Emo achieves the highest emotion recognition accuracy of 83.8% on synthetic speech. Additionally, BLSP-Emo scores competitively in both quality (8.8) and empathy (7.7) as measured by GPT-4. In contrast, the BLSP-SER model, fine-tuned specifically for the SER task, achieves a lower performance in SER (80.3%) and performs poorly in empathetic response (quality: 1.9, empathy: 2.1), as it loses the ability to follow speech instructions learned during semantic alignment.\n\nThe BLSP model, despite having a significantly lower SER score (36.8%), achieves decent ratings in quality (8.6) and empathy (7.1), as it is able to comprehend semantics and linguistic emotion cues thanks to semantic alignment. The improvements from BLSP to BLSP-Emo in all three metrics-SER (36.8% to 83.8%), quality (8.6 to 8.8), and empathy (7.1 to 7.7)-suggest that the BLSP-Emo approach effectively understands both linguistic and paralinguistic emotion cues in speech while maintaining its instruction-following capability, resulting in overall better responses.\n\nThe Text|Whisper+LLM systems achieve a slightly higher quality score (8.9 vs. 8.8) than BLSP-Emo but a lower empathy score (7.4 vs. 7.7) and significantly lower SER scores (40.0% vs. 83.8%). This signifies that while LLMs have a strong capability to capture linguistic emotion cues, they are limited by their inability to understand paralinguistic emotion cues. As the examples in Appendix D show, a text-only LLM can provide an empathetic response to the instruction \"Suggest the best way to avoid a traffic jam\" based on the semantic content alone. However, it cannot provide empathetic responses to a neutral instruction \"Come up with a 5-step process for making a decision\" stated in an angry voice.\n\nThe HuBERT|wav2vec2|WavLM+Whisper+LLM systems with standalone SER modules achieve comparable quality ratings to the Text|Whisper+LLM systems but higher empathy ratings (7.6∼7.8 vs 7.4), further underlining the importance of capturing paralinguistic emotion cues in generating empathetic responses. It is worth noting that these cascaded systems also have slightly higher ratings in quality than BLSP-Emo. We attribute this to the room for improvement in semantic alignment for BLSP pretraining, as the Whisper model contains a separate speech decoder that is trained on significantly more speech data  (Wang et al., 2023a (Wang et al., , 2024)) . Additionally, despite being trained on various speech tasks, large speech-language models like SALMONN  (Tang et al., 2023)  exhibit limitations in following general speech instructions.",

      "section_name": "Multi-Turn Conversation",
      "text": "We next evaluate multi-turn conversations, an important application scenario for empathetic large speech-language models. This evaluation allows us to determine if the emotion understanding capability of BLSP-Emo, learned from a simple emotion-aware continuation task, can generalize to scenarios with extended conversational context. Following a setup similar to  Lin et al. (2024) , whose test set is not publicly available, we extract 3-turn dialogues between two speakers from IEMOCAP  (Busso et al., 2008) , treating the first speaker as the user and the second as the assistant. The conversation history consists of the reference dialog transcripts from the first two turns, plus the current input-either a transcript for a cascaded system or speech features for an end-to-end model-from the user, along with the predicted emotion label if the system has a standalone SER module. The LLM is then prompted to generate a response. For examples, please refer to Appendix E. Given that typical user inputs in conversations are not specific task instructions, we found it difficult for GPT-4 to separately assess quality and empathy as done on SpeechAlpaca. Instead, we employ GPT-4 as an evaluator to determine which system's output is better, based on reference transcripts in the conversation history and the emotion label of the user's most recent input. For details, please refer to Appendix E. As shown in Figure  3 , BLSP-Emo demonstrates higher win rates compared to Whisper+LLM, BLSP, and WavLM+Whisper+LLM. This advantage mirrors BLSP-Emo's comparative performance on SpeechAlpaca, highlighting its capability to understand and respond to paralinguistic emotion cues in speech. Notably, BLSP-Emo's superiority over WavLM+Whisper+LLM is somewhat unexpected, given that the latter performed comparably or slightly better on SpeechAlpaca in both quality and empathy ratings. We speculate that this discrepancy may be attributed to the specific prompt used, which incorporates both the transcript and the recognized emotion tone for the user's last speech input (as illustrated in Appendix E). This could introduce inconsistency compared to the simpler transcript representation of the conversation history. In contrast, BLSP-Emo does not necessitate special prompting for speech input, as it implicitly captures emotion cues in the speech features. While prompt engineering could potentially enhance the performance of WavLM+Whisper+LLM, this also underscores the simplicity and advantage of the BLSP-Emo approach.\n\nLanguage Generalization To explore whether the knowledge learned about emotion cues can generalize across languages, we evaluate zero-shot SER performance on three languages not included during training. As shown in Table  3 , BLSP-Emo achieves the best overall performance across the languages, performing comparably or better than BLSP-SER and significantly better than the other models.",

Directly applying emotion alignment without first performing BLSP semantic alignment leads to a sig-nificant drop in both standalone SER performance and quality/empathy ratings in empathetic response. This underscores the importance of having a bootstrapped speech-language model that is aligned at the semantic level before attending to paralinguistic cues.\n\nFurthermore, incorporating the auxiliary SER classification task proves beneficial for achieving higher performance in speech emotion recognition on natural speech, even though it does not lead to any noticeable differences on the SpeechAlpaca test set or in the evaluation of empathetic responses.",

      "text": "We perform additional analysis comparing our training strategies against two recent approaches in the literature of speech-language models with emotion-aware capabilities.\n\nFirst, we compare our approach to the method of E-chat  (Xue et al., 2023)  and Spoken-LLM  (Lin et al., 2024) , which constructed synthesized emotion-aware speech instruction data using expressive text-to-speech tools and ChatGPT. As noted previously and found in our preliminary studies, models trained on synthesized speech fail to generalize to natural human speech. Given that our approach also requires constructing synthesized emotion-aware continuation data for natural speech, a critical question arises: is it better to use ChatGPT for data construction, as commonly done in the literature, or to use the same LLM that BLSP-Emo is adapted from?\n\nTo address this, we trained a new model named BLSP-ChatGPT, utilizing ChatGPT to generate emotion-aware continuations for emotion alignment, starting from the same pretrained BLSP model as BLSP-Emo. As shown in Table  5 , while BLSP-ChatGPT achieves higher SER performance than BLSP, its quality and empathy ratings in empathetic responses are notably lower. BLSP-ChatGPT performs worse than BLSP-Emo across all metrics. We hypothesize that the emotion-aware continuations generated by ChatGPT may not align well with the likely responses generated by the internal LLM in BLSP-Emo. Consequently, the alignment process may focus on narrowing the distribution gap between ChatGPT and the internal LLM, rather than learning to capture the paralinguistic emotion cues in speech to fit into the aligned semantic space established during semantic alignment.\n\nNext, we compare our approach against the multi-task learning strategy employed by other large speech-language models, such as SALMONN  (Tang et al., 2023) , which aims to understand semantic content and various paralinguistic cues. As demonstrated in previous sessions, BLSP-Emo significantly outperforms SALMONN-7B in both standalone emotion recognition and emotion-aware instruction following. However, a question remains: can we replace the emotionaware continuation task employed in the emotion alignment stage with a multi-task framework involving two tasks: emotion-agnostic continuation and speech emotion recognition?\n\nTo answer this, we use the SER training datasets to construct two tasks: one for standalone SER and another for emotion-agnostic continuation. The resulting model is named BLSP-MultiTask. As shown in Table  5 , while BLSP-MultiTask significantly improves the SER accuracy of the BLSP model, its response quality is lower than that of BLSP. BLSP-MultiTask also performs worse than BLSP-Emo across all metrics. This comparison highlights the importance of the emotion-aware continuation task in developing effective empathetic speech-language models.",

      "text": "Evaluation of Empathy. While our methods for assessing empathetic responses provide valuable insights, there are several limitations. Synthesized speech, as in SpeechAlpaca, lacks variations in factors such as speaker ids and emotion expressions, potentially limiting the accuracy of model performance evaluation on natural human speech. Additionally, in the evaluation of multi-turn conversations on IEMOCAP, we only assess a single-turn response within a multi-turn context. This may not fully capture the model's performance in continuous conversations and how empathetic responses, sometimes repetitive, are perceived from a user experience perspective.\n\nBroader Applicability. Our current approach to modeling emotions in speech relies on a limited number of emotion states annotated in SER datasets. However, human speech has rich expressions of emotions that are more nuanced and may include variations of emotion in lengthy speech segments. Additionally, there are other types of paralinguistic cues in human speech, such as tones and intentions, that are important in communication but not addressed in this work. The two-stage alignment approach, however, could be expanded to achieve general modeling of paralinguistic cues through end-to-end modeling on large speech-text datasets, while retaining instruction-following capabilities. We leave this to future work.",

Models like  Au-dioPaLM (Rubenstein et al., 2023) , VIOLA  (Wang et al., 2023b) , and LauraGPT  (Chen et al., 2023)  have emerged from such efforts, primarily trained through multi-task learning for various speech processing tasks, without utilizing conversational competencies inherent in LLMs. Recent models like SALMONN  (Tang et al., 2023)  and WavLLM  (Hu et al., 2024)  processing abilities using textual instructions, still struggle with following general speech instructions.\n\nOther efforts focus on generalized cross-modal instruction-following capabilities through end-toend frameworks, enabling direct interaction with LLMs via speech, such as SpeechGPT  (Zhang et al., 2023) , LLaSM  (Shu et al., 2023) , and BLSP  (Wang et al., 2023a (Wang et al., , 2024)) . However, these models primarily base responses on linguistic content and cannot utilize paralinguistic features.",

Together, these datasets contribute to a corpus of approximately 70k utterances in English and Chinese. It's worth noting that CMU MOSEI is a multi-emotion-labeled dataset, meaning a speech segment could be annotated with multiple emotions. However, we only utilize the single-label samples from this dataset. In this work, we focus on the five emotion categories that are widely annotated across datasets: neutral, happy, sad, angry, and surprise 3 . To ensure the transcripts provide sufficient semantic content for LLMs to generate meaningful continuations, we filter out samples whose tran-script contains fewer than 5 words in English or fewer than 5 characters in Chinese.\n\nWe evaluate SER performance on both indomain datasets (IEMOCAP session 5, MELD test set) and out-of-domain datasets (RAVDESS (Livingstone and Russo, 2018), MerBench  (Lian et al., 2024) ). Additionally, we report the generalizability of SER performance on three other languages: AESDD  (Vryzas et al., 2018)  for Greek, CaFE  (Gournay et al., 2018)  for French, and RESD  (Vryzas et al., 2018)  for Russian.",

The convolution layers are designed to reduce the length of the speech features by a factor of 8, with each layer having a stride size of 2, a kernel size of 5, and a padding of 2.\n\nDuring the semantic alignment stage, we freeze the speech encoder and LLM, and fine-tune the modality adapter for 1 epoch with a batch size of 768. This process takes about 2.5 days on 4 A100 GPUs. During the emotion alignment stage, we fine-tune the speech encoder, modality adapter, LLM 4  , and SER classifier for 3 epochs with a batch size of 128.

Specifically, we employ GPT-4 to deduce a set of plausible emotional tones from a text instruction in Alpaca-52k, focusing on four distinct emotions (neutral, cheerful, sad, and angry) that are supported by Microsoft's Text-to-Speech (TTS) API 5  . On average, GPT-4 suggests 1.4 plausible emotions per utterance due to ambiguities in determining the emotion state from linguistic content alone. From these, we randomly select one as the emotion label for the instruction. This process is used to select 100 instructions for each of the four emotion categories. Subsequently, we synthesize expressive speech using the selected emotion label with Microsoft's TTS API.\n\nWe present examples of model outputs on the SpeechAlpaca test set in Table  7 . To evaluate the empathetic responses, we use GPT-4 to assess the quality of responses with the prompt in Listing 1 and the empathy of responses with the prompt in Listing 2.\n\nListing 1: Prompt for response quality evaluation on SpeechAlpaca\n\nGiven the original instruction provided by the user , the user ' s emotion tone when delivering the instruction , and the model ' s response to the instruction .
