      "text": "Researchers have reported high decoding accuracy (>95%) using non-invasive Electroencephalogram (EEG) signals for brain-computer interface (BCI) decoding tasks like image decoding, emotion recognition, auditory spatial attention detection, etc. Since these EEG data were usually collected with well-designed paradigms in labs, the reliability and robustness of the corresponding decoding methods were doubted by some researchers, and they argued that such decoding accuracy was overestimated due to the inherent temporal autocorrelation of EEG signals. However, the coupling between the stimulus-driven neural responses and the EEG temporal autocorrelations makes it difficult to confirm whether this overestimation exists in truth. Furthermore, the underlying pitfalls behind overestimated decoding accuracy have not been fully explained due to a lack of appropriate formulation. In this work, we formulate the pitfall in various EEG decoding tasks in a unified framework. EEG data were recorded from watermelons to remove stimulus-driven neural responses. Labels were assigned to continuous EEG according to the experimental design for EEG recording of several typical datasets, and then the decoding methods were conducted. The results showed the label can be successfully decoded as long as continuous EEG data with the same label were split into training and test sets. Further analysis indicated that high accuracy of various BCI decoding tasks could be achieved by associating labels with EEG intrinsic temporal autocorrelation features. These results underscore the importance of choosing the right experimental designs and data splits in BCI decoding tasks to prevent inflated accuracies due to EEG temporal autocorrelation.",

      "text": "A brain-computer interface (BCI) is a type of human-machine interaction that bridges a pathway from the brain to external devices  [1] . Electroencephalogram (EEG) has emerged as a valuable tool for BCI because of its high time resolution, low cost, and good portability  [2] , and algorithms of neural decoding from EEG signals play a role in its practical applications. Recently, deep learning methods have been developed widely for various EEG decoding tasks, and high decoding accuracy was reported. For example, in the task of decoding image classes with EEG recordings, when subjects were required to watch images of different classes, a decoding accuracy of 82.90% was reported for the 40-way classification by Spampinato et al.  [3] . With their EEG dataset, subsequent studies reported a higher decoding accuracy (98.30%,  [4] ), high performance on image retrieval, and even image generation from EEG  [5] ,  [6] ,  [7] .\n\nHowever, it remains unclear what kind of EEG features are learned by the DNN-based models. Some researchers have posited that the high decoding accuracy on the image-evoked EEG dataset was attributed to the block-design paradigm during EEG recording  [8]  [9]  [10] , in which 50 images with the same class label were presented to the subject continuously in one block, and the 40 imageclasses were presented as 40 separate blocks. Due to the existence of temporal autocorrelation of EEG signals, i.e., the temporally nearby data is more similar than the temporally distal  [11] ,  [12] ,  [13] ,  [14] , the models could learn the block-related features rather than the image-related.\n\nTo verify their concerns, Li et al.  [8]  recorded EEG with two experimental designs: block design and rapid-event design. For the rapid-event design, images across the 40 classes were presented alternately and randomly. When the same DNN model was used, it was found that the decoding accuracy was close to Spampinato et al.  [3]  with the block-design EEG data, but it was dramatically decreased to the chance-level (2.50%) with the rapid-event design data. Subsequent work also confirmed the low decoding accuracy for EEG recorded with rapid-event design  [9]    [10] . However, Palazzo et al.  [15]  proposed that temporal autocorrelations only play a marginal role in EEG decoding tasks because they found that EEG data recorded during rest periods (temporal proximity to adjacent blocks) could not be successfully classified as the preceding block label or the succeeding block label.\n\nThey also argued that the rapid-event design seemed to weaken the image-related neural responses due to the possible cognitive load and fatigue effect compared to the block design. Some researchers  [15] ,  [16] ,  [17] ,  [18]  pointed out that block design is essential because humans tend to react more consistently and respond faster when conditions are presented in blocks  [19] ,  [20] . Wilson et al.  [18]  advised that classification work that decodes from block design datasets is the most suitable approach until advances are made to reduce noise.\n\nAlthough the pitfall of overestimated decoding accuracy has been mainly discussed in image decoding tasks, we noticed that similar pitfalls might also exist in various EEG decoding tasks such as in auditory spatial attention detection (ASAD) tasks  [21] ,  [22] ,  [23]    [24] , which involves decoding the subjects auditory attention locus from neural data, and in emotion recognition task  [25]  [26]  [27] , which involves recognizing the subjects emotion type from neural data. Researchers have also found that splitting a continuous EEG from a specific experimental condition into training and test sets would bring higher decoding accuracy in epilepsy detection tasks  [28] , motor imagery decoding tasks  [29] , and so on. All those high decoding accuracy works share the common characteristic: continuously recorded EEG data of a specific class (condition) label are divided into training and test sets (see the top-left of Figure  1 ).\n\nAlthough some studies have mentioned the overestimated decoding accuracy and tried to remind the possible pitfall  [8] ,  [30] , it is difficult to discriminate the influence of the inherent temporal autocorrelation in EEG signals due to the coupling of stimuli-driven neural responses and the temporal autocorrelations. More importantly, due to the lack of an effective formalization, there is not an adequate explanation of how models utilize temporal autocorrelation features for decoding. Furthermore, their concerns only focused on one specific decoding task, and the results and conclusions cannot be generalized to general BCI decoding tasks.\n\nIn this work, the pitfall of various EEG decoding tasks was formulated with a unified framework.\n\nTo completely decouple the temporal autocorrelation features from stimuli-driven neural responses, EEG data were collected from 10 watermelons in this work to construct \"Watermelon EEG\". This method is known as phantom EEG in previous studies  [31] ,  [32] ,  [33] ,  [34] ,  [35] ,  [36] , and the EEG data exclude stimulus-driven neural responses while reserving the temporal autocorrelation features.\n\nFor comparison, a human EEG dataset was also adopted. The watermelon EEG and human EEG were reorganized into three classic neural decoding EEG datasets following their EEG experimental paradigm: image classification (CVPR,  [3] ), emotion recognition (DEAP,  [37] ), and auditory spatial attention decoding (KUL,  [38] ), resulting in six EEG datasets. A sample CNN-based decoding model was used to complete the decoding tasks with the corresponding EEG dataset, and the experimental results revealed that:\n\n1. When the pitfall was formulated with a unique framework, and the temporal autocorrelation was defined as domain features, high decoding accuracy of various BCI decoding tasks could be achieved by associating labels with EEG intrinsic temporal autocorrelation features.",

Adopted from this concept, we regard a period of continuous EEG data with the same class label as a domain. In some BCI works  [3] ,  [4] ,  [21] ,  [22] ,  [23] [24]  [25]  [26] [27] , researches segment the EEG data from the same domain into samples and further split the samples into training and test data (as shown in Figure  1a ) and complete decoding task, such as classification, retrieval and generation (as shown in Figure  1b ). In these cases, the models used in these works would learn the coupled features containing the class-related feature and domain feature (as shown in the middle of the Figure  1c ). The underlying assumption of these works is that the domain feature plays only a margin role in EEG decoding tasks as shown in the left of the Figure  1c . However, we assumed that the domain feature contributes to the high decoding accuracy as shown in the right of the Figure  1c , which is the pitfall we mentioned in Section 1.\n\nTo validate our assumption, we need to formulate the pitfall. Denote 𝐷𝐷 as the domain set, and each domain 𝑑𝑑𝜖𝜖𝐷𝐷 contains many samples. We use 𝑆𝑆 𝑑𝑑 to denote the sample set of the domain 𝑑𝑑.",

Considering the temporal autocorrelation of the EEG data, the domain features of data within the same domain are more similar, while the domain features of data in different domains are more distinct.\n\nFor EEG decoding tasks, we assume the data is generated from a two-stage process. First, each domain is modeled as a latent factor 𝑧𝑧 sampled from some meta domain distribution 𝑝𝑝(•). Second, each data sample x is sampled from a sample distribution conditioned on the domain z and class y:\n\nGiven the sample 𝑥𝑥, the aim of a specific EEG decoding task is to uncover its true class label using the posterior 𝑝𝑝(𝑦𝑦|𝑥𝑥). The quantity can be factorized by the domain factor 𝑧𝑧 as,\n\nWhen we use the Watermelon EEG dataset or use a dataset that is completely unrelated to the current task (e.g., decoding images from an auditory EEG dataset), the class-related feature has none possibility to exist in EEG samples.

      "text": "While many works on EEG decoding have reported high-performance results, we proposed that some of these high-performance may rely on temporal autocorrelation of EEG data. The pitfall may involve different EEG decoding tasks. To clarify this pitfall, the concept of domain was adopted to describe the temporal autocorrelation of a continuous EEG with the same label. EEG data were collected from watermelon as the phantom to exclude the contribution of stimuli-driven neural responses to decoding results. The results showed that a simple CNN network could well learn domain features from EEG data and could associate class labels with domain features.\n\nTo avoid the pitfalls, a feasible approach is to adopt a reasonable data-splitting strategy to avoid training and test sets sharing the common domain features, i.e., a leave-domains-out splitting strategy.\n\nFor instance, a leave-subjects-out data-splitting strategy can be adopted, which entails designating the data from certain participants for training and data from others for testing. Alternatively, for datasets that do not follow a block design, a leave-trials-out strategy may be applied. Prior research has consistently demonstrated that employing a leave-subjects-out splitting strategy precipitates a notable decline in decoding performance  [46] . In some cases, it has been reported that decoding accuracy dropped to the chance level  [8] ,  [47] . The prevalent interpretation is that inter-individual variability  [46]  hampers the generalizability across different subjects. However, we posit that the observed decrement in decoding accuracy is attributable to model overfitting to domain features.\n\nAlthough the leave-subjects-out splitting strategy is designed to prevent the leakage of domain features, the presence of these domain features in the training set can still lead the model to inadvertently exploit them to differentiate between categories during the training phase. The methods and results further support the conclusion can be found in Appendix A.5.\n\nPalazzo et al.  [15]  proposed that the EEG temporal correlation related to baseline drift could be alleviated by high-pass filtering. However, our further experiment proved that the domain feature still exists and that high decoding accuracy could be achieved in any frequency band (see Appendix A.6).\n\nWe argue that the focus should not be exclusively on the elimination of EEG autocorrelation through filtering. Instead, greater emphasis should be placed on the experimental paradigms of EEG recording and the strategies employed for dataset splitting. By addressing these aspects, we can proactively prevent the overestimated decoding accuracy arising from EEG temporal autocorrelations.\n\nIt is worth noting that we do not want to create an illusion that all BCI works utilize EEG temporal autocorrelation features for decoding. In fact, there are many works that do not rely on EEG temporal autocorrelation features for decoding in image decoding  [48] ,  [49] ,  [50]  emotion recognition  [51] , sleep detection  [40] ,  [41]  and ASAD  [52] .

[8]  believed the model decodes by utilizing the baseline drift in the CVPR dataset. They found that when the EEG data is filtered with a bandpass filter, the decoding accuracy dropped greatly. Palazzo et al.\n\n[15] also claimed that temporal autocorrelation was strong only in low frequency. However, we have demonstrated in Appendix A.4 that the domain feature still exists and that high decoding accuracy can be achieved in any frequency band. In addition to baseline drift, some neuroscience researches have shown that temporal autocorrelation existed in neural oscillation, which could be reflected in EEG in various frequency bands. This is referred to as Long-Range Temporal Correlations (LRTC) in neuroscience research  [11] ,  [12] ,  [13] ,  [14] . Linkenkaer-Hansen et al.  [13]  first calculated the LRTC in resting-state EEG data. They found that spontaneous alpha, mu, and beta oscillations result in significant LRTC for at least several hundred seconds during resting conditions. Subsequent neuroscience research further demonstrated that significant LRTC exists in the theta  [11]  and gamma  [12]  bands. While baseline drift can be removed through filtering, the frequency range of the LRTC overlaps with the frequency range of stimuli-driven neural responses, making it impossible to remove this domain feature through filtering. Temporal correlation analysis on human EEG in the SparrKULee Dataset showed the existence of strong LRTC in all frequency bands, and the LRTC in a narrowband is sufficient to complete the corresponding decoding task.

This refers to using data from a subset of subjects for training, while data from the remaining subjects are used for testing.\n\nWithin the training data, there are two further data splitting strategies: leave-samples-out and leavesubjects-out. The former involves randomly dividing all samples of the training data into training and validation sets, whereas the latter uses data from a subset of subjects for the training set, with the remaining subjects data allocated for the validation set. Table  5  presents the decoding accuracy for six datasets (i.e., WM-CVPR, WM-DEAP, WM-KUL, SK-CVPR, SK-DEAP, and SK-KUL). It can be observed that when the leave-samples-out splitting strategy was used within the training data, both the training and validation sets achieved very high decoding accuracy, but the accuracy only reached the chance level on the test set. Such results are similar to those reported by  [46] ,  [8] ,  [47] , which corroborates the argument that while the leave-subjects-out approach may avert the domain features leakage, it cannot prevent overfitting of the domain features during the training stage, as discussed in Subsection 4.1. Moreover, when the leave-subjects-out data splitting strategy was used within the training dataset, the validation set performance was only at chance level despite high accuracy on the training set. This further demonstrates that decoding that relies on domain features cannot be generalized to practical application scenarios.\n\neach of their ten trials.  As demonstrated in Figure  5 , EEG data from both Watermelon and SparrKULee datasets show significant LRTC across multiple frequency bands. For the EEG data from the Watermelon dataset, significant bands of LRTC are primarily distributed in the low-frequency range (<8 Hz) and around 50 Hz, with these correlations spanning over 500 seconds. This indicates that baseline drifts and line noise contribute to the temporal correlation observed in the Watermelon dataset. For the EEG data from the SparrKULee dataset, LRTCs are significant across the entire frequency range. Similarly, LTRCs are most prominent at low frequencies (<5 Hz) and around 50 Hz, consistent with the findings from the Watermelon dataset. Notably, for SparrKULee dataset, there is also a significant presence of LTRC around 10 Hz, which aligns with previous research findings  [13] , suggesting the temporal correlation of alpha oscillations in human subjects.",
