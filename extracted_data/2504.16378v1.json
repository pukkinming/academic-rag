      "text": "\"Interoception is scientifically defined as the processing of internal bodily stimuli by the nervous system\"  [31] . In simpler terms, interoception is defined as \"the ability to be aware of internal sensations in the body, including heart rate, respiration, hunger, fullness, temperature, and pain, as well as emotion sensations\"  [57] . Recent advance in interoception's role in mental health have underscored its significance in conditions such as anxiety, mood disorders, disordered eating, addiction, and somatic symptom-related issues  [31] . In particular, the psychology community is currently actively measuring and using interoception data in their clinical studies, which has proven useful for understanding and improving mental health and other conditions  [31] .\n\nHowever, measuring interoception is difficult in our real-world daily computing lives as it requires access to many low-level bodily functions such as heart rate, respiration, temperature, etc. For example, measuring the heart rate or body temperature requires dedicated physiological sensors, which are not as common as ubiquitous mobile devices such as smartphones. Moreover, it is difficult and virtually not possible to conduct heart-beat-based measurement of interoception since existing methodologies (e.g., counting the number of heartbeats) typically require a controlled in-lab environment and are not suitable for the user's real-world live situations with various types of possible noise source for such physiological states.\n\nTo overcome such limitations, we present the first (to the best of our knowledge) attempt to find the existence of our novel hypothetical concept \"cyberoception.\" Cyberoception is defined as subjective sensory perception about the user's basic manipulation behavior with their commodity mobile computing devices such as smartphones, being measured through the embedded sensors in such devices, and acts as the same role as interoception in terms of its correlation with emotional ability (particularly the emotional experience in this study). In particular, we do not use any data or sensor that is not already being collected by the phone due to the user's regular phone usage patterns -we did this consciously to ensure that any solution we produced can be easily integrated into existing mobile apps and workflows.\n\nMore specifically, we focused on the basic operations in computing behavior where people access cyberspace by manipulating their smartphones throughout the day. The basic operations, such as unlocking the phone and turning on the phone, occur in their daily lives so often and so unconsciously that we hypothesized that such operations could be used as a target operation to question the user's subjective perception of the frequency. If we can discover a similar sense of interception, which can be measured only using the sensors embedded inside our commodity smartphones used daily, the mobile system, along with various types of applications and services, can obtain and utilize such status for their adaptive behaviors toward the realization of \"emotion-aware\" kind services. We see our cyberoception service as a key building block for many other apps that use the data to improve the health outcomes of mobile phone users.\n\nIn the rest of this paper, we first present more background information about the use of interoception data in the psychology community and then provide our design process to identify existing data sources that can be used to infer cyberoception. We conducted a hybrid experiment for 10 days, including a daily-life study and an in-lab emotional psychology experiment with 25 participants. Based on the detailed analysis of the data from 22 participants, we examined participants' perceptions of cyberspace activities, interoceptive abilities, and individual emotional traits. As the highlight of our findings, we found a correlation between a specific type of cyberoception, \"Turning On.\" and the experience of emotional valence.\n\nThe main contributions of this paper are:\n\n• We introduce the novel hypothetical sense of \"cyberoception, \" based on daily smartphone interactions. The concept is defined as having properties similar to interoception, particularly in its correlation with emotional experience. • We propose a methodology to measure cyberoception using embedded sensors in smartphones without requiring specialized physiological sensors or controlled laboratory environments. This approach enables continuous, non-invasive sensing in real-world settings. • Through a 10-day hybrid experiment, the study demonstrates for the first time that the specific cyberoception type \"Turning On\" is significantly correlated with participants' emotional valence.",

      "text": "interoception is defined as one's perception, and therefore awareness and understanding, of the physiological state of the body including changes therein  [9] . In more layman's terms, interoception is defined as \"the ability to be aware of internal sensations in the body, including heart rate, respiration, hunger, fullness, temperature, and pain, as well as emotion sensations\"  [57] .\n\nInteroception was first proposed by the British physiologist Charles Sherrington  [49] . Sherrington classified the senses based on the location of their receptors, categorize them into (1) interoception, (2) exteroception, and (3) proprioception. According to Sherrington, (1) interoception refers to the sense originating from the interoceptive surface, the internal surface of the body, while (2) exteroception is the sensation produced by receptors close to the body surface that are in direct contact with the external environment, including the following senses: sight, hearing, smell, and taste. Furthermore,  (3)  proprioception is the sensation produced by the movement of one's own body. The sensation of whether a body part is at rest or in motion is  (3)  proprioceptive sensation.\n\nMore recent research  [7]  discusses expanding Sherrington's original physiology-bound concept of interoception. Damasio  [10]  built on Sherrington's viewpoint that interoception forms the foundation of the sense of physical self but proposed that interoception should include proprioception, visceral perception, and the sense of the internal milieu (e.g., temperature and pain), distinguishing it from exteroception. A similar opinion is also supported by Craig  [9] . The latest researches use this revised definition  [8] .",

[59]  found a positive correlation between interoceptive error in a heartbeat discrimination task and the intensity of categorized emotional experiences. Katkin  [30]  reported that people who are accurate at interoception report greater distress in response to noxious stimulation. Barrett's experiment revealed that individuals with greater sensitivity to their heartbeats emphasized feelings of activation and deactivation when reporting their experiences of emotion over time more than those with lower sensitivity. \"  [2] . Moreover, the relationship between the interoceptive ability and the ability to recognize and respond to other person's emotion is confirmed. A study by  Terasawa et al.  showed a positive correlation between performance on a heartbeat counting task and the ability to recognize facial expressions of others  [52, 53] , suggesting a correlation between the interoceptive ability and the ability to recognize emotional experiences. Georgiou et al. reported that heartbeatsensitive individuals recognize others' facial expressions of sadness and fear better than individuals who are less sensitive  [16] . Imafuku et al. revealed that people with good interoception act more spontaneous facial mimicry than people with poor interoception  [25] .",

      "text": "Thus far, several experimental methodologies related to the state of human internal organs have been proposed to measure the interoception ability. Interoception is strongly related to the autonomic nervous system, which mainly unconsciously maintains homeostasis by the antagonistic function of the sympathetic and parasympathetic nervous systems. Thus, the various states of internal organs are controlled by these sympathetic and parasympathetic nerves.\n\nThe heartbeat counting is the most well-known method for measuring interoception. The \"heart rate counting task\" proposed by Schandry in 1981  [47] , in which the heart rate data (𝑁 𝑟𝑒𝑎𝑙 ) from an electrocardiogram (ECG) or pulse sensor is used as the ground truth. Simultaneously, the participant is asked to report their subjective answer on the heartbeat count (𝑁 𝑟𝑒𝑝𝑜𝑟𝑡 ) and not to touch any part of their body. The calculated error rate between 𝑁 𝑟𝑒𝑝𝑜𝑟𝑡 against 𝑁 𝑟𝑒𝑎𝑙 , shown in Equation  1 , is defined as \"Interoceptive Error\" and is often used as a metric to evaluate how accurate participant can count their heart rate. Since participants are required to provide subjective responses without physically touching their bodies, the Interoceptive Error effectively reflects their internal bodily awareness rather than relying on haptic sensations.\n\nThe visceral sensation is another well-known approach for measuring interoception. The visceral sensation is a type of sensation inside the body and is considered a typical interoception  [7] . Many methodologies were proposed to measure the interoception ability by measuring the accuracy of sensation to different viscera, including but not limited to gastric signals  [51, 55] , colon  [58]  and bladder  [27] .",

      "text": "However, the measurement of interoception statuses introduced above usually requires a well-controlled laboratory environment and physiological sensors since it is mainly based on a behavioral experiment of cardiac perception. For example, in the heart rate counting task introduced in the previous section, the participant's gesture (not to touch the body during counting), precise ECG sensor, and soundproof environment need to be appropriately controlled to achieve accurate measurement. Moreover, the instructor must be well-trained to explain the procedure clearly and in detail to ensure the participant can understand the procedure and do as required. Furthermore, even with the support from the instructor and the use of professional-grade accurate devices, we cannot avoid collecting some noises from the ECG sensor.\n\nIn contrast, daily computing involving various information services, such as social networking platforms, occurs not in wellcontrolled laboratory settings but in dynamic, \"wild\" environments. This computing takes place continuously throughout the day, from morning to night, amidst the noise and complexity of real-world conditions.\n\nDespite the importance of measuring interoception status to understand better the users' emotion-related abilities (e.g., how well the users can estimate each other's emotions), the existing methodologies do not match such computing environment in our real lives. In other words, when we aim to construct a system that measures the user's interoceptive ability continuously and repeatedly in such an environment, the aforementioned requirements of the existing methodologies are significant hurdles to the actual implementation.\n\n3 Related Work 3.1 Measurement Error in Self-Reported Smartphone Usage\n\nSeveral studies have highlighted a gap in users' self-reported smartphone usage and actual smartphone usage. This discrepancy inspired the experiment design of cyberoception, which aims to measure users' unconscious intuition about their smartphone habits. Focusing on communication-oriented smartphone usage, a previous study compared users' self-reports on the frequency of voice calls, SMS, and Gmail with actual logs  [33] . The users were found to subjectively overestimate the frequency of such voice calls, SMS, and Gmail. Although factors that contribute to overestimation remain unclear, this study argues that such measurement error is not random. However, multiple studies have shown that screen time tends to be subjectively underestimated  [11, 13, 39] . The mixed results of overestimation and underestimation suggest that we should analyze the various smartphone usage types separately rather than treating them uniformly.\n\nSeveral studies have endeavored to identify demographic factors that affect the individual measurement error of self-report in smartphone usage. However, the effects of gender, age, marital/nonmarital status, job, and educational status were found to be insignificant  [3, 50] . One critical oversight in these studies is the potential role of affective states in shaping individual perceptions of smartphone use.\n\nPrevious studies have collected self-reported data on smartphone usage at weekly or daily intervals. For our experiment, we decided to collect self-reports on smartphone usage every 30 minutes to estimate their intuition better.",

Numerous studies have mostly used data collected from smartphones to estimate users' emotions, mood, engagement, and physical health. Our study leverages smartphone data to ewxplore interoception, which is related to but different from concepts such as emotion and mood. An early work by LiKamwa  [37]  showed the feasibility of mood inference from patterns in application usage, phone calls, SMSs, emails, web browsing history, and location. This was expanded with a system called \"MoodScope\" which linked the self-reported mood of the user with their smartphone usage patterns.  [38]  Beyond basic emotions, \"MoodExplorer\" also examined smartphone usage patterns and sensing data to automatically detect compound emotion, defined as a combination of different basic emotions.  [62]  In addition, engagement with a task can also be inferred through the user's expression using acoustic sensing from a smartphone.  [28]  Other than estimating mental states, numerous studies have also measured physical health indicators such as heart rate variability and blood pressure using data from a smartphone's built-in accelerometer and camera  [24, 56]  There is growing evidence that the various data generated with smartphones can effectively reflect users' mental and physical states. As such, our study aims to explore the potential of using people's perception of smartphone usage can be used to assess interception.",

PAT is a novel smartphone-based method for assessing interoception by requiring participants to synchronize auditory tones with their heartbeats. In this task, tones are presented at a heart rate-matched frequency but deliberately out of phase with the heartbeats, and participants adjust the phase until they perceive synchrony. The method is robust against physiological or strategic confounds and demonstrates variability in performance across individuals.\n\nWhile PAT provides a novel method of measuring interception on the phone, it still relies on actual heartbeat data of the user sensed through a physiological sensor. Meanwhile, our research approach does not focus on directly measuring interception. Rather, we aim to explore new senses that can be measured through nonphysiological sensors.",

If we were to strictly adhere to measuring original interoceptive senses, we would ultimately need to measure internal bodily states, such as heart rate, by some means, thereby reverting the discussion to its initial scope.\n\nOn the other hand, looking at real-world computing in our daily life with widespread commodity mobile devices, we see our continuous interaction with these devices throughout our daily lives from morning to night. Heavy phone users carry and use their smartphones literally \"always\" throughout their lives, manipulating the phone interfaces and experiencing their interaction with the cyber world.\n\nRegarding this highly continuous and frequent smartphone usage, we consider the possibility that these operational manipulations have become, to some extent, \"unconscious behavior\" for us. (For instance, people may be unaware of how often they lock/unlock their smartphones in a single day, as this behavior is performed so frequently and unconsciously.)\n\nThus, when we think about their subjective \"sense\" around such almost-unconscious manipulation, we consider if such sense may have some similarity with the existing sense of interoception in terms of the correlation with the user's ability to regulate the emotion.",

The evolution of this series of discussions inspired us to discuss whether a further conceptual extension of interoception (including proprioception) was possible even to the cyber world.\n\nAs we review the related literature, we see that the flexibility and extendability of body schema have been extensively demonstrated in studies on the concept of the extended self  [22] . In this context, various tools and objects, including smartphones, have been investigated as extensions of the \"self\", with findings indicating effects comparable to those observed in the \"rubber hand illusion.\"  [36]  Notably, psychological research has consistently shown that smartphones (not limited to their usage but their existence itself) are perceived as an extension of the self  [17, 42] . Moreover, in recent research, interoception is revealed to be the core element of the cognitive process of self  [45] .\n\nBased on this discussion, we have reached the idea that we could possibly hypothesize that cyberoception can be treated as one type of interoception and that it can be inferred to share the emotionrelated properties  [10, 54]  similar to interoception. More concretely, since we are focusing on interoception's specific property in terms of the correlation against other emotional abilities (e.g., the ability to recognize and respond to other persons' emotions), we hypothesize that cyberoception holds such similar property.",

However, cyberoception leverages non-physiological data derived from daily interactions with mobile devices to estimate similar internal states. The measurement of cyberoception in this study is inspired by the typical gauge of interoception.\n\nAccording to the basic approach of cyberoception, which relies on the (non-physiological) available data on the user's mobile devices, the basic approach to estimating the user's states is based on the collection of (1) the data related to the user's device operation, along with (2) the user's subjective sense on such an operation.\n\nWhat specific sensations related to smartphones should we measure? After an extensive discussion among the research team, we selected the following six types of operations based on the following criteria: (1) they are operations and actions that users perform daily on their smartphones, and (2) they are extremely daily operations and actions, there is a considerable possibility that they are performed almost unconsciously.\n\ninteroception is closely tied to the autonomic nervous system, encompassing sensations such as heartbeat, respiration, and gastrointestinal activity, which are processed almost unconsciously. In proposing Cyberoception as a concept analogous to interoception, it is crucial to account for this characteristic of almost unconscious processing inherent in interoceptive sensations. Therefore, we adopted the criterion that operations and actions selected for Cyberoception metrics should be those that are extremely daily and thus likely to be performed almost unconsciously. Pragmatically, focusing on extremely daily operations makes Cyberoception measurable and feasible to study. These frequent and routine actions provide a practical foundation for collecting consistent data, enabling researchers to capture patterns of user behavior that reflect internal states without requiring invasive or burdensome methods.\n\nThe selected six types are (1) Turning On, (2) Unlocking, (3) Screen Use Duration, (4) Micro-usage, (5) Most-used App and (  6 ) Typo (Typographical Error).

The average duration of sessions with social networking applications is short  [14] , accounting for most of the sessions less than 5 s. However, it is infeasible to interpret all the sessions used for less than 5 s with only social networking app use.\n\nIn a study of 21 subjects, Ferreira et al. used 15 seconds as a boundary line in their analysis since nearly 50% of the collected sessions were less than 15 seconds long.

Generally, the user will correct Typo by pressing the backspace key or using the auto-correction feature.\n\nMany studies have estimated emotion from typing patterns, including mistyping on smartphones, and the number of backspace key presses (delete key) was entered into an emotion estimation model as representative of mistyping  [18] [19] [20] . The number of typographical error recorded by pressing the backspace key was a good representation of the user's emotional state. In this study, we sensed backspace key presses as the representation of Typo activity in participants' daily lives. However, auto-correction and predictive text features may affect the accuracy of the typographical error detection. To obtain data that closely reflects users' daily smartphone usage, we refrained from giving any instructions that could alter their daily typing habits. Furthermore, participants' Typo activities were detected more precisely though non-daily in-lab experiment.\n\nIn this study, we developed an application that counts and records the number of presses of the delete key, and collected data on the number of Typo (Typographical Errors).",

In the Daily Cyberoception Measuring Survey, as shown in Figure  3 , we used the experience sampling method (ESM). The trends of smartphone usage vary widely throughout the day  [1] , and it is necessary to collect usage data from different time periods. In addition, we utilized a randomized ESM method that randomizes the timing of each survey transmission  [46]  in a specific time window rather than specific fixed transmission timings (noon, 2:00p.m. etc.). We send five notifications to subjects throughout the day and collect their responses to the cyberoception metrics. Each notification is sent during five-time windows: 7:00~10:00, 10:00~13:00, 13:00~16:00, 16:00~19:00, and 19:00~22:00. The specific transmission time in each window is determined randomly, by delaying the actual delivery for a random period. To measure cyberoception as a perception, we ask participants to report their subjective intuition. Furthermore, we set the duration of each sampling session to be as short as 30 minutes immediately before answering the survey form.\n\nTo prevent participants from easily guessing the next survey questions, three of the five Cyberoception Metrics were randomly extracted for each survey form by shuffling with the Fisher-Yates algorithm  [12] .",

Participants were asked to rate their smartphone usage subjectively and qualitatively by responding to a Likert scale of 1 to 5 for smartphone usage during a 30-minute session.\n\nFor instance, as the measure of participants' cyberoception on Unlocking, participants will receive a questionnaire as below:\n\nBased on your daily experience with your smartphone use, during the period from 30 minutes ago to the present time, what do you think about your smartphone unlocking while using this smartphone? Please answer based on your own perception/feeling, and do not dwell on your answer. Participants can choose one item from 1 to 5, where option \"1\" represents \"No Unlocking\" and option \"5\" represents \"Most Ever\".\n\nAll detailed questions of the survey are listed in the Appendix A.\n\nParticipants with good cyberoception can specify the level of their smartphone usage, which means that the ascending level should correspond to usage sensing data in ascending order.

      "text": "This study introduces the concept of cyberoception, which can be an alternative to interoception as a factor of emotional ability. For the concrete operations representing Cyberoception, we proposed six types of Cyberoception metrics. Through a ten-day daily-life study and in-lab emotional psychology experiment, we analyzed participants' perception of activities in cyberspace, specifically via their smartphones, interoceptive ability, and emotional individual characteristics. As the answer of RQ1, we revealed that the \"Turn On\" cyberoception metrics can function similarly to interoception, performing as an affective factor that is intimately connected to an individual's emotional experience The result evidentiary supports the correlation between cyberoception and experience of emotional valence. However, As the answer of RQ2, though cyberoception was hypothesized as a replacement for interoception measurement, the experimental result rejected such a hypothesis and discriminated between cyberoception and interoception measurement.\n\nAlthough the experimental result did not support cyberoception to replace interoception measurement, it is a valuable discovery that implies the unique characteristics that our proposed concept \"cyberoception\" holds.\n\nOne explanation for our result is that cyberoception, referring to the sense of the condition within cyberspace and parallels interoception, is crucial in users' personality traits on core affect and composes users' emotional experience. Future research explores the connection between cyberoception and varied emotions in users' daily lives, including long-term mood and short-term affective response.\n\nIn previous literature  [2, 59] , valence was demonstrated to be less related to interoception. Our findings of the correlation between the Cyberoceptive Error of Turning On and valence imply that cyberoception is connected to users' emotional experience through a different approach. Therefore, cyberoception can eliminate the blind point of interoception studies and provide a futuristic point of view toward users' affective states.\n\nInteroception is a unified sensation for each viscera, and it has been shown that visceral sensation to the stomach is consistent with that to the heart  [23] . In our study, we found a positive correlation among Cyberoception metrics. Although not statistically significant, such a positive correlation could imply a common nature among different Cyberoception metrics, which warrants further investigation. Cyberoception should be positioned as a meta concept that includes multiple perceptions towards activities and conditions within cyberspace.\n\nCyberoception employs usage data obtained from a user's daily smartphone activities, without any additional biometric sensors or well-controlled experimental environment. Thus, cyberoception enables real-time and non-invasive monitoring of user's emotional characteristics. Cyberoception, as a building block in other applications (such as a linked library), middleware, and even the operating system, contributes to understanding the affective context of users and providing more human-centered information services.\n\nIn \"measurement error in self-reported smartphone usage, \" previous studies have consistently highlighted discrepancies between self-reported smartphone usage and actual usage  [11, 13, 39] . While these studies have shown that measurement errors are non-random, the factors underlying these discrepancies remain underexplored. Most notably, demographic factors such as sex, age, marital status, and educational background have demonstrated limited or insignificant effects  [3, 50] . By shifting the focus to affective states, this study uncovers a previously overlooked dimension, emphasizing the importance of emotional valence in shaping individuals' perceptions of their smartphone use.",

      "section_name": "Limitation And Future Work",
      "text": "There are limitations in this study, which leaves room for further research. In this study, we recruited participants from a university where many participants were underage (< 21). Therefore, the stimulus we showed them was strictly limited. We avoided using erotic, violent, or grotesque pictures, which made the sampled pictures from IAPS tend to lean more toward a low-arousing distribution.\n\nSince the participants were all university students, the inference of our experimental results is limited to the younger age group. Since it is common for interoception to decline with age  [32] , our participants had better interoceptive ability than Schandry's study  [47] . This biased age distribution can explain the difficulty encountered when investigating the relationship between interoception and other factors. Conducting experiments with all age groups would be essential for future work.\n\nThis study focuses only on the cardiac axes of interoception. Considering that much is still unknown about interoception, further research is required across other modalities, such as respiratory, gastric, colonic, and rectal axes.\n\nAs it is challenging to fully understand emotions based solely on the physiological-based interoception, it is similarly difficult to comprehensively explain emotions independently through cyberoception. The relationship between cyberoception and emotions demonstrated in this study represents only a partial aspect of the broader emotional experience. Further work is required in this area.\n\nWe conducted trials randomly orders within each in-lab experiment and forced adequate breaks between experiments. There is hardly any possibility of learning effects among the Affective Picture Rating Experiment, Interoception Experiment, and Typing Experiment because they are different tasks that follow distinctly different procedures. Future works could include investigating the effect of the mentioned in-lab experiments.\n\nOne might argue that the method used in this experiment, which requires self-reporting every half hour, is not as non-invasive as measuring interoceptive sensation, which measures heart rate using a camera in daily or weekly intervals. However, in the experiment in this paper, asking the subjects to self-report with such interval was one particular setting in the experiment to discover whether there was a correlation, given that it is still unknown how much each specific cyberoception metric correlates with emotional experience and interoception. After cyberoception is discovered because of this research, it may be more effective to use a time interval other than 30 minutes for this sensation. Discovering a more effective time interval is outside the scope of this paper itself and can be considered in future.\n\nOne notable limitation of this study, is the potential maladaptive consequences of heightened awareness of feelings. While this research aims to improve understanding of Cyberoception, psychology research suggests that consistently encouraging individuals to become acutely aware of their feelings can have unintended negative effects  [41] . Furthermore, the coping techniques involving smartphone usage should be developed in future studies.\n\nIn addition, there are potential risks associated with viewing smartphones as extensions of the body, a concept explored in this study. Excessive smartphone use is likely to intensify the phenomenon of the smartphone being perceived as an extension of the self, which may harm users' well-being. Given the widespread use of smartphones in contemporary society, there is an urgent need to accelerate research on the implications and dynamics of the \"smartphone as an extension of the self. \" In this context, research on cyberoception becomes crucial, and further studies are essential.",

      "text": "In this study, we introduced the concept of cyberoception, which is expected to replace interoception as a factor of emotional ability. Through a 10-day daily-life study and an in-lab emotional psychology experiment, we analyzed 22 participants' perceptions of activities in cyberspace, interoceptive ability, and individual emotional characteristics. The result evidentiary support the correlation between the experience of emotional valence and a specific Cyberoception, \"Turning On\". Cyberoception can eliminate the blind point of interoception studies and provide a futuristic point of view toward users' affective states. We treat cyberoception as a key building block for many other apps that use the data to improve the health outcomes of mobile phone users.",
