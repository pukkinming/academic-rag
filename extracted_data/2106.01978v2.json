      "text": "Emotion recognition in conversation (ERC) aims to detect emotions expressed by the speakers in each utterance of the conversation. The task is an important topic for developing empathetic machines  (Zhou et al., 2020)  in a variety of areas including social opinion mining  (Kumar et al., 2015) , intelligent assistant  (König et al., 2016) , health care  (Pujol et al., 2019) , and so on.\n\nA conversation often contains contextual clues  (Poria et al., 2019)  that trigger the current utterance's emotion, such as the cause or situation. Recent context-based works  (Poria et al., 2017; Hazarika et al., 2018b; Majumder et al., 2019)  on ERC have been devoted to perceiving situation-level or speaker-level context by deep learning models. However, these methods are insufficient in understanding the context that usually contains rich emotional clues. We argue they mainly suffer from the following challenges. 1) The extraction of emotional clues. Most approaches  (Hazarika et al., 2018a,b; Jiao et al., 2020b)  generally retrieve the relevant context from a static memory, which limits the ability to capture richer emotional clues. 2) The integration of emotional clues. Many works  (Majumder et al., 2019; Ghosal et al., 2019; Lu et al., 2020)  usually use the attention mechanism to integrate encoded emotional clues, ignoring their intrinsic semantic order. It would lose logical relationships between clues, making it difficult to capture key factors that trigger emotions.\n\nThe Cognitive Theory of Emotion  (Schachter and Singer, 1962; Scherer et al., 2001)  suggests that cognitive factors are potently determined for the formation of emotional states. These cognitive factors can be captured by iteratively performing the intuitive retrieving process and conscious reasoning process in our brains  (Evans, 1984 (Evans, , 2003 (Evans, , 2008;; Sloman, 1996) . Motivated by them, this paper attempts to model both critical processes to reason emotional clues and sufficiently understand the conversational context. By following the mechanism of working memory  (Baddeley, 1992)  in the cognitive phase, we can iteratively perform both cognitive processes to guide the extraction and integration of emotional clues, which imitates human unique cognitive thinking.\n\nIn this work, we propose novel Contextual Reasoning Networks (DialogueCRN) to recognize the utterance's emotion by sufficiently understanding the conversational context. The model introduces a cognitive phase to extract and integrate emotional clues from the context retrieved by the perceive phase. Firstly, in the perceptive phase, we leverage Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) (Hochreiter and Schmidhuber, 1997) networks to capture situation-level and speaker-level context. Based on the above context, global memories can be obtained to storage different contextual information. Sec-ondly, in the cognitive phase, we design multi-turn reasoning modules to iteratively extract and integrate the emotional clues. The reasoning module performs two processes, i.e., an intuitive retrieving process and a conscious reasoning process. The former utilizes the attention mechanism to match relevant contextual clues by retrieving static global memories, which imitates the intuitive retrieving process. The latter adopts LSTM networks to learn intrinsic logical order and integrate contextual clues by retaining and updating dynamic working memory, which imitates the conscious reasoning process. It is slower but with human-unique rationality  (Baddeley, 1992) . Finally, according to the above contextual clues at situation-level and speaker-level, an emotion classifier is used to predict the emotion label of the utterance.\n\nTo evaluate the performance of the proposed model, we conduct extensive experiments on three public benchmark datasets, i.e., IEMOCAP, SE-MAINE and MELD datasets. Results consistently demonstrate that our proposed model significantly outperforms comparison methods. Moreover, understanding emotional clues from a cognitive perspective can boost the performance of emotion recognition.\n\nThe main contributions of this work are summarized as follows:\n\n• We propose novel Contextual Reasoning Networks (DialogueCRN) to fully understand the conversational context from a cognitive perspective. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first attempt to explore cognitive factors for emotion recognition in conversations.\n\n• We design multi-turn reasoning modules to extract and integrate emotional clues by iteratively performing the intuitive retrieving process and conscious reasoning process, which imitates human unique cognitive thinking.\n\n• We conduct extensive experiments on three public benchmark datasets. The results consistently demonstrate the effectiveness and superiority of the proposed model 1  .",

The architecture of a reasoning module is depicted in Figure  2 .\n\nThe reasoning module performs two processes, the intuitive retrieving process, and the conscious reasoning process.

Different modules that model the situation-level and speaker-level context in both perceptive and cognitive phases are removed separately. The results are shown in Table 5. When cognition and perception modules are removed successively, the performance is greatly     5 , the performance on the IEMOCAP dataset decreases 4.3%, 4.3% and 6.5% in terms of Acc., Weighted-F1, and Macro-F1, respectively. And on the SEMAINE dataset, the MAE scores of Valence, Arousal, and Expectancy attributes are increased by 2.3%, 12.5% and 2.9%, respectively. These results indicate the efficacy of the cognitive phase, which can reason based on the perceived contextual information consciously and sequentially. Besides, if removing the cognitive phase for either speaker-level or situation-level context, as shown in the second block, the results decreased on both datasets. The fact reflects both situational factors and speaker factors are critical in the cognitive phase.\n\nEffect of Perceptive Phase. As shown in the last row, when removing the perception module, the performance is dropped sharply. The inferior results reveal the necessity of the perceptive phase to unconsciously match relevant context based on the current utterance.\n\nEffect of Different Context. When removing either situation-level or speaker-level context in both cognitive and perceptive phases, respectively, the performance has a certain degree of decline. The phenomenon shows both situation-level and speaker-level context play an effective role in the perceptive and cognitive phases. Besides, the margin of dropped performance is different on both datasets. This suggests speaker-level context plays a greater role in the perception phase while more complex situation-level context works well in the cognitive phase. The explanation is that it is limited to learn informative features from context by intuitive matching perception, but conscious cognitive reasoning can boost better understanding.",
