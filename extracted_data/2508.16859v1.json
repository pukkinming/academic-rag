In the realm of psychology, these models hold promise for a deeper understanding of human emotions and behaviors. However, recent research primarily focuses on enhancing their emotion recognition abilities, leaving the substantial potential in emotion reasoning, which is crucial for improving the naturalness and effectiveness of human-machine interactions. Therefore, in this paper, we introduce a multi-turn multimodal emotion understanding and reasoning (MTMEUR) benchmark, which encompasses 1,451 video data from real-life scenarios, along with 5,101 progressive questions. These questions cover various aspects, including emotion recognition, potential causes of emotions, future action prediction, etc. Besides, we propose a multi-agent framework, where each agent specializes in a specific aspect, such as background context, character dynamics, and event details, to improve the system's reasoning capabilities.

      "text": "In recent years, multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have shown significant advancements across diverse fields due to their enhanced capabilities in multimodal understanding and reasoning  [21, 29] . One of the ultimate goal of MLLMs is to improve humanmachine interactions, enabling more seamless and intuitive communication. Central to achieving this goal is the development of multimodal emotion understanding and reasoning, as a deeper understanding of human emotions allows for responses that are more adaptive and acceptable to users. Therefore, modeling and evaluating emotional and psychological states have drawn substantial attention in recent years, and many studies have been proposed in this area  [9, 12, 33, 37, 44] . For example, the CMU-MOSI dataset  [59]  provided video segments of utterances annotated for sentiment polarity and intensity, enabling researchers to assess model performance in multimodal sentiment analysis. Furthermore, the MELD dataset  [35]  offered video clips of multi-party conversations annotated with six different emotions, enabling researchers to evaluate model performance in emotion recognition. Moreover, the Social-IQ  [58]  provided a resource for assessing social intelligence through question-answering tasks, enabling researchers to gauge model performance in understanding social and emotion cues. MEmoR  [38]  introduced a multimodal emotion recognition dataset that integrates a reasoning process, leveraging supporting evidence to better recognize emotion.\n\nAlthough these approaches have brought significant improvements, several issues cannot be appropriately considered. First, most existing studies emphasize assessing sentiment intensity, polarity, and emotion types  [10, 50] . However, they still fall short in capturing the complexity of emotion interactions and do not sufficiently explore the evolving relationships and transitions between",

Second, most benchmarks lack detailed exploration of emotion-specific aspects, resulting in limitations in both scope and depth  [38] . For example, as shown in Figure  1 , identifying potential causes of emotions or predicting future human responses within the video context is essential for a more comprehensive understanding of emotional and psychological states, while such elements are overlooked in datasets such as Social-IQ and Social-IQ2.\n\nTherefore, in this paper, we introduce a multi-turn multimodal emotion understanding and reasoning (MTMEUR) benchmark, which consists of 1,451 carefully curated videos that cover a wide range of complex scenarios, along with 5,101 high-quality progressive questions, including emotion recognition, potential causes of emotions, future action prediction, etc. Methodologically, we propose a novel multi-agent-based approach to improve the emotion reasoning capabilities of MLLMs by efficiently extracting and integrating distinct aspects of information. This framework consists of four specialized agents, each concentrating on a unique aspect: background context, character dynamics, event details, and decision-making processes. Furthermore, we evaluate several state-of-the-art (SOTA) MLLMs and the proposed method on MTMEUR dataset, with accuracy ranging from 29.10% (Videochatgpt) to 71.19% (Qwen2-VL). The experimental results also show that the proposed method is beneficial to improving emotion reasoning ability. Our code is released at https://github.com/MindIntLab-HFUT/MTMEUR.",

      "text": "Natural Language Processing (NLP) methodologies have been extensively applied across diverse domains, encompassing tasks such as text summarization, information extraction, and text classification  [14-16, 25, 28] . Large Language models have revolutionized NLP tasks, achieving success across a broad spectrum of applications  [11, 13, 23, 24] . Foundational architectures like Transformer  [45]  and training paradigms like instruction tuning  [47]  have enabled models such as PaLM  [8] , and LLaMA  [43]  to demonstrate remarkable language understanding capabilities. Building upon these textual foundations, the emergence of MLLMs has extended these capabilities to visual domains. The debut of GPT-4 (Vision) has attracted significant attention due to its groundbreaking multimodal understanding capabilities. This success has sparked a wave of research into MLLMs. Early research in this area primarily focused on image-text understanding tasks  [20, 55, 61, 62] . LLaVA  [27]  and MiniGPT-4  [64] , where image encoders were utilized to extract visual features and were then aligned with LLM-based encoders for further processing. These models have paved the way for new approaches to multimodal content understanding and generation. As research has progressed, some models have begun to incorporate video modalities, exploring the vast potential of large models in video understanding. VideoChat  [22]  integrated video foundation models and LLM via a learnable neural interface. Furthermore, Video-ChatGPT  [30]  used CLIP  [36]  to extract spatial and temporal features from videos, which are then integrated into LLM to enhance understanding and generating detailed conversations.",

      "text": "In recent years, researchers have made significant progress in the field of emotion understanding, including emotion recognition  [1] , emotional video captioning  [39] [40] [41]  and so on. Many benchmarks have been proposed to evaluate the model performance in terms of emotion recognition  [52, 54] . For instance, CMU-MOSI  [59] , CMU-MOSEAS  [57] , and Youtube  [32]  integrated text, and video modalities, and offered basic emotion annotations, which focused on predicting sentiment polarity and intensity within videos. Furthermore, MELD  [35] , MuSe-CaR  [42] , and IEMOCAP  [4]  contained videos of multi-party conversations, which further incorporated the context of interactions. CMU-MOSEI  [60]  consists of numerous YouTube video clips, each containing at least one recognized emotion, further enriching the multimodal emotion analysis. In addition, some recent studies  [49, 58]  focus on measuring emotion cognition and intelligence within social contexts through question answering. Compared to existing benchmarks, the proposed MTMEUR focuses on the reasoning of characters in a video. This task demands not only an advanced understanding of the visual and contextual elements within the video, but also necessitates the integration of sophisticated common sense knowledge. MTMEUR challenges the model to simulate human-like responses within specific emotion contexts and scenarios, offering a better evaluation of its emotion reasoning and cognitive abilities.",

Specifically, four reviewers perform an initial evaluation of the video content, aiming to select videos that not only display a single emotion change but also demonstrate emotion interactions within specific contexts. Additionally, we consider the diversity of the video backgrounds to ensure that the context provided ample information. This process also take into account the emotion expressiveness of the video, visual quality, and the effectiveness of background elements. During the screening process, each reviewer is asked to rate the videos on a scale of 1 to 5, quantifying their evaluation results.

To tackle this challenge, we developed a unified and automated process to generate high-quality data associated with the videos.\n\nIn the first step, we select a subset of pre-filtered seed tasks from Social-IQ  [58]  and further supplement them with 75 manually constructed examples. These high-quality examples cover diverse emotional reasoning types and serve as few-shot examples to guide GPT-4o to produce better question-answer pairs. For each video, we randomly sample six tasks from the seed pool and input both video and chosen tasks to GPT-4o to generate two more complex questions. This method allows us to efficiently generate progressive questions for each video during the initial phase. These questions cover not only common topics, ranging from fundamental areas like emotion recognition and the triggers of emotion responses, to openended inquiries that require reasoning. For instance, some questions explore the potential outcomes of a situation or ask for suggestions based on specific contexts. We generate both the correct option and several distracting options for each question, ensuring that each question has four distinct choices. These distractor options are carefully designed to resemble the correct answers in surface form while differing conceptually or even being opposites, thereby enhancing their ability to mislead.",

      "text": "In the first phase of data generation, the generated questions and answers may be relatively simple for MLLMs to understand and answer, and the style of the data remains quite similar to the initial seed data. Motivated by instruction evolution that enhanced instructions can empower LLM better alignment with human preference  [53] , we introduce an iterative refinement mechanism aimed at improving the complexity and diversity of the initial question set. By utilizing specially designed prompts, we gradually increase the complexity and diversity of the generated questions, making them more aligned with real-world emotion reasoning scenarios. Specifically, our iterative mechanism enhances the questions and answers from multiple dimensions, progressively elevating their sophistication to better simulate the complex challenges found in real emotion reasoning tasks. Additionally, during evolution, a filtering mechanism evaluates the evolved data, re-evolving any that fails to meet standards. Question Evolution. We evolve the questions in the following aspects. For complexity, we introduce multiple reasoning steps and add constraints based on the specific contexts within the video scenes. These constraints not only require the model to identify basic emotions but also to understand the complex relationships and causal links between emotions and their contexts. For example, while an initial question might simply ask about a single emotion, after several iterations, the question may require the model to handle the interplay of multiple emotions during the reasoning process. For diversity, we design prompts that guide the model to create coherent and diverse questions across various contexts. Through multi-turn interactions, these questions explore how emotions evolve at different stages and their impact on other characters within the scenes. In addition to complexity and diversity, we also focus on fine-grained emotion reasoning, emphasizing the subtle dynamics of emotion shifts. The emotions depicted in videos are often complex and multi-dimensional, with multiple emotions sometimes overlapping. To address this, our prompts are designed to guide the model in capturing these subtle emotion changes, ensuring that the generated questions delve deeply into the interaction between emotions.\n\nAnswer Evolution. In addition to question evolution, we further optimize the answers to encompass more contextual information and enhance the reasoning requirements of the options from two aspects. To increase the depth of the options, we first introduce more constraints by adding qualifiers and modifiers to make the description more specific. Besides, the evolution process involve integrating secondary conditions or details that are closely related to the question context, including emotion shifts in the character, subtle behaviors, and video details. For example, the original option might be \"The character feels angry due to a friend's misunderstanding. \" With increased reasoning depth, the option could be revised to \"The character feels angry due to a friend's misunderstanding but displays coldness and distrust when the friend attempts to explain. \" These steps refine the language to better match the context of the video, necessitating a deeper understanding from the model to accurately differentiate between the correct and distractor options.",

A higher quality score reflects responses that accurately convey emotion cues while maintaining coherence and clarity in expression. We multiplied the complexity and quality scores to obtain a composite score for each question. We ranked all questions for the same video based on their composite scores and selected the highest-scoring questions as the final retained questions for that video.

Reviewers assess the question-answer pair based on the following three dimensions to ensure they meet the expected standards:  We filter out any data that failed to meet the first criterion (i.e., correctness). Besides, each question is independently evaluated by at least two reviewers in terms of complexity and quality, with each dimension scored on a scale of 1 to 5. The final score for each question is the average of the two reviewers' scores. If the score difference between the two reviewers exceed a certain threshold (i.e., more than 2 points), the question is sent to a third reviewer for arbitration. After scoring, the questions are ranked based on their total scores, and only those exceeding a minimum threshold (i.e., 3) are retained in the dataset. To ensure the reliability of the manual review process, we assess the level of consistency among these reviewers. Before the formal manual review, we randomly selected 100 examples and calculate Fleiss' Kappa between reviewers, which yielded a value exceeding 0.81. This high Kappa score indicates strong agreement among reviewers, demonstrating the effectiveness and reliability of the manual review process.\n\nTo further validate the question solvability, we conducted an additional human evaluation with new volunteers who had not participated in the original annotation process.
