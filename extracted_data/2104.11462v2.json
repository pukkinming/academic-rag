      "text": "Self-Supervised Learning (SSL) using huge unlabeled data has been successfully explored for image and natural language processing. Recent works also investigated SSL from speech. They were notably successful to improve performance on downstream tasks such as automatic speech recognition (ASR). While these works suggest it is possible to reduce dependence on labeled data for building efficient speech systems, their evaluation was mostly made on ASR and using multiple and heterogeneous experimental settings (most of them for English). This questions the objective comparison of SSL approaches and the evaluation of their impact on building speech systems. In this paper, we propose LeBenchmark: a reproducible framework for assessing SSL from speech. It not only includes ASR (high and low resource) tasks but also spoken language understanding, speech translation and emotion recognition. We also focus on speech technologies in a language different than English: French. SSL models of different sizes are trained from carefully sourced and documented datasets. Experiments show that SSL is beneficial for most but not all tasks which confirms the need for exhaustive and reliable benchmarks to evaluate its real impact. LeBenchmark is shared with the scientific community for reproducible research in SSL from speech.",

      "text": "Self-Supervised Learning (SSL) based on huge unlabeled data has been explored successfuly for image processing  [1, 2]  and Natural Language Processing (NLP)  [3] . Recently, pioneering work investigated SSL from speech, and successfully improved performance on downstream tasks such as speech recognition in low-resource scenarios  [4, 5] . One observation that can be made about those recent studies on SSL for speech is that, as common benchmarks are not experimented, comparison of different SSL approaches are difficult to make. In addition, contributions have mostly been done on English, with a few recent studies related to multilingual SSL  [6, 7] . We propose to remedy these shortcomings by providing a reproducible benchmark 1 that includes:\n\n• a large and heterogeneous collection of French speech utterances (read, prepared, and spontaneous);\n\n• pre-trained SSL models learnt on collections of 1k and 3k hours of French speech;\n\n1 https://github.com/LeBenchmark/\n\n• assessments on Speech Recognition (ASR), Spoken Language Understanding (SLU), Speech Translation (AST) and Emotion Recognition (AER) in French.",

      "text": "Most deep learning methods highly rely on large quantities of labeled training data. Particularly, current acoustic models require thousands of hours of transcribed speech to achieve stateof-the-art performance. However, this requirement cannot be fullfiled by the majority of the nearly 7,000 languages spoken worldwide. To overcome this, SSL has been recently proposed as an interesting alternative for data representation learning, as it requires less or no annotated data. Such learnt representations have been very successful in vision  [1, 2]  and NLP  [3, 22] . Selfsupervised learning from speech consists of resolving pseudotasks, which do not require human annotation, as a pre-training for the real tasks to solve. These pseudo-tasks target predicting the next samples, or solving ordering problems. For instance, Autoregressive Predictive Coding (APC) considers the sequential structure of speech and predicts information about a future frame  [23, 24] , whereas Contrastive Predictive Coding (CPC) distinguishes a future speech frame from distractor samples  [4, 25] , which is an easier learning objective compared to APC. Such representations have been shown to improve performance in several speech tasks  [26] , while being less sensitive to domain and/or language mismatch  [5] . It has also been shown that features extracted through a CPC pre-training can be transfered to other languages, with performance being on par or superior to a supervised pre-training  [27] .",

      "text": "Recently, large multilingual corpora that include French have been made available, such as MLS  [17]  (1,096 h), or voxpopuli  [7]  (+4,500 h). However, these are restricted to either read or well-prepared speech, failing to provide diversity in the speech samples, such as accented, spontaneous and/or affective speech. As a consequence, SSL models trained only on these corpora may present poor generalisation abilities on spontaneous or affective speech. In this work, we gathered a large variety of speech corpora in French that cover different accents (MLS, African Accented Speech, CaFE), acted emotions (GEMEP, CaFE, Att-Hack), telephone dialogues (PORT-MEDIA), read (MLS, African Accented French) and sponta-   1 ). We detail below the necessary steps for producing the dataset whose statistics are reported in Table  1 .\n\nPre-processing for SSL training Audio recordings were segmented using time stamps from speech transcriptions. We also retrieved, when available, speaker labels and gender information. Following  [28] , we removed utterances shorter than 1 s, and longer than 30 s. Finally, when necessary, audio segments were converted to mono PCM files using 16 bits and a sampling frequency of 16 kHz.\n\nFinal dataset To the best of our knowledge, this is the very first study that explores such a diverse and large ensemble of datasets for SSL training. It includes 2,933 h of speech, from which 1,115 h is read speech, 1,626 h broadcast speech, 124 h spontaneous speech, 38 h acted telephone dialogues, and 29 h acted emotional speech. Regarding gender, we collected 1,824 h of speech from male speakers, 1,034 h from female speakers, and 74 h from unknown gender. This full corpus is refered as medium, and the subset made of MLS only is refered as small.",

Following  [28] , two different Wav2Vec2.0 architectures (large and base) are coupled with our small (S) and medium (M) corpus to form our set of Wav2Vec2.0 models: W2V2-Fr-S-base, W2V2-Fr-S-large, W2V2-Fr-M-base, W2V2-Fr-M-large. Hyperparameters and architectures for base and large are identical to the ones first introduced in  [28] . All models are trained on four Nvidia Tesla V100 (32GB) until the loss observed on the validation set of the MLS corpus (Section 3) reaches a stable point. Pretrained Wav2Vec2.0 models are shared with the community via HuggingFace 2  for further integration with well-known toolkits such as Fairseq  [29] , SpeechBrain  [30]  or Kaldi  [31] .

Hybrid DNN-HMM The baseline acoustic models (AM) have been trained on 40-dimensional high-resolution (hires) MFCC features using the Kaldi  [31]  toolkit with a state-of-the-art factorized time delay neural network (TDNN-F)  [34, 35]  on the ETAPE training corpus  [33]  only. The model has 12 TDNN-F layers (1,024-dimensional, with projection dimension of 128) and a 3,432-dimensional output layer. It was trained using lattice-free maximum mutual information (LF-MMI)  [36]  and cross-entropy criteria. Speed and volume perturbations have been applied for data augmentation. We used a similar topology to train three other systems with different types of input features extracted by W2V2-Fr-M-large, W2V2-En-large  [28] , and XLSR-53-large models. 100-dimensional speaker i-vectors were appended to the input features for all the models.

      "text": "The WER results on the ETAPE development and test data sets for the hybrid DNN-HMM models are given in Table  2 . Among the models trained on SSL features, two models provide improvement over the baseline AM trained on MFCC features: the model trained on XLSR-53 features (7-8% of relative WER reduction) and the model trained on W2V2-Fr-M-large features (17-20% of relative WER reduction). To our knowledge, this is the first time SSL features are used for hybrid DNN-HMM ASR. Actually, the hybrid DNN-HMM ASR system is much better than its end-to-end counterpart on ETAPE (see next paragraph). This is partly due to the use of speaker adaptation (ivectors) and hand-crafted pronunciation dictionary which might be particularly beneficial to the hybrid DNN-HMM system, compared to end-to-end ASR, for the low resource ETAPE task. Table  3  presents the results achieved with end-to-end ASR on Common Voice 6.1 and on ETAPE datasets. On the ETAPE, filterbank parameters (MFB) got significanly the best results, while on Common Voice, W2V2-Fr-M-large is very close. In all (hybrid and end-to-end) ASR experiments, among the wav2vec models, W2V2-Fr-M-large got the best results.",

      "text": "Dataset The MEDIA corpus  [38, 39]  is used for the French SLU benchmark. The corpus is made up of 12,908 utterances (41.5 h) for training, 1,259 utterances (3.5 h) for development and 3,005 utterances (11.3 h) for test. Model Our end-to-end model has a pyramidal LSTM encoder similar to  [40] . The decoder integrates, in addition to the usual attention mechanism for attending the encoder hidden states, an attention mechanism for attending all previous decoder prediction's embeddings, instead of just the previous one  [41] . We use an incremental training strategy similar to  [39] , by first training an ASR model from scratch which is used to initialize parameters of a SLU model using a simple linear layer as decoder; and then using this simple SLU to initialize parameters of our final SLU model, which uses a LSTM decoder. The model, which is implemented using Fairseq  [29] , has the same settings as  [39]  to allow direct and fair comparison.\n\nResults for ASR and SLU obtained with different speech representations are shown in Table  4 , and they are given in terms of Word Error Rate (WER) and Concept Error Rate (CER) respectively, which is computed the same way as WER but on concept sequences. The ASR results are included because we use tokenlevel models (ASR) to pre-initialize SLU models. The ⊕ symbol is used for separating Encoder and Decoder names: Kheops is the pyramidal encoder inspired from  [40] , Basic is the linear decoder, and LSTM is the more advanced LSTM decoder. For ASR, using SSL features as input resulted in an impressive drop in WER, even when using English SSL models. At best, we achieve a WER of 11.77% on the development data with the W2V2-Fr-M-large features. SLU results (SLU decoding in Table 4) follow the same trend. The best performance is obtained again with W2V2-Fr-M-large features, with a CER of 18.54 on the development data. This result improves previous work by almost 5 points (23.39 vs. 18.54), and stands as the new stateof-the-art result using only MEDIA training data for learning SLU models. Better results have been obtained in  [42, 43]  by using more transcribed and annotated data, in addition to the MEDIA corpus, via transfer learning.",

In this work, we are interested in translating from French to another language. Datasets We selected subsets having French as the source language in two large multilingual speech corpora: CoVoST-2  [44]  and multilingual TEDx  [45] . Our benchmark covers translation directions from French to three target languages, English (en), Portugese (pt), and Spanish (es), with following training sizes: 50 h (TEDx/en), 38 h (TEDx/es), 25 h (TEDx/pt), and 180 h (CoVoST2/en).\n\nFeatures We compared models using 80-dimensional MFB features and SSL representations. In addition to the four French Wav2Vec2.0 models trained in Section 4, we also considered the following off-the-shelf models: English  [28]  (W2V2-En-base/large), French  [7]  (W2V2-Fr-VP-base/large), and the multilingual model XLSR-53  [6]  (XLSR-53-large). For a fair comparison, we did not use additional data augmentation technique nor ASR encoder pre-training in the experiments. Models We trained Transformer  [46]  models using the FAIRSEQ S2T toolkit  [47] , and using a small architecture with 12-layers encoder, 6-layers decoder, and hidden dimension D = 256. For models using SSL features, we inserted a block of Linear-ReLU before convolutional layers not only to reduce the number of parameters  [48] , but also because we preliminary observed improved performance with this block.\n\nResults shown in Table  5  highlight the benefit of SSL features only in medium and low-resource settings, namely mTEDx: our W2V2-Fr-M-large produces the best results across all language pairs, except for pt which is too low-resourced to obtain decent BLEU whatever the features used. In the higher-resource scenario (CV2), however, the best-performing SSL features are still 2.65 BLEU point below the MFB ones.",

      "text": "After training our own SSL models for French, we evaluated them for four speech tasks (ASR, SLU, AST, and AER) using different architectures (shallow and deep architectures, end-toend or not). The learnt SSL models are particularly beneficial for lower resource tasks (SLU, AST/TEDx, AER) or with simpler NN architectures (AER) but they sometimes fail providing a benefit compared to MFB or MFCCs (End-to-end ASR). Finetuning of SSL models could probably help bridging the gap remaining for some tasks, but we used SSL features 'as they are' for this paper. Furthermore, efficient data augmentations techniques for Mel Filterbanks such as SpecAugment were disabled here to provide a comparison with SSL features, so we should highlight that we did not make the best of our Mel Filterbanks. All of these remarks and findings advocate for more exhaustive and reliable evaluations to assess the real impact of SSL for speech systems. We hope that decentralized projects such as LeBenchmark will contribute to this goal.",
