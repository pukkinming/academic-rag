Many advanced methods rely on learning shortcuts from datasets rather than extracting intended sarcasm-related features. However, our experiments show that shortcut learning impairs the model's generalization in real-world scenarios. Furthermore, we reveal the weaknesses of current modality fusion strategies for multimodal sarcasm detection through systematic experiments, highlighting the necessity of focusing on effective modality fusion for complex emotion recognition. To address these challenges, we construct MUStARD++ R by removing shortcut signals from MUS-tARD++.

      "text": "Multimodal sentiment analysis (MSA)  [50]  integrates various modalities to interpret human emotions, sentiments, and opinions. In MSA tasks, multimodal sarcasm detection  [3]  is particularly challenging due to the subtle contrast between surface meaning and underlying intent, which may convey humor, ridicule, or contempt  [24] . See Figure  1 , Sheldon's words express surprise, but his facial expression shows disgust, and his tone is mocking, conveying sarcasm. Despite advances in large language models, their performance remains capped by supervised baselines, falling short of human-level understanding  [22] . Numerous studies have explored multimodal sarcasm detection (MSD) from various perspectives. Many focus on the inherent characteristics of sarcasm or are specifically designed for prior information: such as contrasting emotional polarity  [30, 44] , or incorporate external knowledge  [49] , character profiles  [26] , emotional cues  [14] , and fine-grained visual features  [40] .\n\nAs shown by issues 1, 2, and 3 in Figure  1 , models tend to learn specific shortcuts. Those shortcuts  [15]  often fail to generalize to more diverse conditions, typically in real-world scenarios. We identify three major shortcut issues in multimodal sarcasm detection research with the representative dataset MUS-tARD++  [35] .  (1)  Heuristics in Character Role Labeling: In sarcasm datasets, some characters exhibit a speaking style that favors sarcasm, such as Sheldon in the TV show THE BIG BANG THEORY. Introducing these character labels during training causes the model to form a bias toward sarcasm associated with a specific person. (2) Label Leakage from Canned Laughter: Canned laughter (artificial background laughter) often causes label leakage. A review of MUStARD++ reveals that canned laughter frequently follows sarcastic utterances, but rarely nonsarcastic ones. Thus, the model tends to classify samples with canned laughter as sarcasm.\n\n(3) Shortcuts of Emotional Inconsistency: The dataset provides implicit/explicit emotion labels, and their contrast serves as a strong indicator of sarcasm. Some models are designed to learn implicit/explicit emotions rather than true sarcasm, limiting their ability to detect sarcasm due to over-reliance on inconsistency.\n\nThe key to understanding the intended complex information and genuinely improving performance is addressing the core multimodal fusion problem, rather than designing modules based on shortcut learning. Various fusion methods  [35, 53, 54]  do not result in significant information gains, some even reducing task performance, highlighting their poor generalization and adaptability to sarcasm tasks. Higher modal complementarity leads to poorer robustness when certain modes are absent or misaligned, and noise has a greater impact on modes with high complementarity  [25] . Multimodal sarcasm detection involves heterogeneous information with complementary but also irrelevant or misleading redundancy. Therefore, this underscores the need for an efficient fusion strategy that integrates complementary information while mitigating redundancy.\n\nTo this end, we construct MUStARD++ R by removing canned laughter, character labels, and emotional polarity from the dataset MUStARD++. Meanwhile, we propose a robust Multimodal fusion framework with a Conditional Information Bottleneck for sarcasm detection, named MCIB. The MCIB achieves the state-ofthe-art performance solely through effective multimodal fusion, without relying on additional shortcut cues. The MCIB offers two key functionalities. First, it addresses the limitations of traditional information bottlenecks by enabling the fusion of more than two information sources, overcoming the challenge of processing multiple modalities simultaneously. Second, our multimodal fusion strategy is designed to extract and separate inconsistent yet relevant information from each modality, effectively reducing inter-modal redundancy and preserving critical features for more accurate multimodal sarcasm recognition.\n\nOur main contributions:  (1)  We conduct an in-depth analysis and provide a comprehensive summary of the critical issues in multimodal sarcasm detection, addressing the issue of learning shortcuts and refactoring the benchmark. (2) We rethink multimodal fusion from a novel perspective and propose a flexible and robust multimodal conditional information bottleneck fusion method. (3) We perform extensive experiments to demonstrate the performance of our fusion method, showing that the model significantly improves the efficiency of extracting meaningful information that aids in sarcasm detection across multiple modalities.",

      "text": "Multimodal Sarcasm Detection has evolved from text  [16]  and image-text  [45]  to video clips, which better reflect real-life scenarios. Many methods leverage sarcasm traits to aid recognition, such as incongruity  [30] . Song et al.  [38]  propose an utterance-level attention and incongruity learning network to capture incongruity representations in sarcastic expressions. Since sarcasm is closely linked to emotions and sentiments, an adaptive representation learning model  [53]  is proposed based on an expert network to analyze the emotion and sarcasm tasks jointly. Chauhan et al.  [5]  design a multitasking collaborative framework for crosstraining and sharing attention between sarcasm, implicit/explicit emotions, and implicit/explicit sentiments. Additionally, Zhang et al.  [54]  employ a dual-gating network and three separate layers to achieve cross-modal interactive learning. Other research attempts to leverage various external information. Studies such as  [27]  and  [49]  have utilized tools like KnowleNet to implement knowledge fusion networks for MSD. Moreover, works like  [43] ,  [40] , and  [34]  enhance sarcasm recognition by incorporating conversational behavioral cues, fine-grained eye gaze information, or deep visual features acquired through self-conditioning ConvNet, respectively. While  [14, 21]  rely on pre-training with explicit and implicit emotions, the best results from  [26]  similarly through character labeling. Besides, some novel approaches  [29, 41]  suggest that quantum mechanics are well-suited for capturing the complexity and uncertainty in sarcasm through a quantum probability-driven model or quantum fuzzy neural networks.\n\nInformation Bottleneck (IB) based approaches  [37, 1]  have demonstrated their effectiveness in various tasks such as cross-modal clustering  [48]  and representation learning  [51, 9] , and have also been widely applied in multimodal fusion. For example, Zhang et al.  [52]  improve multimodal sentiment analysis performance by applying IB constraints to pairs of modalities. Mai et al.  [31]  ensure that latent modal representations can effectively handle the target task by introducing IB constraints between each modality and the predicted target. Chen et al.  [6]  adopt a similar approach, enhancing multimodal fusion by adding crossattention. Furthermore, Liu et al.  [28]  apply IB during the representation fusion stage to discard irrelevant information from individual modalities. Xiao et al.  [47]  propose a two-layer IB structure that minimizes mutual information between input and latent states while maximizing it between latent and residual states. Moreover, conditional mutual information  [46]  has demonstrated strong generalization performance in various applications, such as feature selection  [13] , modality enhancement  [23] , and multimodal selection  [20] . Gondek et al.  [17]  propose maximizing conditional mutual information to obtain relevant but novel clustering solutions, avoiding redundant information already captured by known structures or categories. Li et al.  [25]  demonstrate through CIB calculations that higher modal complementarity reduces robustness while noise impacts highly complementary modes more severely. Thus, recognizing the potential of CIB  [33]  for extracting relevant information in multimodal scenarios, we design a CIB-based method for multimodal fusion.",

      "text": "In the MSD task, some shortcuts arise from task-specific traits, while others capture superficial cues or spurious correlations rather than the true intent of sarcasm. These easy-to-learn shortcut signals hinder the model's generalization to broader testing environments.\n\nHeuristics in Character Role Labeling. Capturing character-specific traits can improve sarcasm detection, but methods relying on character association lack generalizability, as such features are often unavailable in real-world settings. We analyzed the proportion of sarcasm and non-sarcasm in the dialogues of different characters in the MUStARD++. The chi-square test is used to examine the relationship between character and sarcasm, with the null hypothesis stating no association. The test statistic of 166.7 and p-value of 3.89 × 10 -27 provide strong evidence against the null hypothesis. The actors exhibited a distinct tendency towards either sarcastic or non-sarcastic behavior, suggesting that character traits strongly influence the judgment of sarcasm. The experimental findings  [3, 26]  reveal that the majority of models can enhance sarcasm recognition merely by incorporating character embeddings. However, the performance of such models trained with character embeddings will drop drastically when tested on other sentiment tasks. Thus, it is essential to design a robust model that captures the character's intended features rather than relying on character labels.\n\nLabel Leakage from Canned Laughter. Since most sarcasm datasets are derived from sitcoms, they typically include canned laughter. Canned laughter, a prerecorded sound used to enhance humor or guide audience reactions, is also prevalent in MUStARD++. It often follows ironic or humorous utterances, leading to label leakage. Most studies  [2, 42, 26]  ignore the canned laughter while processing the data. Using the pre-trained speech recognition model SpeechPrompt v2  [4] , we validated on MUStARD++ and MUStARD++ R (with and without canned laughter). Compared to MUStARD++, performance on MUStARD++ R shows a significant drop, with F1-score decreasing from 73.47 to 43.59 (a drop of 29.88) and accuracy from 78.33 to 63.03 (a drop of  15.3) . This suggests that the model learned the features associated with canned laughter, indirectly confirming the label leakage issue.\n\nShortcuts of Emotional Inconsistency. Sarcasm is often a sugar-coated bomb, expressing the opposite of its literal meaning by masking implicit emotions with explicit ones. The statistical results from the MUStARD++ dataset reveal that sarcasm is predominantly associated with different emotions, accounting for 99% of cases, while only 1% is linked to the same emotions. In contrast, non-sarcasm is mainly associated with the same emotions (94.7%), with only 5.3% corresponding to different emotions. This indicates that sarcastic sentences often exhibit discrepancies between explicit and implicit sentiment labels. The Phi coefficient analysis supports this observation, revealing a very strong association between emotional consistency and sarcasm (ϕ = 0.94). Many studies  [5, 36, 21]  use this pattern to detect sarcasm. But in real-world scenarios, the explicit/implicit emotion labels do not exist. Moreover, inferring explicit/implicit emotion labels may be more challenging than directly detecting sarcasm. These limitations suggest that relying on explicit/implicit emotion labels for MSD is unfeasible.\n\nTo avoid relying on shortcuts and improve the fairness, robustness, trustworthiness, and deployability of the evaluation benchmark, based on the above analysis of shortcut learning in multimodal sarcasm tasks, we reconstructed MUStARD++ R from the publicly available dataset MUStARD++. Each data sample is annotated with sarcasm labels, implicit and explicit emotions, arousal, and valence tags. The first step in modifying the dataset is to remove all shortcut labels, leaving only those related to sarcasm. Next, we eliminated video segments that contain canned laughter. Specifically, we used the timestamp of the first word in each utterance as the start of the video segment and the timestamp of the last word as the endpoint. By removing labels linked to shortcut learning, MUStARD++ R allows for a more The multimodal fusion component employs three parallel conditional information bottleneck structures to filter out irrelevant information and extract relevant information between each pair of modalities. For each pair of modalities, we first minimize the mutual information between the primary modality and the latent state to achieve filtering and compression through the information bottleneck. We then maximize the conditional mutual information among the auxiliary modality, latent state, and prediction target. Finally, the bidirectional optimization within CIB produces an intermediate representation b that encapsulates the essential information required for our prediction target.\n\naccurate evaluation of multimodal fusion models in detecting sarcasm through integrated cross-modal information.",

Modal Fusion Rethink. We rethink the limited effectiveness of previous fusion methods in light of the complementary and redundant properties of multimodal data. To provide quantitative evidence, we conduct ablation experiments on different modalities (see the appendix). Ablation tests on various combinations of modality reveal limited gains from modality fusion. In some cases, adding modalities reduces performance: audio may decrease overall effectiveness. Figure  3  illustrates the reasons for ineffective modality fusion: the Redundancy region is larger than the Complementarity region, and the overlapping middle region is too small. This suggests that misleading redundant information outweighs the informational gain from the added modality. For effective modality addition, irrelevant information that may mislead predictions should be reduced, while enhancing the benefits of complementary useful information.",

Only the information in the primary modality x p beneficial to the target is preserved, while the auxiliary modality x a provides complementary information to x p . We aim to encode as much task-related (y) information as possible in the latent state b, where b ∈ {b 0 , b 1 , b 2 } represents generation through optimization of the conditional information bottleneck. As shown in Figure  4 , the trade-off between compressing redundant information from the primary modality and retaining complementary information provided by the auxiliary modality is optimized by minimizing mutual information while adhering to specific constraints. We reformulate this constrained optimization problem into an unconstrained Lagrangian form eq. (  2 ), known as the conditional information bottleneck:\n\nwhere I(x p ; b) encourages compression of redundancy from x p . I(b; y | x a ) ensures b retains complementary information useful for predicting y given x a . λ balances the trade-off between compression and retention.\n\nCompress redundancy.

The mutual information between x p and b is: variational distribution q(b | x p ), the upper bound becomes:\n\nWe define the loss term for compression as the KL divergence between q(b | x p ) and r(b). Specifically, in designing the optimizer: choose a standard Gaussian N (0, I) as Prior r(b), while utilizing a transformer architecture to capture detailed and relevant information from x p for simulating q(b | x p ). The encoder models q(b | x p ) as a Gaussian distribution N (µ(x p ), σ 2 (x p )). The latent variable b is obtained by reparameterizing and sampling from q(b | x p ).

Using GENTLE  [39] , we align audio and segment audio at the word level, which then serves as a reference for aligning fine-grained features in the visual modality. Next is the multimodal feature fusion module MCIB, which integrates complementary information across modalities while filtering out redundancy. Specifically, the MCIB minimizes the mutual information between the primary modality x p and the latent state b, condensing x p and filtering out redundant information. Simultaneously, it maximizes the conditional mutual information between the auxiliary modality x a , the latent state b, and the target y, aiming to incorporate additional relevant information from x a so that b holds useful information for predicting y. The model concatenates the trained latent state b for prediction, which contains the \"redundancy-removed, effective complementarity\" information distilled through the conditional information bottleneck.

In addition, we tested the MCIB method on multimodal sentiment analysis tasks (CMU-MOSI and CMU-MOSEI in the appendix), achieving highly competitive results, which validate its generalization capability.\n\nImplementation Details. To extract fine-grained features, we utilize several high-performance backbones. Text features are obtained using a pre-trained De-BERTa  [19] , yielding a representation size of d t = 768. For audio features, Mel Frequency Cepstral Coefficients (MFCC) and Mel spectrograms are generated with Librosa  [32] , along with prosodic features from OpenSMILE 3  [12] , resulting in a combined representation of d a = 291. The video features are extracted by processing utterance frames through the pool5 layer of a ResNet-152  [18]  pretrained on ImageNet  [8] , producing a visual representation of size d v = 2048. All experiments were conducted on Nvidia A100 GPUs with 40GB of memory.
