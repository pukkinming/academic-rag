      "text": "Over the past few years, Federated Learning (FL) has become an emerging machine learning technique to tackle data privacy challenges through collaborative training. In the Federated Learning algorithm, the clients submit a locally trained model, and the server aggregates these parameters until convergence. Despite significant efforts that have been made to FL in fields like computer vision, audio, and natural language processing, the FL applications utilizing multimodal data streams remain largely unexplored. It is known that multimodal learning has broad real-world applications in emotion recognition, healthcare, multimedia, and social media, while user privacy persists as a critical concern. Specifically, there are no existing FL benchmarks targeting multimodal applications or related tasks. In order to facilitate the research in multimodal FL, we introduce FedMultimodal, the first FL benchmark for multimodal learning covering five representative multimodal applications from ten commonly used datasets with a total of eight unique modalities. FedMultimodal offers a systematic FL pipeline, enabling end-to-end modeling framework ranging from data partition and feature extraction to FL benchmark algorithms and model evaluation. Unlike existing FL benchmarks, FedMultimodal provides a standardized approach to assess the robustness of FL against three common data corruptions in real-life multimodal applications: missing modalities, missing labels, and erroneous labels. We hope that FedMultimodal can accelerate numerous future research directions, including designing multimodal FL algorithms toward extreme data heterogeneity, robustness multimodal FL, and efficient multimodal FL.

      "text": "With rapid advances in machine learning (ML)  [39]  in the past decade, modern mobile devices and wearable sensors  [7, 52]  have revolutionized applications and services in industries ranging from entertainment and transportation to healthcare and defense, significantly changing how people live, work, and interact with each other. These intelligent sensing devices, equipped with sensors of multiple modalities, can capture diverse information about a user, including but not limited to physiological, emotional, and rich spatiotemporal contextual information  [4, 6, 17, 22, 54] . These data records are typically transmitted to remote servers for centralized training of the ML models. However, the collection of human-centered data raises significant concerns about compromising user privacy due to association with sensitive environments and contexts, ranging from homes, workplaces, and business meetings to hospitals and schools  [56] . Therefore, it is critical to ensure that modern ML systems can protect user privacy by preventing any unauthorized access to data  [19, 49] .\n\nIn response to this, ML practitioners have developed Federated Learning as an alternative paradigm to build models, without the need to transfer user data from the edge devices  [37] . Unlike centralized training, models are trained locally using locally stored Table  1 : Experimental considerations between FedMultimodal and existing multimodal FL studies.",

FL allows clients to train a model collaboratively without sharing their local data, making it one of the most emerging privacy-enhancing learning algorithms in ML research  [33] .\n\nPrevious works in FL have primarily focused on designing robust and efficient algorithms for federated model training. FedAvg  [46]  was the earliest FL optimization algorithm to train the model in the distribution mechanism. In FedAvg, each client executes local model updates before submitting the updates to the server. Even though FedAvg offers possibilities for deploying FL in the wild, it often encounters slow convergence as a consequence of gradient drifting from data heterogeneity. As such, researchers have proposed algorithms such as stochastic Controlled Averaging Algorithm (SCAFFOLD)  [35]  and FedProx  [40]  to minimize the impact of gradient drift for heterogeneous data. For example, SCAFFOLD accelerates the training speed through control variates which prevent the client gradients from drifting away from the global optima. Similarly,  [57]  introduced adaptive optimization algorithms, FedOpt, that allow server optimization through momentum.\n\nTo facilitate FL research in more diverse problem domains, a number of FL benchmarks have been developed in the past few years. For example, LEAF  [8]  was the earliest FL benchmark which includes multiple FL training tasks on 5 datasets covering various computer vision and NLP tasks. FedML  [28] , besides providing an open-source library and a platform for federated learning deployment, it includes multiple FL benchmarks on computer vision and health  [29] , data mining  [27] , IoT  [80] , and NLP  [43] . More recently,  [38]  announced a multi-domain FL benchmark called FedScale. Fed-Scale included implementations with 20 realistic FL datasets mainly in computer vision and natural language processing applications.  [14]  introduced an FL simulation tool named FLUTE, which covers the application of CV, NLP, and audio tasks. Meanwhile,  [79]  presented an audio-centric federated learning framework, FedAudio, which focused on speech emotion recognition, keyword spotting, and audio event classification. Further, FLamby  [66]  is a recently proposed FL benchmark for a wide range of healthcare applications such as identifying lung nodules and predicting death risks. Feder-atedScope  [73]  also incorporates various benchmarks for federated learning in CV, NLP, and data mining  [71] .\n\nExisting Multimodal Federated Learning Works: While existing FL benchmarks largely focus on unimodal applications such as computer vision (CV), natural language processing (NLP), and speech recognition, a significant number of real-world applications are associated with multimodal data streams. As listed in Table  1 ,  [59]  was one of the earliest to investigate FL using multi-sensory data. They proposed a self-supervised learning approach called Scalogram-signal Correspondence Learning (SSCL) to learn robust multi-modal representations in FL. More recently,  [74]  designed a multi-modal FL framework named MMFed using the cross-attention mechanism. Moreover,  [10]  proposed an FL framework called FedM-Split that targeted the issue of missing modalities in the multimodal setup. CreamFL  [77]  provides a multi-modal FL framework using contrastive representation-level ensemble to learn a larger server model from heterogeneous clients across multi-modalities. However, existing multimodal FL frameworks perform their evaluation using their defined experimental setups, thus making it challenging for researchers to compare their methods with existing state-ofthe-art fairly and effectively.\n\nOur Contributions: In this work, we introduce FedMultimodal, a FL benchmark for multimodal applications. We summarize our key contributions as follows:\n\n• FedMultimodal includes ten representative datasets covering five diverse application scenarios -emotion recognition, multimodal action recognition, human activity recognition, healthcare, and social media -that are well aligned with FL. We present systematic benchmark results on the above datasets to facilitate researchers to fairly compare their algorithms. • To help the community accurately compare performance and ensure reproducibility, FedMultimodal presents an open-source end-to-end FL simulation framework and includes capabilities to perform data partitioning, feature processing, and multimodal training. FedMultimodal offers support for several popular FL optimizers including FedAvg  [46] , FedProx  [40] , Fe-dRS  [41] , SCAFFOLD  [35] , and FedOpt  [57] , and provide flexibility that allows users to customized the trainers on the included datasets. The source codes and user guides are available at https://github.com/usc-sail/fed-multimodal. • In addition to ensuring accessibility and reproducibility, the benchmark provides a robustness assessment module that allows researchers to simulate challenges uniquely tied to multimodal FL applications in real-world scenarios. As listed in Table  1 , previous works on multimodal FL provide limited assessments of the robustness under real-world settings. Specifically, Fed-Multimodal emulates missing modalities, missing labels, and erroneous labels on top of the provided datasets to simulate scenarios when deploying FL systems in real-world settings. This is a crucial difference and a unique contribution of FedMultimodal compared to existing FL literature.",

In this section, we provide a brief overview of each included dataset and the corresponding tasks. MELD is a multiparty dialog dataset  [55]  containing over 9k utterances with audio and transcripts data from the Friends TV series.

In FedMultimodal, we include two well-known MAR testbeds: UCF101 and Moments in Time (MiT).\n\nUCF101 dataset  [63]  consists of 13,320 web videos with 101 sportbased action labels. However, data associated with only 51 labels are presented with video and audio information, resulting in less than 7,000 videos for the experiments. The duration of the videos ranges from several seconds to over 20 seconds. We subsample the video at the frame rate of 1Hz to reduce the computation overhead.\n\nMoments in Time (MiT) is a large-scale MAR ( 1 million) dataset  [50]  with short (3 seconds) videos with overall list of 339 action labels. It is worth noting that MiT is a challenging dataset, with state-of-the-art top-1 accuracy close to 35%  [58] . Given the inherent difficulty of this task, we tackle the easier classification problem by creating partitions of data with fewer distinct labels. We create two sub-datasets, MiT10 and MiT51, from the original MiT dataset. MiT10 and MiT51 contain videos of the 10 and the 51 most frequent labels. Similar to the UCF101 setting, we subsample the video every 10 frames to accommodate the computing constraints in FL.",

To accelerate FL research in this domain, FedMultimodal incorporates two social-media-based multimodal datasets related to hateful content and crisis information classification.\n\nHateful Memes dataset was released from the 2020 Hateful Memes Challenge  [36]  that focus on detecting hateful speech in memes. The database includes 10,000 multimodal data with image and text pairs with binary classes.\n\nCrisisMMD  [1]  comprises 18.1k tweets containing both paired visual and textual information.

Mainly, the selected feature needs to align with the computation capabilities available on the edge computing devices. For example, it is unrealistic to assume that edge devices could load and run large transformer-based  [68]  models for inference purposes without sacrificing system performance. Hence, we focus on implementing mobile-friendly feature extraction pipelines in FedMultimodal which are listed below, targeting swift computation, efficient storage, and ease of deployment.\n\n• Visual: For the visual data, our benchmark supports MobileNetV2  [30]  and MobileViT  [47]  as the embedding network to extract latent presentations. The complete MobileNetV2 and MobileViT have 4.3M and 2.7M parameters, respectively, making them practical visual feature backbones in FL. Due to space constraints, we report benchmark results with MobileNetV2 in this paper. • Text: FedMultimodal integrates both MobileBERT  [65]  and Dis-tillBERT  [60]  to extract representations from textual data. Mo-bileBERT uses a bottleneck structure to reduce the parameter size from 340M to 25M when compared to BERT  [13] , while Distill-BERT applies a knowledge distillation process that decreases the BERT model to 66M parameters. We decide to benchmark with the MobileBERT feature backbone given the page constraints. • Audio: FedMultimodal uses Mel-frequency cepstral coefficients (MFCCs) due to their widespread usage in the state-of-the-art speech recognition models like Wav2Vec 2.0  [11] . • Other Modalities: We use the raw data with the remaining modalities in the FedMultimodal.

      "text": "Model Design Principles. Compared to remote servers, edge computing nodes are more appropriate for lightweight computing tasks due to constraints in computation resources, storage capabilities, battery capacities, and communication bandwidths. When designing ML models for resource-constrained devices, a significant design consideration is to reduce the number of parameters in edge ML models, thus reducing memory and execution latency. Such models can either be the backbone feature extraction models or application-specific prediction models. One major design principle of FedMultimodal is to study lightweight but effective solutions for multimodal FL learning instead of training models with multi-million parameters. Model Architecture. With this design principle in mind, we construct ML models mainly based on the 1D Conv-RNN/MLP architecture. Even though the transformer-based model has achieved SOTA performance in diverse applications, these models typically include millions or even billions of parameters, making them impractical to use in FL settings as a result of massive computations, memory usage, and battery consumption during back-propagation  [70] .\n\nAn example model architecture is presented in Figure  2 . Specifically, the multimodal model in FedMultimodal includes an encoder, a modality-fusion block, and a downstream classifier. The encoder part follows either Conv+RNN architecture or RNN-only architecture. The encoder that adopts Conv+RNN architecture takes the input of audio, accelerometer, gyroscope, and ECG information, otherwise uses RNN-only architecture. Following encoder modules, FedMultimodal uses a late-fusion mechanism to combine modality-specific representations into a multimodal representation. The multimodal representation is then fed through 2 dense layers for downstream predictions.",

On the other hand, the attentionbased fusion concatenates the temporal output from each modality without the average pooling step. We apply an attention mechanism similar to hierarchical attention  [76] . Given the concatenated multimodal data ℎ, the attention procedures are as follows:\n\nThe concatenated multimodal data ℎ is first fed through a onelayer MLP to get representation 𝑢. We then use a context vector 𝑐 to obtain a normalized importance score through a softmax function. After that, we compute the final multimodal embedding 𝑣 as a weighted sum of ℎ based on the weights 𝑎. Here, we can further implement a multi-head attention mechanism by having multiple 𝑐.

In order to provide a comprehensive evaluation of multimodal FL models toward safe and robust deployment, FedMultimodal enables the emulation of missing modalities, missing labels, and erroneous labels for real-world multimodal FL. Missing Modality. In practice, data sources, whether they are microphones, cameras, mobile hardware, or medical electrodes, are prone to data imperfections or complete data losses (e.g., missing modalities) caused by firmware malfunctions, network disconnections, or sensor damages  [20] . Hence, it is critical to design an emulator module to synthesize the cases of missing modalities for some clients. FedMultimodal provides the simulations of missing modalities as suggested by  [10] , where the availability of each modality follows a Bernoulli distribution. We set an equal missing rate 𝑞 for each modality in the following experiments.\n\nMissing Labels. Not only can the multimodal FL encounter data imperfection challenges, it can also suffer from missing label problems. Surprisingly, most prior works have made the ideal assumption that the data stored on edge devices are fully annotated with groundtruth labels. However, in a more realistic real-world FL setting, we argue that only a portion of the data can come with labels. As such, FedMultimodal allows the missing label simulation to assess the risk of decreased robustness. Erroneous Labels. In addition to missing labels, real-world FL implementations encounter label noise as a result of bias, skill differences, and labeling errors from the annotators. Inspired by  [79] , we apply a label error generation process described in  [51] . In summary, the erroneous labels are generated using a transition matrix 𝑄, where 𝑄 𝑖,𝑗 = P(𝑦 = 𝑗 |𝑦 = 𝑖) indicates the chance of ground-truth label 𝑖 being erroneous annotated with label 𝑗.",

Moreover, we set the hidden layer size of RNN as 128. We choose ReLU as the activation function and the dropout rate as 0.2. The number of attention heads is 6 in all experiments. We fixed the batch size for all datasets to 16 and the local epoch to 1 for all experiments. Additionally, we set the training epochs as 200 for all datasets except the MiT sub-datasets. However, the total training epoch is 300 in MiT10 and MiT51 as these 2 datasets contain more data than the other datasets. Hyperparameter details such as the learning and client sampling rates for each dataset are listed in Table  3 .

Specifically, the attention-based fusion mechanism leads to better performances in most high data heterogeneity conditions, but it underperforms the concatenation-based fusion in two synthetic datasets with 𝛼 = 5.0 (low data heterogeneity). Moreover, we observe that the FedOpt algorithm consistently yields better baselines compared to other FL algorithms with a few exceptions in low data heterogeneity conditions. However, we would like to highlight that, in practice, FedOpt requires additional hyperparameter tuning on the server learning rate to reach the best performance. Overall, these results imply that the fusion mechanism is a critical factor impacting multimodal model performance in data heterogeneous FL.\n\nMoreover, HAR tasks are associated with the highest performance scores, suggesting the simplicity of this learning task. In contrast, classification results on the Hateful Memes dataset and CrisisMMD dataset imply that social media classification is a challenging task using FL, with the best model performance on the CrisisMMD dataset below 30%. A plausible explanation is that the pre-trained models that we rely on are not generalized to social media data, generating image and textual features that are unrepresentative of downstream learning models. On the other hand, performances on the MiT51 dataset demonstrate similar findings pointed out from  [50] , validating that MiT is a challenging dataset.

In this experiment, we assume that the availability of each modality follows a Bernoulli distribution with a missing rate of 𝑞. Following the experiment protocol presented by  [10] , we set a uniform missing rate of 𝑞 for each modality, where 𝑞 ∈ {0.1, 0.2, 0.3, 0.4, 0.5}. As described in the multimodal model section, attention-based fusion allows us to train the model even with missing data through masking. To train the model with the missing entries, we fill the missing data with 0  [53]  while masking out the corresponding data points in calculating attention scores.\n\nWe present the relative model performance changes at different missing modality rates in Figure  4 . From the graph, we find that the relative performance changes with missing rates below 30% are not substantial, suggesting that a small amount of missing modalities in deployment does not impact the final model performance in multimodal FL. Furthermore, we observe that the model performance starts to decline substantially at the missing rate of 50%. Surprisingly, we observe that half of the models have relative performance decreases that are under 10%, suggesting that the provided baseline models that use attention-based fusion still learn useful information in these cases. However, we find that the missing modality introduces a significantly larger impact on CrisisMMD data and the HAR applications compared to the other multimodal applications we evaluated.

To compare the impact of data corruption conditions in FL, we plot the relative performance changes with different data corruption conditions at the data corrupted ratio of 30% in Figure  7 . We can observe that performances of multimodal FL are more susceptible to label noises than missing modalities or missing labels. Based on these observations, our future benchmark directions also include implementations of backdoor attacks and mitigation in FedMultimodal.",

      "text": "Scale of Datasets and Models. The dataset selection criteria of FedMultimodal ensures that the chosen datasets are representative and diversified across different dimensions such as application scenarios, data size, and number of clients. In addition, FedMultimodal only includes ML models that align with the use cases of FL, taking into account the computational limitations of edge devices. We acknowledge that FedMultimodal currently does not cover several promising multimodal applications, such as medical image analysis, autonomous driving, and virtual reality, and the range of the supported models is limited. We will continuously update FedMultimodal to support new tasks such as Ego4D  [26] , as well as newer feature extraction models. Scale of Modality Fusion Schemes. Currently, FedMultimodal includes two basic approaches for modality fusion: concatenation and attention. Modality fusion under FL remains an open problem, and our objective is to draw attention to the need for developing more advanced modality fusion schemes under FL  [32, 45] . Data Heterogeneity. As discussed in previous sections, addressing the data heterogeneity challenge is critical in FL. While many FL studies focus their experiments on the unimodal setup, there is a lack of extensive research on tackling data heterogeneity in multimodal FL. To address this gap, the FedMulitmodal benchmark provides opportunities to facilitate fundamental research in this direction. In the future, it is of further interest to explore knowledgetransfer learning approaches as suggested in  [12, 31, 44] , within the context of multimodal FL. Label Scarcity. One major challenge for FL is the lack of qualitative labels. FedMultimodal enables researchers to efficiently perform experiments on multimodal FL with missing labels by providing the ability to emulate experimental conditions with missing labels. We hope FedMultimodal brings unique benefits for ML practitioners to develop self-supervised learning  [15, 78, 84]  and semi-supervised learning  [34, 81, 82]  algorithms under multimodal FL. Privacy Leakage. While sharing model updates is considered to be more private than sharing raw data, recent works have revealed that FL can still be susceptible to privacy attacks. These attacks include (but are not limited to) membership inference attacks  [48] , reconstruction attacks  [25, 83] , attribute inference attacks  [18]  and label inference attacks  [24] . Consequently, an emerging research direction for expanding FedMultimodal is to explore the privacy leakages in multimodal FL. Apart from identifying privacy risks associated with multimodal FL, it is also crucial to investigate privacyenhancing techniques, such as differential privacy  [16, 23, 72]  and secure aggregation  [5]  as promising areas of research within the scope of FedMultimodal to mitigate privacy attacks.",
