      "text": "Recent advances in non-invasive EEG technology have broadened its application in emotion recognition, yielding a multitude of related datasets. Yet, deep learning models struggle to generalize across these datasets due to variations in acquisition equipment and emotional stimulus materials. To address the pressing need for a universal model that fluidly accommodates diverse EEG dataset formats and bridges the gap between laboratory and real-world data, we introduce a novel deep learning framework: the Contrastive Learning based Diagonal Transformer Autoencoder (CLDTA), tailored for EEG-based emotion recognition. The CLDTA employs a diagonal masking strategy within its encoder to extracts full-channel EEG data's brain network knowledge, facilitating transferability to the datasets with fewer channels. And an information separation mechanism improves model interpretability by enabling straightforward visualization of brain networks. The CLDTA framework employs contrastive learning to distill subjectindependent emotional representations and uses a calibration prediction process to enable rapid adaptation of the model to new subjects with minimal samples, achieving accurate emotion recognition. Our analysis across the SEED, SEED-IV, SEED-V, and DEAP datasets highlights CLDTA's consistent performance and proficiency in detecting both task-specific and general features of EEG signals related to emotions, underscoring its potential to revolutionize emotion recognition research.",

      "text": "The high variability in individual EEG signals  [34]  limits the generalizability of deep learning methods in emotion recognition, confining many models to lab settings despite potential wider applications  [35] . Transfer learning, aimed at applying knowledge from one domain to another, has shown promise in EEG analysis, especially in cross-session, crosssubject, and cross-database scenarios  [36] . Research has primarily focused on cross-session and cross-subject scenarios to mitigate EEG signal variability over time and between individuals. Zhang et al.  [37]  introduced a similarity-guided transfer learning method using Maximum Mean Discrepancy (MMD) and TrAdaBoost for closer data distribution alignment. Domain adaptation (DA) techniques like the bi-hemispheres domain-adversarial neural network (Bi-DANN)  [23]  and regularized graph neural network (RGNN) aim to learn domain-invariant representations. Domain generalization (DG) methods, such as the two-phase prototypical contrastive domain generalization framework (PCDG)  [38]  and the Contrastive Learning method for Inter-Subject Alignment (CLISA)  [22] , reduce reliance on new subject data by identifying subject-invariant emotional representations.

The pre-training phase of CLDTA involves five key components: data preprocessing and feature extraction, augmentation, the DTA Encoder, the projector, and the contrastive loss function. Initially, samples are drawn from the EEG data bank and then processed and feature extracted followed by generating a broader sample range through the data augmentation module.\n\nThe DTA Encoder subsequently extracts emotion features based on brain networks from each EEG signal. Ultimately, the projector maps the properties into a high-dimensional feature space to compute the contrastive loss, optimizing the DTA Encoder and projector. During the calibration-prediction phase, the model, which integrates the pre-trained DTA Encoder and an initialized classifier, is fine-tuned using a small set of labeled samples from new subjects. This step enables accurate emotion detection in new subjects. Once calibrated, the model is then ready for emotion recognition tasks.",

This phase involves preparing the EEG data from SEED, SEED-IV, SEED-V, and DEAP datasets, which undergoes preprocessing and data augmentation before being fed into the DTA Encoder. The encoder's output is then projected, and the model is updated based on contrastive loss, which aims to cluster similar emotion features closer in the feature space while pushing dissimilar ones apart, as indicated by the \"attract\" and \"repel\" arrows among subjects' representations. (b) Calibration-Prediction: This phase consists of two steps. First, a small subset of labeled samples from a new subject is collected to calibrate the pre-trained DTA Encoder and classifier. Next, the calibrated DTA Encoder and classifier are then utilized for subsequent emotion recognition in the same subject. Calibration adjusts the model to the new subject's EEG for better accuracy and the classifier links features to emotions for predicting the subject's emotional state.\n\nFollowing the approach in  [45] , we incorporate a diagonal masking strategy (highlighted in blue in Fig.  2 ) to extract brain network knowledge, effectively bridging the gap between fullchannel EEG data and fewer-channel EEG datasets. Moreover, we use an information separation mechanism (indicated by orange dashed lines in Fig.  2 ) to isolate the learned knowledge, thereby enhancing the model's interpretability.\n\n(",

      "section_name": "1) Diagonal Masking Strategy",
      "text": "The self-attention mechanism tends to assign excessively high attention weights to nodes themselves, as shown in Fig.  3(a) . When processing EEG data with fewer number of channels, this sparsity of information can result in diminished accuracy, depicted in Fig.  3(b ). To counteract this issue, Fig.  3(c ) reveals that, in the pre-training stage, we capitalize on the Transformer's high parallel processing capability to focus on learning the brain network knowledge provided by fullchannel EEG datasets through the Diagonal Masking strategy.\n\nThe attention mechanism of the Transformer consists of three vectors query, key and value (QKV). V is updated based on the matching degree of Q and K (i.e., attention matrix A). In this process, Diagonal Masking Operation is like 𝐴𝐴 𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 = 0.\n\n𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷𝑚𝑚𝑙𝑙𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚(𝐴𝐴) = (𝐽𝐽 -𝐼𝐼) * 𝐴𝐴 (4) where 𝐽𝐽 represents a full matrix of ones, and 𝐼𝐼 represents an identity matrix. (2) Information Separation Mechanism The Transformer architecture uses residual connections, which impacts the Diagonal Masking Operation's selfunknown-attention abilities. Furthermore, the connections between EEG channels only can be understood by examining attention weights. An input separation method has been implemented to address this issue. Through this mechanism, the key value input (KV) for each encoding layer is isolated from the network flow and is fixed as a combination of the input encoding and position encoding. The query input (Q) is the only component that gets updated across layers. Fig.  2  illustrates this information isolation mechanism within the DTA, indicated by orange dashed arrows.\n\n(3) Position Embedding and Source Data Embedding\n\nThe query (Q) input employs position embedding to transform the 3D coordinates of 62 nodes, derived from the 10-20 System, into the 𝑑𝑑 𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚 dimension using nonlinear mapping, thereby integrates prior spatial knowledge (P emb ) into the model. To augment the position encoding's expressiveness, we incorporate learnable position encoding ( L emb ). Analogously, source data embedding encodes the differential entropy (DE) features to conform to the 𝑑𝑑 𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚 dimension size. The encoding formula is as follows:\n\nIn the above formula, 𝑝𝑝𝑙𝑙𝑚𝑚 𝑚𝑚𝑑𝑑𝑑𝑑𝑑𝑑 represents the threedimensional coordinates of the channel, P emb is the a priori position encoding. R emb is the learnable position embedding and S emb is the source data embedding. 𝑓𝑓 𝑖𝑖 (•) is the linear function, and acvtivate (•)is the activation function. (4) Self-unknown Attention As shown in Fig.  2 , we have two encoding inputs, Source data Embedding and Position Embeddings, which are, respectively,\n\n, where 𝑑𝑑 𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚 is the feature dimension and 𝑛𝑛 is the number of channels. K and V are fixed in all layers, while the query 𝑄𝑄 𝑖𝑖 is updated with each layer.\n\nConsidering the input 𝑄𝑄 𝑖𝑖 𝐾𝐾 𝑖𝑖 𝑉𝑉 𝑖𝑖 of the i-th encoding layer and the output 𝐻𝐻 𝑖𝑖 , the formula is as follows:\n\n, 𝐷𝐷𝑓𝑓 𝑆𝑆𝜋𝜋𝑚𝑚𝑆𝑆 (9) where 𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆𝐴𝐴(•) represents the self-unknown attention layer, 𝑆𝑆𝐴𝐴(•) represents the self attention layer and 𝐻𝐻 = �𝐻𝐻 1 𝑖𝑖 , ⋯ , 𝐻𝐻 𝑚𝑚 𝑖𝑖 , ⋯ , 𝐻𝐻 𝑛𝑛 𝑖𝑖 � .\n\nIn summary, while retaining the basic structure of the Transformer, the flow of information between the encoding layers in the CLDTA encoding module is as follows:\n\nHere, we note that in the inference training process of CLDTA, the i-th element represented by 𝑄𝑄 𝑖𝑖 will not directly see the corresponding encoding representation from 𝑄𝑄 𝑖𝑖 1 = 𝑃𝑃 1 in any layer. However, during the testing phase, the diagonal masking mechanism is shut down, restoring it to selfattention.",

Each subject participated in three sessions, watching one clip per session for a total of 15 trials.\n\n(2) SEED-IV Dataset: Introduced in  [27] , this dataset features EEG and eye movement data from 15 subjects (7 men and 8 women) responding to 72 film scenes depicting four emotions: joy, sorrow, neutrality, and anxiety. Subjects participated in three sessions with 24 trials each at different times.\n\n(3) SEED-V Dataset: First utilized in  [28] , it comprises EEG and eye movement signals related to five emotions (happiness, sadness, neutral, fear, and disgust) from 15 film clips, with 16 subjects (6 males, 10 females) participating in three sessions. (4) DEAP Dataset: Established by Koelstra et al.  [13] , this dataset consists of EEG signals from 32 channels and peripheral physiological signals from 8 channels, collected from 32 participants watching 40 one-minute music videos. Participants rated the videos on arousal, appeal, likes/dislikes, dominance, and familiarity.\n\nThe SEED series dataset is expected to be an excellent benchmark for pre-training the CLDTA model, as it features a significantly larger number of subjects compared to most publicly available datasets. The datasets were collected in controlled environments to induce specific emotions using video clips, with data captured via a 62-channel ESI NeuroScan system aligned with the International 10-20 system. They offer a broad range of emotional labels for a discrete emotional modeling approach, as opposed to a valence-arousal spectrum. Contrastingly, the DEAP dataset, with its different EEG equipment, data specifications, emotional stimuli, and labeling approach, presents unique challenges for cross-dataset classification tasks.

This study primarily utilized the EEGLAB toolbox  [47]  in MATLAB for pre-processing, which includes data input, electrode positioning, filtering, baseline correction, manual identification and removal of bad segments and channels, independent component analysis(ICA), manual exclusion of irrelevant components, and re-referencing. For the SEED, SEED-IV, and SEED-V datasets, we initially applied a band-pass filter from 0.01 to 48 Hz and a 50 Hz notch filter to eliminate noise. The criteria for rejecting bad channels are as follows: channels with a flatline duration exceeding 5 seconds; channels whose variance exceeds 4 times the standard deviation of the total channel signal; and spatially adjacent channels with a correlation less than 0.6. The criteria for rejecting time segments are: if the variance in each time window exceeds 7 times the variance of the current channel, the window is discarded. EEGLAB's 'spherical' interpolation algorithm is employed to interpolate channels discarded due to volume conduction effects, assigning different interpolation weights based on the proximity of surrounding nodes. ICA is subsequently applied to remove artifacts likely caused by eye movements, muscle movements, or other environmental noise, with up to 5 ICA components being removed. The data is re-referenced using a sample mean reference. We utilize the last 30 seconds of each trial to ensure the stimulated emotions are sufficiently coherent and intense.",

This comparison elucidates the impact of transfer learning on model efficacy in varying experimental setups. The results, as shown in Table  IV , indicate that our CLDTA model, leveraging transfer learning, achieved superior accuracy. Specifically, SEED2DEAP excelled in arousal classification with a 94.11% accuracy rate and a 2.1% standard deviation, while DEAP2DEAP showed higher accuracy in Valence classification at 94.58% with a 1.4% standard deviation. These results affirm the effectiveness of our proposed transfer learning strategy in capturing crossdevice and cross-electrode EEG emotion features.",

      "text": "To assess performance with limited labeled samples, we explored how different quantities of labeled samples affect model calibration, comparing models with and without transfer learning. Figure  5  illustrates that when employing different quantities of calibration samples for fine-tuning, the accuracy of the CLDTA model markedly surpasses that of the fully-supervised baseline across the entire range of sample sizes, with the most pronounced advantage observed in scenarios with limited labeled data. Specifically, for the SEED dataset, CLDTA's performance nearly matches full-supervised training (90.44%) with over 20 labeled samples per category. For SEED-IV, CLDTA reaches 87.88% of full-supervised training with more than 32 labeled samples per category. For SEED-V, CLDTA's performance is close to full-supervised training (77.92%) with over 13 labeled samples per category. Beyond 40 calibration labels per category, the performance of all pre-training models converges.\n\nIn addition, we also recorded the time consumed by the model during the calibration prediction phase, as shown in Table  V . The number of training iterations required for calibrating the pre-trained model is 17% of that required by the randomly initialized model. In terms of training time, this represents a time saving of 91.48%. This demonstrates that pre-trained models are both faster and more stable in calibration compared to fully-supervised models.\n\nFor the DEAP dataset, calibration tests were conducted on three models: SEED2DEAP, DEAP2DEAP, and Rand2DEAP. Results shown in Fig.  6  indicate that pre-trained models on SEED and DEAP achieve nearly similar performances with limited samples, with a mean accuracy difference of 3.7%. This indicates that CLDTA effectively captures subjectinvariant emotional traits, showing resilience to differences in channel numbers and device types. The baseline model showed a higher tendency for overfitting compared to the pretrained models, which adapted better.",

      "text": "For practical applications, minimizing the number of electrodes is advantageous for both feasibility and user comfort. Challenges including disconnections due to head movements, short circuits from excessive conductive paste, and potential electrode malfunctions can impair model performance. To evaluate our model's resilience in the face of such issues, we simulated real-world conditions such as electrode failure and noise interference.\n\nWe used the model pre-trained on the SEED series dataset for our experiments. In the electrode failure test, we simulated failures by setting channel data to zero or replacing it with data from nearby channels, with the number of failed channels ranging from 1 to 40. In the noise interference test, we added Gaussian noise with intensity varying from 0.1 to 3 times the sample variance. The results, shown in Fig.  7 , indicate the pretrained model's superior anti-interference capability compared to a fully supervised model. A small number of electrode failures slightly improved performance by 1.21%, suggesting that redundant channels may introduce noise in emotion recognition tasks. Performance declines in the pre-trained model when failures exceed 26 electrodes, while the fully supervised model's performance gradually decreases with more failures. During the noise interference experiment, the pre-trained model consistently outperformed the fully supervised model at low noise levels. When the noise intensity was under 1, the transfer model's performance decreased by only 4%, a minor reduction compared to the 10% drop in the fully supervised model. However, as noise intensity increased from 1 to 3 times the variance, the accuracy of both models dropped-the pre-trained model by 14.5% and the fully-supervised model by 8.7%. The pre-trained model's initial stability may be due to its reliance on sophisticated features learned during pretraining, making it more resistant to minor disturbances. Yet, high noise levels impact the pre-trained model more as it may inaccurately associate enhanced noise with previously learned features, leading to performance drops. Conversely, the fullysupervised model adapts better to high noise levels, possibly because it continuously fine-tunes parameters to accommodate all variations, including noise.",

By computing cosine similarity between node positions to form an adjacency matrix and retaining only connections exceeding the mean plus 1.8 standard deviations, our analysis (Fig.  8 ) highlights significant involvement of the frontal and temporal lobes in emotion processing, along with observed asymmetry in brain hemisphere activities. These findings align with previous studies  [52] ,  [54] ,  [55] , suggesting a correlation with the spatial distribution of emotions and activation of frontal-parietal networks in response to emotional stimuli. This underscores the distinct EEG signal characteristics during emotion recognition and suggests potential for future research using advanced graph theory to further elucidate the complex interactions between brain regions and emotions.",

      "text": "This section describes the extraction of features by the CLDTA model that align between subjects, particularly when encountering new participants. We utilize the t-SNE algorithm to evaluate the model's performance on previously unseen subjects. Due to space limitations and for clarity, we randomly chose three participants and visualized their spatial characteristics for both positive and negative emotions. Figure  9  illustrates the feature distributions of these three subjects from the SEED dataset in a two-dimensional space using t-SNE.\n\nWe analyzed the ICD and ICS metrics, as detailed in equations (  19 ) and (  20 ), with results displayed in Table VI. Initial observations from Fig.  9     This paper introduces a Transfer Learning framework utilizing contrastively pre-trained CLDTA, which encode EEG signals into subject-independent emotional representations, regardless of channel count. We tested our model against four prominent emotional databases, SEED, SEED-IV, SEED-V, and DEAP, comparing it with current benchmarks. Our CLDTA model presents several advantages over existing emotion recognition methods. It dynamically leverages spatial characteristics of EEG channels based on the 10-20 system, enabling it to accommodate diverse emotion datasets with varying channel counts. Through contrastive learning, the model potentially uncovers shared temporal-spatial patterns among different emotion categories, offering insights with neurophysiological significance. Moreover, CLDTA's ability to model new subjects with fewer calibration data and its enhanced anti-interference capabilities reduce the reliance on costly label collection and manual feature extraction. This facilitates broader and quicker deployment of emotion recognition systems, improving their practical applicability.\n\nHowever, the primary training data source is the SEED series, and despite employing multiple data augmentation techniques, the limited diversity could impact the robustness and generalizability of aBCI models in real-world applications. Additionally, further discussion and research on the topic of negative transfer remain necessary. Lastly, the practical deployment of the model, particularly in environments with a lower signal-to-noise ratio than laboratory conditions, has yet to be tested.\n\nTo enhance applicability in real-world scenarios, future work will aim to collect a more diverse dataset covering a wider range of ages and scenarios, explore the feasibility of large-scale emotional BCI models, and plan to achieve high performance with fewer EEG channels. It is only when aBCI can provide stable and effective performance across sessions, subjects, and dataset tasks that it can be expected to manage the complex and varied emotional recognition scenarios in real-life.",
