      "text": "In this paper, we propose a new Multimodal Representation Learning (MRL) method for Multimodal Sentiment Analysis (MSA), which facilitates the adaptive interaction between modalities through Cooperative Sentiment Agents, named Co-SA. Co-SA comprises two critical components: the Sentiment Agents Establishment (SAE) phase and the Sentiment Agents Cooperation (SAC) phase. During the SAE phase, each sentiment agent deals with an unimodal signal and highlights explicit dynamic sentiment variations within the modality via the Modality-Sentiment Disentanglement (MSD) and Deep Phase Space Reconstruction (DPSR) modules. Subsequently, in the SAC phase, Co-SA meticulously designs task-specific interaction mechanisms for sentiment agents so that coordinating multimodal signals to learn the joint representation. Specifically, Co-SA equips an independent policy model for each sentiment agent that captures significant properties within the modality. These policies are optimized mutually through the unified reward adaptive to downstream tasks. Benefitting from the rewarding mechanism, Co-SA transcends the limitation of pre-defined fusion modes and adaptively captures unimodal properties for MRL in the multimodal interaction setting. To demonstrate the effectiveness of Co-SA, we apply it to address Multimodal Sentiment Analysis (MSA) and Multimodal Emotion Recognition (MER) tasks. Our comprehensive experimental results demonstrate that Co-SA excels at discovering diverse cross-modal features, encompassing both common and complementary aspects.

      "text": "T HE rapid development of deep learning [20], [22] and re- inforcement learning  [59] ,  [60]  has propelled the field of human-computer interaction remarkably. However, humanmachine interactions are predominantly task-oriented yet lack some spontaneous and personalized service due to machines' inability to gain individuals' inner states  [25] ,  [46] ,  [56] . Consequently, a refined sentiment analysis algorithm is urgently required for the new-generation intelligent humanmachine interaction  [52] ,  [55] ,  [57] ,  [58] . In daily life, people unconsciously emit their inner states through a mixture of spoken language, visual clues, and acoustic signals. Analyzing sentiment states or emotion labels in such multimodal contexts is known as multimodal sentiment analysis (MSA)  [23]  or multimodal emotion recognition (MER)  [24] .\n\nMultimodal Representation Learning (MRL) integrates multiple heterogeneous signals into a joint representation and plays a crucial role in the MSA task  [51] . It has derived diverse modality-fusion strategies, including tensorbased operations  [1] ,  [2] , Canonical Correlation Analysis Manuscript received January 17, 2024;\n\n(CCA)  [53] ,  [54] , graph-based fusion  [4] ,  [17] , attention mechanisms  [5] ,  [6] , etc. In recent years, self-attention and transformers have become mainstream technologies for modality fusion due to their distinctive structures in integrating multiple representations  [61] . Nevertheless, within the self-attention mechanism, the inner product between the query and key, which are constructed by different modalities, highlights inter-modal similarities  [7] ,  [12] . It indicates that self-attention-based models extract more modalityshared properties for constructing the joint multimodal representation. However, parts of modality-unique features also complement each other. Hence, there is an urgent need to transcend the modality-shared bias of predefined fusion modes, coordinate adaptive interactions among multiple signals, and achieve precise predictions in individual sentiment states. Besides, capturing sentiment variation over time from heterogeneous signals and representing them in a unified form is an important premise for modality fusion.\n\nIn this paper, we coordinate the adaptive interaction between multiple signals to learn the joint representation through Cooperative Sentiment Agents (Co-SA). Co-SA comprises the Sentiment Agent Establishment (SAE) phase and the Sentiment Agent Cooperation (SAC) phase, which capture sentiment variations within unimodal signals and foster interaction between multiple unimodal representations, respectively. Specifically, in the SAE phase, each sentiment agent contains a Modality-Sentiment Disentanglement (MSD) module and a Deep Phase Space Reconstruction (DPSR) module to express sentiment dynamics in a unified form. The MSD module disentangles sentiment features from raw input, thereby mitigating the impact of diverse modal properties. Inspired by Phase Space Reconstruction  [27] , the DPSR module establishes relationships Fig.  1 . Framework of the Co-SA model. 'V', 'A', and 'T' represent visual, acoustic, and text modalities, respectively.

In the SAC phase, each sentiment agent takes actions based on the respective policy model to determine those unimodal properties that contribute to the joint representation. To further facilitate the interaction between multiple signals, Co-SA defines the tasktailored cooperation mechanism between sentiment agents in policy models and their joint optimization strategies. It also rewards all sentiment agents jointly for their actions, so as to adjust policies mutually. Through the rewarding mechanism, Co-SA will reach the optimal multimodal representation learning strategy. To validate the effectiveness of Co-SA, we conduct comprehensive experiments on multimodal sentiment analysis (MSA) and multimodal emotion recognition (MER) tasks.",

      "text": "Multimodal sentiment analysis (MSA) aims to infer individuals' sentiment states through the cues they inadvertently emitted. These cues encompass behavioral aspects (e.g., facial expressions) and physiological indicators (e.g., electroencephalogram). With the recent surge in the popularity of smart devices, a multitude of users create and upload videos to platforms like YouTube to share their immediate moods. This exponential growth in video data has laid a robust foundation for MSA, predominantly focusing on behavioral cues. An intrinsic difficulty for MSA is to fuse heterogeneous data collected by disparate sensors for a more reliable prediction. Based on the data integration stage, existing MSA works can be categorized into feature-level fusion, decision-level fusion, and hybrid fusion.\n\nFeature-level fusion consolidates several independent representations into a joint representation and subsequently makes decisions  [1] . Decision-level fusion independently processes the features and classifiers of each modality  [16] . It combines the decision vectors from all classifiers to produce the ultimate sentiment prediction. Hybrid fusion represents a combination of both feature-level and decision-level fusion techniques  [9] ,  [15] . Among the above paradigms, decision-level fusion is the most straightforward due to the consistent formats of decision vectors. However, achieving precise predictions through decision-level fusion remains challenging. First, it is hard to determine the reliabilities of modalities when fusing their decision vectors. Secondly, the independent prediction process for each modality fails to capture the relevance between multimodal signals, such as shared and complementary properties.\n\nUnlike decision-level fusion, feature-level fusion makes the most of interacted properties across multimodal signals and combines multiple representations into a powerful joint one. It has become the most popular modality-fusion mode in the MSA task. Tensor-based, graph-based, transferred-based, and attention-based techniques are popular for feature-level fusion. Tensor-based works employ common tensor operations to integrate multimodal representations, like concatenation, outer product, etc. TFN (Tensor Fusion Network) uses a three-fold Cartesian product to establish trimodal dynamic explicitly  [1] . LMF (Lowrank Multimodal Fusion) analyzes that the TFN, performing outer product on high-dimension embedding, has resulted in the computational burden. To optimize TFN, it exploits the parallel decomposition of low-rank weight tensor and input tensor to compute tensor-based fusion  [2] . Analogously, MRRF uses Tuckers' tensor decomposition to disentangle unimodal representations and remove redundant parts to reduce computation. It gets joint multimodal representations by performing the outer product on disentangled modal embeddings  [3] . Some works also construct graphs to learn the joint embedding, where nodes and edges represent modalities and corresponding relationships  [17] . HHMPN successively models the feature-to-label, label-tolabel, and modality-to-label dependencies via passing graph messages  [4] . Transfer-based technology is another popular way of learning the joint representation by transferring one modal representation into another with the encoderdecoder structure. The immediate features output by the encoder are regarded as the joint representation of the two modalities  [10] . The joint representation for all modalities will be obtained by transferring signals in succession. Some works avoid the sequential transfer among modalities. They specify the dominant modality in advance and then transfer other modalities to the specified one to strengthen it. The attention mechanism is widely used for feature-level fusion since it inspires models to focus on some vital features when learning the joint representation. MFN proposes the Delta-memory Attention Network (DMAN) to learn fusion weights for disparate multimodal elements through time. It also designs the Multi-view Gated Memory module to filter noisy features  [5] . MARN applies the attention mechanism to the hidden state of LSTM and aggregates multimodal representations  [6] . MulT applies the intra-modal transformer and cross-modal transformers to alleviate the issue of (1) unaligned multimodal data; (2) long-time dependencies between elements across modalities  [7] . GME-LSTM(A)  [8]  is devoted to addressing unimodal temporal dynamics and multimodal importance issues. It applies temporal attention to the output of the LSTM module to attend to the vital time steps and modal attention to emphasize the significance of each modality.\n\nAlthough the above feature-level techniques have successfully merged multiple signals into a joint representation in form, they care more about modality-fusion strategies yet lack deliberation about specific features suitable for fusion. Recently, there has been a growing awareness that diverse inter-modal properties may significantly contribute to the joint multimodal representation. Several studies have divided raw signals into modality-shared and modalityunique representations prior to the fusion process  [11] ,  [12] ,  [13] ,  [14] . However, these methods still struggle with the challenge of capturing appropriate features from shared and unique components to accurately predict sentiment states. A novel technique that can overcome the limitations of existing fusion modes and adaptively capture significant properties from unimodal signals for the joint representation is still needed. In this paper, we propose to collaboratively deal with multiple signals to learn the joint representation through cooperative sentiment agents.\n\nExcept for the modality-fusion technique, the quality of unimodal representations also significantly impacts the MSA task. Firstly, multimodal data are collected by disparate sensors and represented using distinct digital signal formats. Video, audio, and text data, for instance, are recorded via frames, waveforms of amplitude values over time, and sets of characters, respectively. Meanwhile, each modality carries different levels of modal and sentiment properties. It is essential for MRL to disentangle sentiment features from heterogenous data and represent them in a unified format. Secondly, features from adjacent frames often exhibit severe overlap and minor value fluctuations, making them weak at reflecting temporal dynamics. Moreover, prevalent approaches typically aggregate multimodal representations initially and subsequently extract temporal features, inadvertently neglecting the exploration of unimodal sentiment variations over time. The heterogeneous multimodal data and implicit temporal dynamics have increased the difficulty for sentiment agents in learning significant cross-modal features. To alleviate the above issues, we propose the Modality-Sentiment Disentanglement (MSD) and Deep Phase Space Recognition (DPSR) modules when establishing sentiment agents.",

      "text": "Reinforcement Learning (RL)  [21]  is about an agent spontaneously interacting with the environment, taking actions according to policies, and rewarding them. The environmental state s, agent's policy π, state transition p, and reward function r are essential components of RL. Supposing at time t, the agent perceives the state s t from the environment and takes action a t based on the policy π t . Upon taking the action, the agent receives a reward r t , and the environmental state is updated to s t+1 . The agent repeats the above process until the terminal state s t+k , with a sequence of rewards {r t , • • • , r t+k } accrued. The key to RL is to learn the optimal policy that maximizes the cumulative reward. The Actor-Critic model is a popular algorithm for RL, in which the actor and critic models are used to learn and evaluate policies, respectively  [18] . Cooperative multi-agent reinforcement learning involves multiple agents working together to achieve a coincident goal  [40] ,  [50] . Centralized learning with fully decentralized execution is one of the prominent approaches for cooperative agents  [38] ,  [39] . It entails a central control unit that observes agents' states and regulates their actions during training. After the training phase, the central unit is removed, and each agent independently makes decisions based on the trained policies.",

The elements comprising each modal signal vary across modalities. For instance, text signals consist of sets of characters, while visual data is a collection of frames. Additionally, different modalities exhibit substantial variations in modal properties, noise, and even task relevance. These significant differences pose challenges for sentiment agents when uniformly dealing with multimodal signals during the modality-fusion process. Meanwhile, diverse modal properties also hinder sentiment agents from precisely extracting sentiment-related features. To provide precise sentiment signals for each sentiment agent, we propose the Modality-Sentiment Disentanglement (MSD) module to extract sentiment-related properties during the representation fission process.",

Consequently, we design a sentiment encoder E s i and a modality encoder E m i to extract sentiment-related f s i and modality-specific f m i features from raw input x i , respectively, where i can be selected text t, visual v, and acoustic a data.\n\nwhere θ s i and θ m i are parameters of sentiment and modality encoders, respectively. Features extracted by the modality encoder vary across modalities. To facilitate the modality encoder in extracting as many precise modal properties as possible, we constrain f m i as follows.\n\nwhere F m indicates the function that maps f m i to predicted probabilities. Without the loss of generality, y v , y a , and y t are set as 0, 1, 2, respectively. Moreover, f m i and f s i represent two distinct properties within the same modality. Therefore, to enable f s i to express appropriate sentiment features and prevent the inclusion of modal properties, we impose a significant difference between f m i and f s i .\n\nWhere d is the euclidean distance. L c prevents f s i from conveying any modality-related properties. Additionally, we decouple each modal signal into modality-related and sentiment-related information. To ensure the completeness of disentangled features, we combine the two parts and reconstruct the input xi , preventing the loss of information.\n\nwhere\n\nwhere D i and θ d i are the decoders and their parameters, respectively. ⊕ indicates the concatenation operation. xi is reconstructed unimodal signal. d is the euclidean distance.\n\nTo sum up, the MSD module has three objective functions as follows.\n\nThe modality loss L m allows each modality encoder to precisely extract modality-related properties. The reconstructed loss L r ensures the completeness of information during the disentangled process. The modality-sentiment constraint loss L c prevents the extracted sentiment embedding from carrying any modality-related properties. The stringent constraints imposed by the above objective functions ensure that sentiment agents perceive precise sentiment properties.\n\nIn addition to heterogeneous multimodal data, sentiment variation over time is also an easily overlooked issue. Most MRL models fuse unimodal signals before extracting temporal features. The assumption behind this operation is that sentiment changes in unimodal representation are well presented. However, adjacent frames often exhibit severe redundancy in semantic context, and sentiment variations only manifest in a subtle number of numerical changes, failing to explicitly capture sentiment variations. To alleviate this issue, we draw inspiration from Phase Space Reconstruction (PSR) and propose the Deep Phase Space Reconstruction (DPSR) module to recover sentiment dynamics from existing observations.",

      "text": "The phase space encompasses all feasible states of a dynamical system. In this space, each point, also termed an observation, can be seen as a sampling from the motion trajectory  [27] . These observations exhibit strong correlations, allowing us to recover the system's motions from existing observations. Simultaneously, sentiment changes in each modality can be treated as a distinct dynamic system, with each frame's representation serving as a sampled observation of the motion process  [26] . Therefore, we can apply the PSR theory to recover explicit sentiment dynamics from existing representations. Traditional PSR technology assesses the correlation between successive frames to determine time delay and embedded dimension parameters  [28] ,  [29] . By adjusting observations with these parameters, the phase space significantly reduces redundancy while maintaining relevance at a certain level. Building upon conventional PSR techniques but tailored to the task, the proposed DPSR module reconstructs each observation by incorporating deep learning principles to establish local and global motion information. More precisely, the DPSR module initiates its exploration of motion information of observations by utilizing a cross-correlation matrix W i first.\n\nwhere W i is a T × T matrix, T represents the length of sequence, and each element w pq in W i indicates the correlation between p and q observations. Subsequently, the DPSR module reconstructs each observation with the crosscorrelation matrix to recover the system motion trajectory.\n\nThe aforementioned operations have provided a viable solution for recovering sentiment dynamics by capturing both local and global motion information. To further emphasize temporal dynamics while mitigating redundancy between frames, the DPSR module imposes constraints on the reconstructed observations as follows.\n\nThe objective function mentioned above aims to reduce redundancy among arbitrary pairs of frames to highlight sentiment changes. However, in some scenarios, specific events may repeat at intervals. To enhance precision in constructing sentiment motion, the DPSR module further refines the loss function as follows.\n\nwhere η pq indicates the time interval between p and q frames, which is calculated as follows.\n\nClearly, η pq will be small if the p frame is far from the q frame, and vice versa.",

      "text": "Benefitting from the SAE phase, each agent perceives unimodal representations that carry sequential sentiment variations in a unified form. These sentiment properties can either be homogeneous or complementary across modalities, often referred to as modality-shared and modality-unique features. Solely extracting shared sentiment properties from each modality can be redundant, while constructing the joint representation with only complementary parts may lead to the loss of common characteristics. Thus, extracting appropriate homogeneous and complementary sentiment properties from each unimodal representation is crucial for constituting the joint representation. Yet, it also poses great challenges to related technologies in feature learning simultaneously. Cooperative control pre-defines the communication mode between agents according to the task and adjusts to the optimal policies through rewards. This working mechanism aligns well with our goal of coordinating multiple signals to achieve the optimal joint representation.\n\nInspired by cooperative control, we propose the concept of sentiment agents and realize the interaction between multimodal signals through agents' collaborations to finish the MRL task. We assign sentiment agents for each modality, where unimodal representation f i is the input for each agent. Each sentiment agent has an independent policy model, also referred to as the actor model. It takes actions w i according to the current policy π i to determine valuable properties within the modality. Then, Co-SA combines selected features from all modalities into f = (f v × w v ) * (f a × w a ) * (f t × w t ) and further applies it to downstream tasks, where * indicates the integrated mode. The key to the SAC phase is exactly hitting features that enhance or complement across modalities through w i , avoiding the loss or redundancy of sentiment properties.\n\nTo this end, we carefully designed policy models and their joint optimization strategy to facilitate efficient interactions across modalities. On the one hand, we allow each sentiment agent to perceive its dominant modality as well as its differential features with other modalities. On the other hand, we jointly evaluate all policy models to coordinate captured sentiment properties across modalities. Specifically, in each stage, policy models take their dominant modal representations and different features with other modalities as input for learning common and complementary components, respectively. Taking the visual modality as an example, the visual policy model takes visual representation f v as well as its differential features with the other two modalities f va , f vt as input and output the weight W v .\n\nWhere Clearly, policy models wish to output weights that cause a larger cumulative reward Q. Thereby, the objective function of policy models L actor is optimizing their parameters θ π that maximize the output of the critic model. As for the optimization of the critic model, the Temporal-Difference (TD) Error algorithm  [19]  is employed: , where y i is the predicted probability for the true class, and C is the number of emotion categories. Besides, the calculation of the reward r relies on both the actor-critic and prediction models. To train the model stably, Co-SA iteratively optimizes the prediction and actor-critic model parameters. Thus, Co-SA contains loss functions about the policy, critic, and prediction models in the SAC phase. Co-SA has the total objective function after incorporating losses in the SAE phase.\n\nL p is the predictive loss. It is the mean absolute loss for the MSA task and cross-entropy loss for the MER task. The weights of the four objective functions will be further discussed in the experimental part.",

Co-SA applies popular modality fusion modes to get the joint representation to validate its generality, including addition and concatenation. The discounted factor γ is set as 0.5. For the weights α 1 , α 2 , α 3 and α 4 of loss functions, we will conduct further ablation studies on both MER and MSA tasks. Before training Co-SA, we initialize a replay memory to store a batch of features, weights, updated features, and rewards in each stage. They are sampled to optimize the actor and critic models during each training process. After optimizing the actor θ actor and critic θ critic models, the parameters for the target actor θ ′ actor and critic θ ′ critic models are updated for stable convergence:\n\n, where ζ is set as 0.01. We update Co-SA parameters with the Adam optimizer and adjust the learning rate based on valid loss, multiplying it by 0.95 with the patience of 50 epochs. Co-SA has trained 500 epochs for each task on 2080Ti devices.",

      "text": "The MSD module separates each modal signal into sentiment-related and modality-related properties. It involves three core operations corresponding with the reconstruction loss L r , the modality loss L m , and the sentimentmodality constraint loss L c , respectively. Table . 1 presents comprehensive results for the MSD module, exploring the effectiveness of each loss. Notably, we define the model that excludes all proposed modules as the baseline method in Table. 1. Compared with the baseline model, the MSD module efficiently improves model performance quantitatively on two tasks. Results, eliminating three loss functions by turns, indicate that the MSD module discounts to different extents when lacking one of the three loss functions. The compared results have demonstrated that Co-SA significantly benefits from the disentangled and homogenous sentiment properties in the MSD module. Fig.  2  also presents intuitive disentangled features for three modal signals. In Fig.  2 , each sample is divided into modality and sentiment features. Sentiment features from the same modality are clustered together, as are modality features. However, sentiment clusters maintain a certain distance from their corresponding modality clusters. These visualized results suggest that Co-SA has successfully separated sentiment features from raw signals, thereby reducing the disturbances of diverse modal properties in subsequent steps. Moreover, sentiment features are not clustered across modalities, as their sequential variations need to be processed prior to fusion.\n\nThe 'only DPSR' configuration in Table . 1 presents the ablation study results for the DPSR module. This module mitigates redundancy across representations and emphasizes sentiment variations over time. Compared to the baseline model, the DPSR module generally enhances all metrics on both tasks. Furthermore, the DPSR module utilizes the parameter η to ease the constraint on frame representations as the time interval between frames expands. The performance of the DPSR module sees a slight decline when η is removed, suggesting that repeated events may occur in certain sequences.\n\nTo further scrutinize the DPSR module, we compute the average similarity between features across various time intervals. Fig.  3  illustrates the similarity comparisons between representations without (w/o) and with (w/) the DPSR module. Representations, when not modulated by the DPSR module, show considerable similarities across different times since they are defined by objective characteristics, such as visual AUs and acoustic MFCCs. These objective characteristics exhibit minimal variation within the same sequence and struggle to reflect sentiment fluctuations. However, when the DPSR module is employed, similarities among frames significantly decrease as frame intervals in-  crease. Interestingly, the similarities of representations tend to increase again when their time interval surpasses a certain threshold. This phenomenon fortuitously confirms our assumption in the quantitative ablation study concerning the DPSR module.",

However, due to the constraints observed in the representation of sentiment The optimal results are bolded and underlined, and the sub-optimal results are underlined.\n\nagents, the model that exclusively employs the SAC module does not achieve optimal results. To provide a more intuitive understanding of the SAC module, we visualize the learned weights w i in Fig.  4 . Each value in w i ranges from 0 to 1, signifying the importance of the corresponding features. Notably, the data in the MOSI and IEMOCAP databases are aligned across modalities. Co-SA captures modality-shared features when it learns larger weights at the same frame for all three modalities. Conversely, it captures complementary features when larger weights are distributed among different frames. Initially, models that directly learn fused properties tend to rely on one or two modalities, thereby failing to capture diverse cross-modal features. For instance, the model heavily depends on acoustic signals in the MSA task and emphasizes features in the acoustic and visual modalities in the MER task. This over-reliance on specific modalities overlooks the diversity of multimodal features, rendering the model less robust. In contrast, the proposed SAC phase, benefiting from the feedback reward, repeatedly learns the fused representations and is adept at mining valuable properties across all modalities. Furthermore, compared to conventional methods, Co-SA has unearthed diverse inter-modal features, encompassing both common and complementary aspects.",

In Table  4 , \"V\", \"A\", and \"T\" denote the visual, acoustic, and text modalities, respectively. From the comparison among individual modalities, it is apparent that text data plays a pivotal role among the three modalities. This phenomenon is largely due to the fact that both the visual and acoustic modalities are constrained to use extracted features (such as AUs and MFCCs) as input because of privacy concerns, whereas raw text data can be directly incorporated into Co-SA. Raw data offer a far richer source of information than extracted features. The amalgamation of text with both visual and acoustic modalities yields a noticeable improvement across all metrics, indicating that visual and acoustic signals provide effective supplementary or complementary information. Ultimately, Co-SA achieves optimal performance when all modal signals are engaged.",

We analyze that existing works devote more to modality-fusion strategies. However, some pre-defined modality-fusion mechanisms limit models in perceiving diverse cross-modal features. Inspired by cooperative control, we establish distinct sentiment agents for multimodal signals, each comprising the MSD and DSPR modules that capture sentiment variations. Subsequently, these sentiment agents interact via a policy-learning and policyoptimization mechanism to capture significant cross-modal features. Quantitative results from two tasks have validated the effectiveness of our proposed modules. Moreover, the visualization of intermediate features provides a clear and intuitive understanding of each component of Co-SA. The introduction of multiple sentiment agents opens up a new avenue for research in multimodal data analysis.",
