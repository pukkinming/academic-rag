      "text": "Emotion Recognition in Conversation (ERC) plays an important role in driving the development of human-machine interaction. Emotions can exist in multiple modalities, and multimodal ERC mainly faces two problems: (1) the noise problem in the cross-modal information fusion process, and (2) the prediction problem of less sample emotion labels that are semantically similar but different categories. To address these issues and fully utilize the features of each modality, we adopted the following strategies: first, deep emotion cues extraction was performed on modalities with strong representation ability, and feature filters were designed as multimodal prompt information for modalities with weak representation ability. Then, we designed a Multimodal Prompt Transformer (MPT) to perform cross-modal information fusion. MPT embeds multimodal fusion information into each attention layer of the Transformer, allowing prompt information to participate in encoding textual features and being fused with multi-level textual information to obtain better multimodal fusion features. Finally, we used the Hybrid Contrastive Learning (HCL) strategy to optimize the model's ability to handle labels with few samples. This strategy uses unsupervised contrastive learning to improve the representation ability of multimodal fusion and supervised contrastive learning to mine the information of labels with few samples. Experimental results show that our proposed model outperforms state-of-the-art models in ERC on two benchmark datasets. \n CCS CONCEPTS • Information systems → Sentiment analysis; • Computing methodologies → Natural language processing.",

Emotion Recognition in Conversation (ERC) is a task that assigns emotional labels with contextual relationships to each utterance made by speakers during a conversation.

      "text": "A good friend of mine passed away the other day.\n\n[Neutral] In the development of ERC, early ERC studies  [8, 17, 29]  focused mainly on research methods that only used text features. However, researchers found that text contains many types of utterances that are difficult for models to fully understand, such as irony, and that emotions in conversation also change with the dynamic interactive process. Since it is difficult to fully understand the conversational context, using only text is insufficient to capture emotional cues in the conversation for accurate emotion prediction. Therefore, people have attempted to expand the model's input from a single modality to multiple modalities (such as visual, audio, videos, etc.). As shown in Figure  1 , using a single modality always leads to prediction errors, but using more types of modality information, the problem of semantic limitations of using only text can be mitigated. However, after introducing multiple modalities, since each modality is in a different semantic space, cross-modal information interactions will introduce a lot of noise if the semantic gaps in them are not considered. For example, Hu et al.  [15]  constructed a modality interaction graph by treating different modality features as nodes. Although this method uses multiple modality information, it does not consider the semantic gap between modalities and directly performs information interaction across modalities, leading to suboptimal fusion effects and affecting the final emotion prediction.\n\nIn addition, because the ERC datasets contained many semantically similar but few sample labels (e.g., fear and disgust, happy and excited), some previous studies  [13]  concluded that the number of these label samples was less and their results were not statistically significant, so they were merged into other similar emotion category samples. Although this approach can improve the accuracy of emotion prediction, from a psychological perspective  [1, 7, 20]  , each emotion category reflects its independent emotional intensity, and simply combining emotion categories leads to oversimplification and may not accurately capture the emotional complexity and diversity of experience. Furthermore, since each emotion label represents the user's emotional state, accurate predictions should be obtained for each category label in real-world scenarios.\n\nTo address the above problems, we propose a new model for ERC, namely Multimodal Prompt Transformer with Hybrid Contrastive Learning (MPT-HCL). Firstly, in order to extract emotional cues from the text, we construct exclusive relationship graphs from both the speaker and context levels to extract emotional cues at different levels. For the audio and visual modalities, we filter the features using a designed modal feature filter, which filters out low-level features with more noise and retains high-level features with valid information. Due to previous research demonstrating the importance of text modality  [39, 42] , we consider text as the main modality feature and refer to the filtered features of audio and visual as textual prompt information. Then, we use MPT for information interaction between modalities. MPT embeds the interaction of multiple modalities into each attention layer of the Transformer, allowing the multimodal prompt information to participate in text feature encoding and fusion with multi-level text information, thus reducing noise generation and using the multimodal fusion result for emotion prediction of each utterance. Finally, to better optimize the model's performance, on one hand, we use unsupervised contrastive learning (UCL) to repeatedly extract mutual information  [2]  between the fusion features and each unimodal modality, in order to mine the relationship between modalities and optimize the fusion feature representation. On the other hand, we use supervised contrastive learning (SCL) to mine the relationship between fused features and labels in the sample. As SCL aggregates less sample labels by treating all samples with the same label in a batch as positive examples, it enhances the presence of less sample labels in the batch. Through this hybrid contrastive learning method, the feature representation of multimodal fusion can be optimized, thus effectively improving the accuracy of prediction for less sample labels. In summary, the main contributions of this paper are summarized as follows:\n\n• We propose a novel approach of using filtered modality information as multimodal prompt information, and designing a multimodal prompt transformer for cross-modal information interaction to enhance the fusion effect of multiple modalities. • For the first time in multimodal ERC, we introduced hybrid contrastive learning to separately explore the information between the fused modal features and each modality, as well as the information in the labels of the samples.\n\n• We propose a new ERC model, MPT-HCL, which adopts a multimodal fusion method with hybrid contrastive learning to improve context understanding and the accuracy of multimodal ERC. • We conducted extensive experiments on two public benchmark multimodal datasets, including IEMOCAP  [3]  and MELD  [32] .\n\nThe results showed that our proposed MPT-HCL model is more effective and superior to all SOTA baseline models.",

We design speaker-aware RGCN (Sa-RGCN) and context-aware RGCN (Ca-RGCN) as the core modules for emotion cue extraction in text modality. In these modules, edges are used to measure the importance of connections between nodes. The type of edge defines the method of propagation of different information between nodes. Sa-RGCN and Ca-RGCN have the same edges, but each edge represents a different dependency, and we will describe the composition of these two modules in detail next.\n\nEdge: For each node, its interaction with the context nodes should be considered. If each node 𝑣 𝑖 interacts with all the context nodes 𝑣 𝑗 , the constructed graph contains a large number of edges, which usually leads to the problem of computational difficulties due to the huge number of parameters. To solve this problem, we fix the context window size to 𝑤 , so that each node 𝑣 𝑖 interacts with only {𝑣 𝑗 } 𝑚𝑖𝑛 (𝑖+𝑤,𝐿) 𝑗=𝑚𝑎𝑥 (𝑖 -𝑤,1) context nodes. In our model implementation, we perform the selection of 𝑤 within 𝑤 ∈ {1, 2, 3, 4} and the edges 𝑒 𝑖 𝑗 denote nodes 𝑣 𝑖 to 𝑣 𝑗 .\n\nSpeaker-aware RGCN: Sa-RGCN uses different speakers and their spoken utterances to capture the dependencies of the speakers in a conversation. Specifically, we assign a speaker identifier 𝛼 𝑖 𝑗 ∈ 𝛼 to each edge 𝑒 𝑖 𝑗 . Here 𝛼 denotes the set of speaker types in the conversation, and |𝛼 | denotes the number of 𝛼. For each edge 𝑒 𝑖 𝑗 , 𝛼 𝑖 𝑗 serves as the set of 𝑝 𝑠 (𝑢 𝑖 ) → 𝑝 𝑠 (𝑢 𝑗 ) , where 𝑝 𝑠 (𝑢 𝑖 ) and 𝑝 𝑠 (𝑢 𝑗 ) denote the speaker identifiers of 𝑢 𝑖 and 𝑢 𝑗 , respectively.\n\nContext-aware RGCN: Ca-RGCN uses contextual information to capture the contextual dependencies in a conversation. Specifically, we assign a context type identifier 𝛽 𝑖 𝑗 ∈ |𝛽 | to each edge 𝑒 𝑖 𝑗 , where 𝛽 denotes the set of context types in the conversation.\n\nBased on the relative positions of 𝑢 𝑖 and 𝑢 𝑗 in the conversation, we will perform 𝛽 𝑖 𝑗 value determination from {𝑝𝑎𝑠𝑡, 𝑝𝑟𝑒𝑠𝑒𝑛𝑡, 𝑓 𝑢𝑡𝑢𝑟𝑒}, so |𝛽 |=3.  information through the edges, and the parameters depend on the type of the edges.

      "text": "We consider the audio and visual features obtained by the modal feature filters module as textual prompt information, and update all text states with the prompt information when executing crossmodal attention sequentially. In this way, the final fusion feature will have the ability to encode both the context and cross-modal semantic information, which effectively alleviates the problem of noise generated by unrelated elements in the process of multimodal fusion.\n\nPrompt Attention. First, we project the textual feature sequence 𝑆 𝑡 = {𝑠 𝑡 𝑖 } 𝐿 𝑖=1 ∈ R 𝐿×𝑑 enhanced with emotional cues into the query/key/value vector, i.e., 𝑄 = 𝑆 𝑡 𝑊 𝑄 , 𝐾 = 𝑆 𝑡 𝑊 𝐾 , 𝑉 = 𝑆 𝑡 𝑊 𝑉 , where 𝑊 (•) is the trainable parameter matrix. Then we prepend the visual prompt feature sequences 𝑆 𝑣 = {𝑠 𝑣 𝑖 } 𝐿 𝑖=1 ∈ R 𝐿×𝑑 and audio prompt feature sequences 𝑆 𝑎 = {𝑠 𝑎 𝑖 } 𝐿 𝑖=1 ∈ R 𝐿×𝑑 obtained from the modal feature filters to each attention layer of the Transformer, respectively, and we call this proposed prepending method Prompt Attention (PA), by which the prompt features are used for effective cross-modal interaction, as implemented in the following equation shown:\n\nwhere [; ]denote feature concatenate, 𝑌 𝑡 𝑣 ∈ R 𝐿×𝑑 is the result of the weight of a layer of PA. In this approach, multiple attentions are combined to obtain the output results of the multihead attention layer as follows:\n\nwhere 𝑌 1 𝑡 𝑣 , . . . , 𝑌 𝑛 𝑡 𝑣 is the output of each attention layer, 𝑛 is the number of attention layers, and 𝑊 is the trainable parameter matrix. PA is used to perform cross-modal interaction processes between text modalities and multimodal prompt information.\n\nMultimodal Prompt Transformer. Based on the above PA, we design the Multimodal Prompt Transformer (MPT) with the structure shown in Figure  2(c ). Since we embed multimodal interactions into each attention layer of the Transformer, visual and audio features can participate in the encoding of text features and fuse with multi-layered text information. Low-level syntactic features encoded by the shallow Transformer layer and high-level semantic features encoded by the deep Transformer layer  [30, 37]  interact with the visual and audio prompt features, enabling the fusion of information across modalities. In addition depending on the multimodal prompt features used, as more effective feature representation can fully exploit the fusion effect between modalities.\n\nWe use a residual connectivity layer with regularization to normalize the output of the multihead attention layer of Eq.(  8 ) and use a position feedforward sublayer to obtain the output of the attention: 𝑁 = 𝑁𝑜𝑟𝑚(𝑌 𝑡 𝑣 + 𝑀𝑢𝑙𝑡𝑖ℎ𝑒𝑎𝑑 (𝑌 𝑡 𝑣 ))\n\nwhere 𝑊 1 ,𝑊 2 is the weight parameter and 𝑏 1 , 𝑏 2 is the bias parameter. In this process each modal prompt feature is continuously updated with the feature of the text by the above method to obtain better fusion results, and finally we use self-attention to collect the sequence information of the modal fusion features to obtain the multimodal fusion result 𝑋 ∈ R 𝐿×𝑑 for the current conversation:\n\nConnecting the above Eq.(  8 ) to  (10) , we can input different modal prompt features and text features to MPT to obtain the modal fusion feature representation:\n\nwhere 𝑆 𝑡 , 𝑆 𝑣 , 𝑆 𝑎 denote the text, visual and audio features obtained by different learning methods as the input to the MPT, and 𝑋 𝑡 𝑣 , 𝑋 𝑡𝑎 denote the multimodal fusion results obtained after prompting the text with visual prompt features and audio prompt features, respectively. We concatenate the outputs from different MPTs to obtain the fused features 𝑋 𝑚𝑝𝑡 ∈ R 𝐿×2𝑑 :\n\nFinally, in order to fully utilize the text feature representation, we combine 𝑋 𝑚𝑝𝑡 with the text modality to obtain the final representation of the current utterance used for emotion prediction 𝑋 𝑓 𝑢𝑠𝑖𝑜𝑛 :\n\n𝑋 𝑓 𝑢𝑠𝑖𝑜𝑛 = 𝑆 𝑡 ⊕ 𝑋 𝑚𝑝𝑡 (13)",

      "text": "Unsupervised contrastive learning. Although a better representation of the fusion features is obtained by the MPT, the relationship between each unimodal modal and the fusion features is not entirely explored, so we use unsupervised contrastive learning(UCL) to exploit the connection between them and thus optimize the obtained fusion features. We repeat the mutual information maximization between the fusion results and the input modalities, and the optimization goal is to fuse the network from each unimodal modal to the fusion features. Since we now obtain the multimodal fusion result 𝑋 𝑚𝑝𝑡 by the constructed MPT network , but the mining of the connection from the fusion feature 𝑋 𝑚𝑝𝑡 to each unimodal input 𝑆 𝑥 , 𝑥 ∈ {𝑎, 𝑣, 𝑡 } is missing. So we follow the operation of  [36]  and use the score function 𝑆𝑐𝑜𝑟𝑒 (•) with normalized prediction and true vector to measure the connection between them as follows:\n\nwhere 𝐺 𝜑 is a neural network with parameter 𝜑 that generates a prediction for 𝑠 𝑥 from 𝑋 𝑚𝑝𝑡 , and || • || 2 is the Euclidean norm. We treat all other representations of the modality in the same batch as negative samples, and thus calculate the loss between the individual modality and the fused features:\n\nFinally, the loss function of UCL consists of the losses between the fused features 𝑋 𝑚𝑝𝑡 (noted here as 𝑥) and the text, visual and audio, respectively:\n\nSupervised contrastive learning. Supervised contrastive learning(SCL) assumes that attention will be paid to certain key labels, and then treats all samples in the batch with the same label as positive samples and those with different labels as negative samples by making full use of the label information. Specifically for ERC, since the number of samples in each category in the dataset is very imbalanced, such that the information of these samples is masked in the process of calculating the loss. In addition, if only one sample exists in a category batch, it cannot be directly applied to the loss calculation. Therefore, in order to ensure that a sufficient number of feature representations are available for the loss calculation each time, we combine the obtained multimodal fusion features and text features at the position of sequence length. For a batch with 𝐿 training samples, we can obtain 2𝐿 samples in this way, after which the SCL loss L 𝑆𝐶𝐿 is calculated as follows:\n\nwhere 𝐶 ∈ R 2𝐿×𝑑 , 𝑖 ∈ 𝐼 = {1, 2, . . . , 2𝐿} denotes the index of samples in a batch, 𝜏 ∈ 𝑅 + denotes the temperature coefficient used to control the distance between samples, 𝑃 (𝑖) = 𝐼 𝑗=𝑖 -{𝑖} denotes the samples with the same emotion category as 𝑖 but excluding 𝑖 itself, |𝑃 (𝑖)| denotes the number of samples, and 𝐴(𝑖) = 𝐼 -{𝑖} denotes the samples in a batch other than itself.",

Models marked with \"*\" only use the text modality, and \"-\" indicates that the results were not reported. The best results are highlighted in bold. All other results are reported in their respective papers. On the one hand, compared to existing methods, our model achieved better utterance representations through pretrained language models in sentence encoding. On the other hand, as shown in Tables 3 and Tables 4, we found that: (1) Our proposed MPT-HCL outperforms all baseline models in both evaluation metrics, demonstrating the effectiveness of our model in multimodal ERC. (2) MPT-HCL achieves the best results in almost all emotion categories when compared to EmoCaps. Taking the MELD dataset as an example, our approach outperforms EmoCaps by a large margin in predicting labels with few samples, such as Fear and Disgust. This demonstrates the effectiveness of our multimodal fusion method and the specifically designed hybrid contrastive learning strategy for handling labels with few samples. (3) The overall effect of MPT-HCL is better than MM-DFN, which is a recent model using speaker information.This highlights the effectiveness of utilizing dialogue information in our approach. We consider the reasons for emotional changes in human communication in real life, which are often influenced either by the words spoken by others or by one's own mood. Therefore, we extract contextual cues from both the speaker's own utterances(Speaker-aware) and the interaction between speakers(Context-aware), which leads to superior results compared to MM-DFN.",

      "text": "6.2.1 Various Modalities. Table  5  shows the performance of our model on the MELD and IEMOCAP datasets under different modal combinations. We can observe that:  (1)  The performance of multimodal inputs is better than that of unimodal inputs. Furthermore, among the three modalities of text, audio, and visual, just as we intended to use text as the main modality and other auxiliary modality features as prompt, the text modality performs better than the other two modalities. (2) After adding the text modality, the combination of visual and audio shows a significant improvement in performance. This suggests that the text modality plays an important role in ERC, while audio and visual serve as auxiliary features to improve the accuracy of the model's recognition. This is consistent with our goal of filtering the audio and visual modalities to extract more effective features. (3) When comparing the normal modal combination (i.e., T+A+V) with our feature-filtered modal combination, we found that the latter is more effective for modality interaction. This is because the visual and audio modals were originally used as auxiliary modalities. By further filtering their features and retaining their useful high-level features as prompt information for the text modality, we obtained a more effective multimodal fusion feature representation.",

      "text": "To study the contribution of each module in MPT-HCL, we performed an ablation study on both datasets. We consider the following settings:\n\n• Full A: We do not use MFF to filter audio feature.\n\n• Full V: We do not use MFF to filter visual feature. Table  6  shows the results of our ablation experiments, from which we can conclude that: (1) With Full A/V, we can see that unfiltered modality features introduce a lot of noise when exchanging information across modalities, and the visual modality has more noise than the audio modality due to the complex scenes in the data.  (2)  We can observe that not using MPT yields poor performance. This can be attributed to the lack of information interaction between modalities and the inability of simple concatenation to leverage complementary effects. It introduces significant noise and leads to a confused feature representation, resulting in subpar performance. (3) Our proposed HCL is very effective as removing any contrastive loss leads to a decrease in model performance. This module performs better on the MELD dataset, as this dataset has more minority class labels. (4) After removing the Sa/Ca-RGCN emotion cue extraction module, a significant performance drop was observed on both datasets. This is because both datasets involve conversation between two or more speakers, and capturing emotional cues from speakers and contextual information in conversation is crucial. However, although we constructed a speaker-aware relational graph and utilized the relationships between speakers, we did not fully explore the independent information of each speaker, especially in the case of MELD, which consists entirely of multi-party dialogues. Therefore, the performance of this module on the MELD dataset was not as significant as that on the IEMOCAP dataset.",

      "text": "In order to conduct a qualitative analysis of the hybrid contrastive learning(HCL), we used t-SNE  [12]  to visualize the initial distribution of some data and the hidden layer status of the model after using HCL. As shown in Figure  3 , when HCL loss is not used, the samples between different labels are randomly scattered, and some samples with similar emotions also overlap, which increases the difficulty of the model learning decision boundaries and leads to large errors in predicting similar labels. With the use of HCL, it can be clearly seen that the coupling degree between different categories gradually increases, resulting in a significant category aggregation effect. This shows that the hybrid contrastive learning strategy we designed plays an important role in sample classification. It is worth noting that although our hybrid contrastive learning has already achieved good category division of samples, we can still see obvious errors in some samples. We analyzed the reason to be that the number of this sample compared to the other labeled samples in the entire batch was the highest, which led to the problem of predicting other labels as this category, and this is a problem that we need to further address.",

Figure  4  provides a representative example of the MELD test set. In this example, 𝑃 𝐴 and 𝑃 𝐵 try around whether the chick can swim or not, resulting in a final finding that the chick is about to get into danger resulting in an emotion shift from neutral to fear. We observe that our model is more accurate in making emotion predictions compared to the unimodal DialogueRNN and CoG_BART models for the following reasons: for turn 4, the utterance ends up being incorrectly predicted due to its forward position without much contextual information and without other modal information as an aid. In MM-DFN, for turn 7, the utterance had too little content and the corresponding other modal features could not provide effective help, which led to the model not getting a good fusion representation in the multimodal fusion process of the sentence, resulting in the wrong prediction of the final emotion.\n\nOur model first enhances the extracted conversational context with two levels of emotional cue extraction to avoid the problem of capturing insufficient feature content, and also adds less sample labels to the model when predicting the emotion after obtaining valid features by using a hybrid contrastive learning method. Therefore, our model achieves good results in the whole prediction process in both emotion transfer and few-sample prediction.",

      "text": "We present a new multimodal prompt transformer with hybrid contrastive learning (MPT-HCL) model for ERC. The RGCN is used to extract emotional clues in the conversation, and different levels of emotional clues are extracted to enhance the text modality. Modal feature filters are designed for the visual and audio modalities to filter features and obtain prompt information for the text modality, through MPT to result in better multimodal fusion feature representation. On this basis, hybrid contrastive learning is used to optimize the fusion feature representation and to explore the information of few labels in the samples, thereby improving the prediction accuracy of few sample labels. In the future, we will explore the joint methods for identifying emotional causes and emotional recognition to alleviate the problem of error propagation in information.",
