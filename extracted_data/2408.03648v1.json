      "text": "The utilization of automated depression detection significantly enhances early intervention for individuals experiencing depression. Despite numerous proposals on automated depression detection using recorded clinical interview videos, limited attention has been paid to considering the hierarchical structure of the interview questions. In clinical interviews for diagnosing depression, clinicians use a structured questionnaire that includes routine baseline questions and follow-up questions to assess the interviewee's condition. This paper introduces HiQuE (Hierarchical Question Embedding network), a novel depression detection framework that leverages the hierarchical relationship between primary and followup questions in clinical interviews. HiQuE can effectively capture the importance of each question in diagnosing depression by learning mutual information across multiple modalities. We conduct extensive experiments on the widely-used clinical interview data, DAIC-WOZ, where our model outperforms other state-of-the-art multimodal depression detection models and emotion recognition models, showcasing its clinical utility in depression detection.",

      "text": "The diagnosis of depression in clinical settings often involves the use of interview-based instruments  [66] , in which mental health experts conduct clinical interviews with patients, assessing their symptoms  [53, 66, 68, 89] . Due to the gradual and varied manifestation of depressive symptoms among individuals  [13, 17, 18, 48] , clinicians employ a structured interview process, which involves specific questionnaires and criteria, to detect a wide range of verbal and non-verbal symptoms of depression in patients' speech, behavior, facial expressions, and immediate responses during conversations  [46, 71, 79] .\n\nInterview-based diagnostic methods have proven highly effective in interpreting patient responses  [29, 53] . Mental health experts strategically incorporate follow-up questions in conjunction with primary questions to gather additional information from patients, thereby enhancing their understanding of the exhibited depressive symptoms  [68] . In a case where a response from an initial follow-up question is insufficient for diagnosis, further follow-up questions can be employed to synthesize the patient's responses. By employing hierarchical questions during clinical interviews, clinicians can obtain a comprehensive understanding of depressive signals and the patient's overall condition, leading to improved diagnostic accuracy  [17, 68] .\n\nUsing clinical interview data, many scholars have proposed methods that can detect depression by analyzing revealed verbal (e.g., textual) or non-verbal (e.g., visual or acoustic) signals. Some studies have delved into visual cues, encompassing facial expressions and head poses  [4, 5, 31, 51] . Additionally, a series of investigations has focused on acoustic and textual cues, with the goal of diagnosing depression based on linguistic patterns, vocal qualities, pitch, and loudness  [2, 43, 63, 82, 91] . Nevertheless, these approaches have treated the entire input sequence as a singular entity, disregarding the structured nature of clinical interviews. Given the use of structured questionnaires and conversational exchanges during these interviews, considering the interview data as a single input sequence can be less effective for depression detection in  clinical settings  [32, 87] . A few studies have sought to consider the conversations, including questions and answers during the clinical interviews  [11, 45, 52, 80, 81, 87] . However, their focus has primarily been on analyzing questions and answers in an interview without specifically modeling the relationship between primary and follow-up questions based on question types, which can be crucial in modeling and analyzing the structure of a clinical interview. Besides, there has been a lack of analysis on the interaction among multi-modalities in analyzing structured clinical interviews  [2, 19, 25, 37, 44, 59, 65, 87] ; different modalities can be different cues depending on questions and answer types.\n\nTo address these challenges, we propose HiQuE (Hierarchical Question Embedding network), a novel depression detection framework that leverages the hierarchical relationship between primary and follow-up questions in a clinical interview. Inspired by the clinical interview strategy employed by medical professionals for diagnosing depression, HiQuE incorporates a hierarchical embedding structure and interview-specific attention modules. These modules enable HiQuE to comprehensively assess the mutual information between multiple modalities within interviews, replicating the diagnostic approach used by clinicians. As illustrated in Figure  1 , the interview sequence is divided into primary questions and their corresponding follow-up questions. Using the question-aware module, HiQuE calculates the significance of each question and effectively enhances the mutual information across modalities using cross-modal attention, resulting in accurate depression diagnosis. The contributions of this study can be summarized as follows:\n\n• To the best of our knowledge, HiQuE is the first attempt that analyzes the significance of all questions posed by the interviewer by explicitly categorizing them as primary and follow-up questions, considering their order and relationship. Our publicly available code 1  encompasses both the hierarchical question embedding process and the HiQuE. • This is the first interpretable multi-modal analysis conducted in a clinical interview context by analyzing both intra-modality and inter-modality attention scores. The quantitative evaluation of the interaction and importance of different modalities in depression detection provides deeper insights into the complex dynamics of clinical interviews. • HiQuE achieves the state-of-the-art performance on the DAIC-WOZ dataset, among other multimodal emotion recognition models as well as prior depression detection models that utilized the DAIC-WOZ dataset. HiQuE also demonstrates superior adaptation to the E-DAIC-WOZ dataset, highlighting its generalizability to unseen question scenarios.",

      "text": "Researchers have identified distinctive features across various modalities, including acoustic patterns, visual characteristics, and language usage in clinical interviews. For instance, individuals with depression often exhibit specific acoustic features, such as slower speaking rates, lower pitch ranges, and reduced loudness  [6, 9, 20, 36, 75, 76, 79]  as well as visual features, including discernible facial expressions characterized by sadness, minimal head movement  [5] , unstable facial expressions  [14, 78] , and irregular eye-gazing patterns  [33, 40] . Moreover, they often reveal negative emotions in language, utilize a higher frequency of first-person pronouns, and exhibit intense focus on specific words  [3, 61, 85] . These findings highlight the crucial role of incorporating multiple modalities for effective depression detection to develop a comprehensive understanding of an individual's symptoms  [17, 18, 48] .",

      "text": "There have been a considerable number of proposals to detect depression by developing machine learning algorithms or natural language processing techniques  [41, 47] . Initially, a substantial efforts were dedicated to extracting representative features  [69, 70]  and creating single-modality models for depression detection  [30, 51, 77, 82, 83] . Furthermore, as Multimodal Sentiment Analysis (MSA)  [49, 67]  gained momentum with the recognition of various verbal and non-verbal symptoms of depression in psychological research, researchers made significant attempts to incorporate context-aware attention  [10]  and multimodal attention  [26]  to capture diverse  information across multiple modalities  [18, 23, 37, 62, 86, 88] . Recently, there have been attempts that analyze the word-sentence relations on interviewee's answers  [45, 59, 81, 87, 92]  as well as the correlation between question-answer pairs  [24, 52, 80] , which can be cued in identifying depression. Unfortunately, no research exists yet that explains how an attention score of modality manifests in a specific question or how the degree of modality reflection changes with the sequence of primary and follow-up questions and answers, which can be crucial in modeling and analyzing the structure of a clinical interview. To bridge this gap, we introduce the first interpretable multimodal depression detection framework that leverages the hierarchical relationship between primary and follow-up questions in a clinical interview.",

Some prior studies addressed this issue by employing data augmentation techniques like random masking  [7, 43, 65] . Inspired by these, we tripled the size of the depression dataset by randomly masking 10 out of 85 questions in each 85 × 𝑁 question-embedded interview sequence, aligning it with the size of the non-depression dataset during training. Specifically, we first segmented the interview sequences into question-answer (Q-A) pairs based on timestamps, starting from the interviewer's question to the participant's response. Then, we randomly masked ten Q-A pairs per interview, corresponding to the interviewer's questions.

Each question is associated with a specific topic code, such as labeling \"How has seeing a therapist affected you?\" as therapist_affect and \"Where are you from originally?\" as origin. These questions are further categorized into 66 primary and 19 follow-up questions based on content and order. For a complete list of the questions, please refer to Table  5 . Finally, we systematically tag each question based on its hierarchical order, specifically when a follow-up question follows a primary question or when a follow-up question follows a previous follow-up question. For instance, where the question sequence is \"What did you study at school?\", \"Are you still working in that?\", and \"How hard is that?\", the hierarchical order would be primary -follow-up -follow-up.\n\nAn overall process of hierarchical question embedding is depicted in Figure  3 . Interview sequences are represented as unimodal raw sequences 𝑋 𝑚 , where 𝑚 denotes 𝑚𝑜𝑑𝑎𝑙𝑖𝑡𝑦 ∈ {𝑎, 𝑣, 𝑡 }, respectively. Sequences 𝑋 𝑚 are partitioned into segments 𝑆 = {𝑠 𝑖 } 𝑛 𝑖=1 based on question and answer boundaries. Note that the number of segments, 𝑛, may vary for each sample due to differences in the type and number of questions employed during each interview. Then, each segment is split into a question segment and an answer segment;\n\nAfter partitioning, segments are labeled with topic codes corresponding to each question and given hierarchical position embeddings based on their relationships. Specifically, as shown in Figure  3 , we assign the previous question's Topic id to the follow-up question. These hierarchical positions are incorporated into the representation before feeding them into the model. This embedding process ensures uniform vector shapes by replacing unused questions with zero vectors, resulting in 85-dimensional representations for all samples.",

Specifically, in this case, the input sequences are cropped from the beginning of the utterance to the end of the interview conversation. When only Q.E is applied, the interview is segmented into question-answer pairs. Notably, this procedure only divides the sequence into questions and aligns them with the respective question topics without incorporating hierarchical positional embedding. The improvement presented in Table  4  highlights that, for depression detection with clinical interviews, extracting useful information based on a question-driven approach is more effective than considering the entire interview sequence as a single sequence. In the last scenario H.Q.E, hierarchical position embedding is introduced following the question embedding procedure. To elaborate, after dividing the interview into question-answer pairs using question embedding, a hierarchical relationship (primary or follow-up) among the questions is tagged through hierarchical position embedding. As shown in Table  4 , our proposed hierarchical question embedding process effectively forces the model to capture hierarchical relationships and the importance of the questions.",

      "text": "To assess the effectiveness of each layer in the HiQuE, we conducted an ablation study on the Question-Aware Module Layer and the Cross-Modal Attention Layer. As shown in Table  4 , without \"Q-A Module Layer\", each audio, visual, and text representation undergoes hierarchical question embedding and feature extraction processes before entering the Cross-Modal Attention Layer, which incorporates bidirectional cross-attention (e.g.,    4 , the setting without \"Q-A Module Layer\" achieves a higher macro average F1-score and weighted average F1-score compared to the setting without \"C-M Attention Layer\". This reveals that in detecting depression, it is more important to learn relevant information and interactions between modalities than to analyze the relationships and importance of each question. Furthermore, Table  4  also presents the performances of our proposed model with and without data augmentation. The results confirm that data augmentation enhances performance by balancing the sizes of depression and non-depression cases in the training set.",

      "text": "In this section, we present a case study on samples from our test set to assess the effectiveness of the decision-making process of HiQuE. Specifically, we examine the verbal (i.e., text) and non-verbal (i.e., audio and video) signals for the two cases: a depressed individual (381P) and a non-depressed individual (470P). Our analysis focuses on the distinct attributes of audio, text, and visual attention scores for each individual. For a fair comparison, we apply a normalization technique to the amplitude and time of the audio waves, allowing for unbiased and consistent analysis and comparison.\n\nFigure  6  showcases how the model integrates text, audio, and visual features during the decision-making process for each questionnaire response. In the case of the primary question \"What's one of your most memorable experiences?\", we observe that the depressed individual faces difficulties in providing a prompt response. He/she exhibits hesitation while reflecting on memorable experiences and ultimately struggles to provide a specific answer. In contrast, the non-depressed individual is more likely to respond immediately and accurately.\n\nBy analyzing audio, visual, and text attention scores to the followup question \"Can you tell me about that?\", we observe the comprehensive exploration and understanding of various responses exhibited by HiQuE in detecting depression. In the case of a nondepressed individual (470P), detailed explanations, expressions of excitement, and smiling faces are evident in the answer to the follow-up question. Note that HiQuE also gives the highest attention score 0.6 to visual features. Furthermore, apart from <laughter>, the audio waves display symmetrical patterns without irregular fluctuations, indicating a more wide range of tones and amplitudes. On the other hand, the depressed individual (381P) encounters difficulties recalling memorable experiences when responding to the follow-up question. Instead of positive recollections, this individual shares memories of regrettable past incidents. By examining the audio wave of the depressed individual, we observe unstable fluctuations in amplitude while his/her facial expressions remain neutral. For this reason, HiQuE assigns the highest attention score of 0.5 to text features, followed by attention scores of 0.3-0.4 for audio features.\n\nOur analysis of the attention scores for each modality during the model's diagnostic process demonstrates that HiQuE effectively incorporates the interview structure through its hierarchical question embedding layer. The case study provides further evidence that HiQuE successfully captures the sequential information of all questions and maximizes the mutual information between modalities by leveraging the question-aware module and the cross-modal attention layer.",

      "text": "In this paper, we presented HiQuE, a novel hierarchical question embedding model for multimodal depression detection. HiQuE efficiently captures the hierarchical structure of questions in clinical interviews and explores the correlations between different modalities to extract valuable information for depression detection. Through a comprehensive case study, we confirmed that the HiQuE focuses on questions specifically related to depression and makes its final decision by utilizing attention scores. This approach allows the model to mimic the expertise of clinical professionals during clinical interviews, where the interaction of questionnaire responses plays a crucial role. Given HiQuE's demonstrated generalizability to unseen questions, future plans involve extending its applicability to additional speech-related tasks and exploring the advantages of hierarchical question embedding further. who's someone that's been a positive influence in your life Primary  (10)  how would your best friend describe you Primary  (11)  what are some things you don't really like about l_a Primary  (12)  what did you study at school Primary  (13)  is there anything you regret Primary  (14)  what's your dream job Primary  (15)  what do you enjoy about traveling Primary  (16)  what are you like when you don't sleep well Primary  (17)  what's one of your most memorable experiences Primary  (18)  tell me about the hardest decision you've ever had to make Primary  (19)  what are some things you like to do for fun Primary  (20)  tell me about a situation that you wish you had handled differently Primary  (21)  tell me about an event or something that you wish you could erase from your memory Primary  (22)  why did you move to l_a Primary  (23)  what are some things you wish you could change about yourself Primary  (24)  what would you say are some of your best qualities Primary  (25)  how often do you go back to your home town Primary  (26)  how long ago were you diagnosed Primary  (27)  what's something you feel guilty about Primary  (28)  when did you move to l_a Primary  (29)  how easy was it for you to get used to living in l_a Primary  (30)  when was the last time you felt really happy Primary  (31)  what's the hardest thing about being a parent Primary  (32)  do you still go to therapy now Primary  (33)  do you travel a lot Primary  (34)  have you ever served in the military Primary  (35)  when was the last time that happened Primary  (36)  what's the best thing about being a parent Primary  (37)  what are some things that make you really mad Primary  (38)  do you find it easy to be a parent Primary  (39)  what do you do now Primary  (40)  what were your symptoms Primary  (41)  tell me how you spend your ideal weekend Primary  (42)  what do you do when you are annoyed Primary  (43)  tell me about your kids Primary  (44)  tell me about a time when someone made you feel really badly about yourself Primary  (45)  what are some ways that you're different as a parent than your parents Primary  (46)  what do you think of today's kids Primary  (47)  do you feel down Primary  (48)  how do you like your living situation Primary  (49)  how are you doing today Primary  (50)  do you have roommates Primary  (51)  do you think that maybe you're being a little hard on yourself Primary  (52)  do you have disturbing thoughts Primary  (53)  where do you live Primary  (54)  what did you do after the military Primary  (55)  did you ever see combat Primary  (56)  why don't we talk about that later Primary  (57)  how did serving in the military change you Primary  (58)  have you noticed any changes in your behavior or thoughts lately Primary  (59)  have you been diagnosed with depression Primary  (60)  how easy is it for you to get a good night sleep Primary  (61)  how close are you to your family Primary  (62)  how have you been feeling lately Primary  (63)  do you consider yourself an introvert Primary  (64)  have you ever been diagnosed with p_t_s_d Primary  (65)  do you feel like therapy is useful Primary  (66)  what do you do to relax Primary  (67)  can you tell me about that Follow-up  (68)  why Follow-up  (69)  how hard is that Follow-up  (70)  what made you decide to do that Follow-up  (71)  are you still doing that Follow-up  (72)  what got you to seek help Follow-up  (73)  how do you cope with them Follow-up  (74)  how does it compare to l_a Follow-up  (75)  are you okay with this Follow-up  (76)  are they triggered by something Follow-up  (77)  are you happy you did that Follow-up  (78)  could you have done anything to avoid it Follow-up  (79)  has that gotten you in trouble Follow-up  (80)  how do you know them Follow-up  (81)  do you feel that way often Follow-up  (82)  did you think you had a problem before you found out Follow-up  (83)  why did you stop Follow-up  (84)  what's it like for you living with them Follow-up  (85)  can you give me an example of that Follow-up\n\n[8] Tadas Baltrusaitis, Peter Robinson, and Louis-Philippe Morency. 2013.
