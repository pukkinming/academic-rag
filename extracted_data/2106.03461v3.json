      "text": "Electroencephalogram (EEG) based emotional analysis has been employed in medical science, security and human-computer interaction with good success. In the recent past, deep learning-based approaches have significantly improved the classification accuracy when compared to classical signal processing and machine learning based frameworks. But most of them were subject-dependent studies which were not able to generalize on the subject-independent tasks due to the inter-subject variability present in EEG data. In this work, a novel deep learning framework capable of doing subject-independent emotion recognition is presented, consisting of two parts. First, an unsupervised Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) with channel-attention autoencoder is proposed for getting a subject-invariant latent vector subspace i.e., intrinsic variables present in the EEG data of each individual. Secondly, a convolutional neural network (CNN) with attention framework is presented for performing the task of subject-independent emotion recognition on the encoded lower dimensional latent space representations obtained from the proposed LSTM with channel-attention autoencoder. With the attention mechanism, the proposed approach could highlight the significant time-segments of the EEG signal, which contributes to the emotion under consideration as validated by the results. The proposed approach has been validated using publicly available datasets for EEG signals such as DEAP dataset, SEED dataset and CHB-MIT dataset. With the proposed methodology, average subject independent accuracies of 65.9%, 69.5% for valence and arousal classification in the DEAP dataset and 76.7% for positive-negative classification in SEED dataset are obtained. Further for the CHB-MIT dataset, average subject independent accuracies of 69.1%, 67.6%, 72.3% for Pre-Ictal Vs Ictal, Inter-Ictal Vs Ictal, Pre-Ictal Vs Inter-Ictal classification are obtained, which are state-of-the-art to the best of our knowledge. The proposed end-to-end deep learning framework removes the requirement of different hand engineered features and provides a single comprehensive task agnostic EEG analysis tool capable of performing various kinds of EEG analysis on subject independent data.",

      "text": "Emotions, which are at the core of who we are, are linked to our thoughts, decision-making abilities, and cognitive processes. Research on emotional states can improve existing brain computer interface (BCI) frameworks, which can then be used to implement treatments for disorders such as autism spectrum disorder (ASD), attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), and anxiety disorder  [1] -  [3] . Recognition and interpretation of emotional states has always been a significant research subject in the fields of biological science, psychiatry, cognitive science, and brain-driven artificial intelligence because of these important applications  [4] -  [6] .\n\nSeveral methods have been developed for emotion recognition which includes the use of both physiological and non-physiological signals. Non-physiological signals include facial expressions, voice signals, body gestures while physiological signals include electroencephalogram (EEG), electrocardiogram (ECG) signals and many more. While using non-physiological signals is simple and does not require any special equipment, such signals may be forged and therefore are not considered to be a true reflection of one's emotional state. Physiological signals, on the other hand, are difficult to be manipulated and hence more suited to accurate emotion recognition tasks  [7] . Among the many physiological signals used to recognize emotions, EEG has gotten a lot of attention as it has the capability of capturing the brain state in real time with a high time resolution  [8] ,  [9] .\n\nVarious studies have been done in the past that have specifically handled emotion recognition through physiological signals and predominantly EEG as in  [9] -  [24] . Algorithms using power spectral density (PSD)  [10] -  [12] , sample entropy (SE)  [13] , differential entropy (DE)  [9] ,  [56] , wavelet transform (WT)  [14]  and several other methods have been used for extracting meaningful features from the EEG data. However, these model driven approaches try to approximate the EEG signals to a well-defined structured linear model and hence may not capture the non-linear statistics in the data. Majority of the state of the art models recently use machine learning based classifiers like  [15] -  [22] , PSD features with Naive Bayes classifiers in  [10] ,  [11] , PSD and statistical features with ontological models in  [17] , deep belief network (DBN) based features with support vector machine (SVM) in  [18] , power spectral and statistical features with neural networks in  [19] , features extracted using pyramidal convolutional neural network or autoencoders with fully connected networks as classifiers in  [20] -  [22] . Frequency domain-based feature extraction methods like short-time-Fourier transform (STFT)  [23]  and discrete wavelet transform (DWT)  [14] ,  [24]  have also been used before. The integration of signal processing and machine learning techniques has really helped in improving the results and the understanding of the emotion recognition task, but there still exists some major problems in most of the studies such as, using handcrafted features (leading to overfit) and poor generalization of the classifier model across subjects. Due to limitations of data in the medical field, it is difficult to get large, labeled dataset suitable for supervised learning techniques, thus the development of unsupervised learning techniques  [25]  is gaining significance. Thus, a new domain of subject-independent emotion recognition has been emerging recently where \"leave one subject out\" for validation is followed, a comprehensive review of the previous works in this domain can be found in Table  1 . A more detailed review of the recent state-of-the-art works in both subject-dependent and independent emotion recognition domain can be found in  [67] . In this research work we expanded on the results of previous studies in this area, based on the hypothesis that even among different individuals the basis of the neural networks formed in the brain while experiencing similar emotions remain the same  [25] -  [27] . One of the most significant components in any EEG analysis task is the accurate and compact low dimensional space (latent space) representation of the multichannel EEG signals. Autoencoders are found to be superior when compared with other nonlinear methods for finding the compact latent space representation of the given data. Generally other nonlinear dimensionality reduction    [10]  and SEED  [35]  dataset X. Li et al.  [22]  Autoencoder based features Long-Short-Term-Memory DEAP  [10]  and SEED  [35]  dataset J.

      "text": "Stratified Normalization SEED  [35]  dataset methods rely on a single property like distance or topology which is not the case with autoencoders  [28] . The overall proposed architecture is illustrated in Fig.  1 . Attention mechanisms help in modeling dependencies without having the constraint of far distances in the sequence in contrast to CNN's which have localized networks and sequencing networks such as long short-term memory (LSTM) which do not have a good memory retaining capacity  [29] -  [32] . Therefore, our main contributions include the following aspects:\n\n• A novel unsupervised LSTM with channel-attention autoencoder for getting the subject-invariant lower dimensional latent space representation of the EEG data where a similar representation space for different individuals is retrieved, thus alleviating the bottleneck created by the inter-subject variability of EEG data for subject-independent studies. • A novel CNN with attention framework for performing the task of subject-independent EEG emotion recognition by combining the usage of autoencoder for getting the lower dimensional latent space representation of EEG data, the CNN with attention framework is also capable of identifying key time frames in the EEG signal in an unsupervised manner while the model learns to classify the signal under supervision. • A thorough investigation of the temporal localization of emotional outbursts and of finding common latent vector subspaces irrespective of subjectivity of EEG data is performed. • Investigation of the efficacy of the proposed model in a completely different classification setting (e.g., knowing the scope of the usage of the proposed architecture outside the emotion recognition domain). Towards this, the proposed model architecture is tested on the Children's Hospital Boston and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology Dataset (CHB-MIT) dataset  [33]  for epileptic seizure detection. As mentioned in some recent research papers  [34] , a seizure can be stimulated due to intense emotions and especially stress. The rest of the paper is organized as follows: section two discusses the datasets employed and related methodology. The third section gives the comprehensive experimental results of the proposed algorithm and comparison algorithms followed by the fourth section on discussion and analysis of the proposed algorithm and results. The fifth section provides a conclusion to the paper.",

The working of LSTM revolves around the various gates that are inside it i.e., forget gate (𝑓 𝑡 ), input gate (𝑖 𝑡 ), cell gate (𝑐 𝑡 ) and output gate (𝑜 𝑡 ). In this work, we have used an LSTM with attention autoencoder architecture. LSTM's ability of taking the sequence and then encode the features of the data ensuring the temporal dependency, helps in better encoding\n\n(5)  (6)  of the data. This is because, in LSTM, the hidden states and cell states from the previous timesteps are shared with the current timestep as shown in  (7) .\n\nIn this work, to make the encodings by the LSTM autoencoder more robust, an attention layer  [31] ,  [32]  is proposed in the encoder block. The attention is applied on the channel dimension of the EEG data, which helps in placing similar channel encodings closer in the latent space. The added attention layer also facilitates the decoding process and helps in giving better reconstruction of the signal input (𝑥 𝑡 ). For maintaining the timesteps dimension, channel-attention was applied such that the output of the SoftMax was just scaled over all the hidden states and the summation step was omitted in contrast to  (3) . The architecture of the proposed approach is as shown in Fig.  2 (b) .\n\nFor increasing the feature extraction capability of the autoencoder, additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN) was added to the input, such that signal-to-noise ratio becomes unity. The autoencoder is trained such that it takes noisy data as the input and generates (decodes) the clean data as the output  [41] .

The proposed architecture is the combination of embeddings from language models (ELMo)  [47]  inspired character CNN with a highway network  [48]  and an additional attention mechanism at the end which will summarize the temporal direction (time series axis), as illustrated in Fig.  3 . A fully connected layer is added at the end for getting the number of classification classes. The CNN is formed by concatenating two convolutional blocks each capturing different aspects of the data i.e., the first convolutional block is designed such that it captures the nearby relationships, and the second convolutional block is designed such that it captures the long-range relationships. The first convolutional block contains a single convolutional layer, and the second convolutional block contains two convolutional layers, each convolutional layer (  8 ) is followed by an instance normalization layer  [43]  (Eq. 9, where 𝜇 𝑖𝑐 and 𝜎 𝑖𝑐 are the mean and standard deviation of the data along batch 𝑖 and channel c), a parametric rectified linear unit (PReLU) activation  [44]    (10) , and a dropout layer. Before concatenating the two convolutional blocks they are first passed through a max pooling layer. To ease the gradient-based training of deep neural networks the convolutional features are passed through a highway network architecture  [48]  which learn to regulate the flow of information through a network by using gating units, as shown in Fig.  4 . Finally, for getting a summarization of the time-axis, half of the features (ℎ 𝑡 1 ̂) from the highway network output is passed through a SoftMax activation layer  (11)  which acts as attention mechanism for the rest of the features  [31] ,  [32] ,  [42]  (12) as detailed in Fig.  3 .\n\nWhere, ℎ 𝑡 2 ̂ is the second half of the features from the highway network output and 𝑎 is the SoftMax of the first half of the features (ℎ 𝑡 1 ̂).

      "text": "To determine the exact instance of the onset of emotion after applying a stimulus, an analysis of the trained attention weights from the CNN with attention framework used for classification has been done. On analyzing the activation values for the DEAP dataset, we found a huge difference in the activation values of the neural network before and after the attention layer. It was interesting to note that, after the attention layer, the regions of high activation for each individual occurred over short time bursts. This observation aligns with the findings in emotion research suggesting that emotions are not continually represented in the brain but , ut outbursts of activations take place over a few short time segments  [57] . The visualization of these findings for the DEAP dataset can be seen in Fig.  5 . To the best of our knowledge, this is the first attempt to localize the emotion to exact time duration in the EEG signal computationally. Furthermore, we also analyzed the trained attention weights from the CNN classifier trained for recognition of an ictal epileptic state in the EEG data provided by the CHB-MIT dataset. The EEG input signal consisting of the three epileptic stages and the corresponding activation values is shown in Fig.  6 . As can be seen in the figure, on the onset of the ictal state the activation values of the neurons start firing up. So, from this observation we can say that the proposed CNN with attention classifier learns to correctly identify the important time segments in the EEG signal in an unsupervised manner while the model learns to classify the signal under supervision. Thus, this makes the proposed CNN with attention classifier a very potent tool for classifying EEG signals along with also identifying the key time frames responsible for enabling the particular classification.",

These techniques in a way help in dimensionality reduction for convenient and better visualization. It is well known that there is a significant variation between the patterns of EEG data obtained from different individuals while experiencing the same emotion. This subjectivity and variability in EEG data often lead to failure of generalization on data even by highly capable architectures. To understand this observation better, dimensionality reduction to 8 dimensions is performed on the 32-channel raw-EEG data provided in the DEAP dataset by using PCA and our proposed LSTM with channel-attention autoencoder for a few individuals. The results are illustrated in Fig.  7 , where each color represents the lower dimensional representation of an individual's data. The separation in the distribution of the lower dimensional representations for each individual is clearly evident from the PCA obtained plot, Fig.  7  (a). This also conveys that each individual exhibits or manifests emotion in a vividly different manner and thus the intrinsic variables in it cannot be captured using dimensionality reduction methods like PCA. In contrast to PCA, the lower dimensional representations obtained from the proposed LSTM with channel-attention autoencoder Fig.  7  (b). consists of much closer latent vector subspaces for different individuals, which symbolizes that the autoencoder was able to capture the intrinsic variables present in the EEG data. This observation shows that the proposed LSTM with channel-attention autoencoder is capable of learning subject-invariant latent vector subspaces i.e., intrinsic variables, for EEG data belonging to different individuals and break the barriers created by the subjectivity of EEG data.\n\nThus, this provides us with a useful tool for obtaining lower dimensional representation of EEG data on which any downstream task can be performed for analyzing the EEG data in a subject-independent manner.",

      "text": "It can be said that each human individual perceives emotions uniquely and the pattern of activity in different brain regions can be different too, as evident from Fig.  8 , where each individual is experiencing a happy emotion. So, we tried to investigate whether this different localization of EEG channels is preserved by the proposed LSTM with channel-attention autoencoder for different individuals. To do so, the most similar raw EEG channels are identified for each latent dimension obtained from the LSTM with channel-attention autoencoder using cosine similarity. It is observed that the highly activated latent dimensions were generally close to the highly activated raw EEG channels and the same was observed for the low activated regions. Thus, the conservation of localization of EEG channels for each individual in the latent dimensions obtained from the LSTM with channel-attention autoencoder is observed, but these observations need to be thoroughly validated through a larger dataset and various other",

      "text": "An end-to-end deep learning framework was proposed which first utilizes an LSTM with channel-attention autoencoder for encoding the input EEG signal such that a similar latent vector subspace is obtained for even different individuals as was seen in section 3.5. Then a CNN with attention classifier was used to classify the subject-invariant encodings obtained from the LSTM with channel-attention autoencoder into different labels for tasks like emotion recognition and epileptic seizure detection. Also, an approach to identify the important time segments in the EEG signal in an unsupervised manner was attempted as seen in section 3.6. Moreover, to show the characteristic of the proposed end-to-end deep learning framework to be application agnostic, it was trained to solve the task of epileptic seizure detection. To the best of our knowledge this was the first attempt towards showing application agnostic deep neural networks for EEG signals and the state-of-the-art results have been achieved on the CHB-MIT dataset with respect to subject-independent accuracy. As can be seen from Table  7 , most of the approaches in previous works  [51] [52] [53] [54] ,  [58]  heavily rely on hand-engineered features like differential entropy, statistical features, information potential and FAWT decompositions. These hand-engineered features can be very sensitive to the dynamics of the EEG signal such that the hand-engineered features which worked out for one task won't guarantee success with other tasks as the dynamics of EEG signals vary widely between different tasks. And, with the growing usage of automated systems for analysis of EEG signals it can become inefficient to find the appropriate signalprocessing/statistical analysis technique for feature extraction for every signal task. Thus, by the usage of deep learning-based architectures we can alleviate this problem as task dependent features can be learnt while training. But, in the case of \"leave-one subject out\", subject-independent EEG analysis, even the deep learning-based architectures can fail as the distribution of EEG data for each individual can form a separate cluster in the space as seen in Fig.  7  (a). To solve this problem, caused due to inter-subject variance of EEG data, we proposed a LSTM with channel-attention autoencoder capable of obtaining a subject-invariant latent vector subspace encoding for different individuals. The application of a LSTM with channel-attention type autoencoder is not only limited to retrieving subject-independent encodings but also has potential use in many neuroscience applications like analyzing EEG recordings from individuals suffering from diseases like Alzheimer's or Schizophrenia  [59] [60] [61] , where basic functional brain networks may have been disrupted. Furthermore, by the usage of emerging techniques for the analysis of the weights and activation values of the deep learning models we can attain more insights to the behavior of the input EEG signal with respect to time i.e., neuronal dynamics and investigate applications like identifying key timeframes with respect to the task being solved as showcased in section 3.6. Such applications can tremendously help clinicians by directly guiding them towards the important timeframes of lengthy EEG recording for further investigation. The proposed deep learning-based frameworks are relatively compact with respect to other popular deep learning models  [29] [30] ,  [45] [46]  but remain to be complex when compared with classical machine learning based approaches  [54] ,  [58]  which results in a higher training time. However, by parallelizing over GPUs, the inference time of the proposed end-to-end deep learning-based framework can be reduced significantly in comparison to non-parallelizable hand-engineered features that need to be extracted during the time of inference. The idea of building \"leave-one subject out\", subject-independent and application agnostic EEG analysis tools is a very promising one. Even though such approaches do not outperform hand-engineered features-based EEG analysis tools, they potentially do offer a lot more generalizability over hand-engineered algorithms with respect to inter-subject variance and application agnosticism. With further efforts in this direction, it may also outperform the hand-engineered features-based EEG analysis tools. More efforts towards the explainability of such subject-independent and application agnostic EEG analysis tools is also required in the direction of applications such as source imaging, time localization and neuronal dynamics, which was not completely achieved in the proposed research work due to absence of custom collected dataset.",

      "text": "In this paper, the task of obtaining subject-invariant latent representations of multichannel EEG signals is thoroughly investigated using autoencoder based architectures. This is further followed up by the usage of these latent vectors for performing classification tasks such as emotion recognition. Attention mechanism was an essential component in all our experimented architectures due to its ability to keep track of long-term dependencies in sequential data, which cannot be modelled by LSTM or CNN due to enormous length of EEG data. We performed subject-independent emotion recognition to show that the proposed methodology was able to generalize over the whole dataset i.e., SEED and DEAP Datasets, where competitive results were achieved in comparison to the previous state-of-the-art works in the subject-independent emotion recognition domain. The comprehensive scope of the proposed framework as an application agnostic EEG analysis tool is further demonstrated on a more immediate real-life application of epileptic seizure detection and key time frame identification using the CHB-MIT dataset, where we achieved state-of-the-art results. This shows that the proposed attention neural network-based methodology can be a promising approach for diagnosing and further helping people with diseases like Epilepsy and Alzheimer, where basic functional brain networks may have been disrupted. The efficacy of the proposed approach is further employed to localize the emotional burst in time and for finding common latent vector subspaces irrespective of subjectivity of EEG data, which opens a new paradigm for studying neuronal dynamics using EEG. Thus, with this research work we have taken a step towards developing application agnostic EEG analysis tools and aim to build more comprehensive and efficient tools in the future.",
