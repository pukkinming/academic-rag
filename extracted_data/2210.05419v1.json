Interaction and regulation are two essential factors related to the success of collaborative learning. Since the information from various modalities can reflect the quality of collaboration, a new multimodal dataset with cognitive and emotional triggers is introduced in this paper to explore how regulations affect interactions during the collaborative process. Specifically, a learning task with intentional interventions is designed and assigned to high school students aged 15 years old (N=81) in average. Multimodal signals, including video, Kinect, audio, and physiological data, are collected and exploited to study regulations in collaborative learning in terms of individual-participantsingle-modality, individual-participant-multiple-modality, and multiple-participant-multiple-modality. Analysis of annotated emotions, body gestures, and their interactions indicates that our multimodal dataset with designed treatments could effectively examine moments of regulation in collaborative learning. In addition, preliminary experiments based on baseline models suggest that the dataset provides a challenging in-the-wild scenario, which could further contribute to the fields of education and affective computing.",

      "text": "Collaborative learning is a social system in which groups of learners solve problems or construct knowledge by working together  [4] . Recent findings demonstrate that collaborative learning can promote higher-level thinking, oral communication, leadership skills, student-faculty interaction, and student responsibility  [40] . Although many factors can affect collaborative learning, social interaction has been considered one of the most important  [31, 38] . To succeed in collaboration, learners should actively exchange their ideas, experience, resources, skills, and feelings within a team  [35, 36] . According to the research on promises of interactivity  [36] , interactions enable collaborators to learn and encourage them to be focused, participative and dedicated to interchange ideas with each other. To this end, studying and promoting the interactions in a collaborative setting will provide valuable insight into the quality of collaboration and be significant and helpful in various fields, especially education research  [7] .\n\nThere is a growing interest in studying interactions in a collaborative learning context by utilizing emotional and physiological measures in recent years  [3, 4] . Thanks to the development of the hardware and AI technologies [  14-16, 20, 21] , it is convenient to unobtrusively and automatically capture the physiological and visual signals of team members, which makes it possible to study the correspondence between multimodal signals for observing interactive processes during collaborative learning.\n\nA variety of research has studied emotional interactions among learners  [3, 17] . The results have revealed that positive emotional interactions are related to better collaboration. However, previous studies only focus on the facial expressions and the physiological signals in interactions independently. Many studies illustrate that the body gesture can also provide emotional clues  [18, 22] , and body gestures in interactions can contribute to solving cooperation and collaborative problem  [5] . In this paper, we design a collaborative learning task and collect a multimodel dataset, including video, Kinect video, audio, and physiological data, to analyse collaborative learning interactions, as shown in Fig.  1 .\n\nAnother critical factor for successful learning is regulation  [9] . Socially shared regulation can promote productive collaborative learning. Thus, we introduce regulation processes in collaborative learning by designing interventions, i.e., the cognitive trigger and the emotional trigger in our task setting. Through analyzing different features such as emotional reflection during triggers, researchers can inspect whether and how those external events influence interactions of group members.\n\nIn this paper, a new dataset is collected in terms of multiple modalities to comprehensively explore the regulation of learning and the aroused emotional interactions in collaborative learning. As far as we know, this is the first multimodal dataset for studying regulation in collaborative learning with regulatory triggers. The main contributions are as follows:\n\n• We design a collaborative learning task with two kinds of triggers, i.e., cognitive and emotional triggers, to study the regulation inference in collaborative learning. • We collect a multimodal dataset consisting of video, Kinect, audio, and physiological data to analyse collaborative learning interctions.\n\n• Statistical analysis and baseline experiments demonstrate that the regulation significantly impacts interactions during the collaborative process.",

      "text": "Collaborative learning is an educational approach for enhanced learning  [7]  where two or more learners work together to solve problems, complete tasks, or learn new concepts. Learners work as a group rather than individually to obtain a complete understanding by interchanging their ideas, processing and synthesizing information instead of using rote memorization of texts  [35] . According to recent studies, collaborative learning can boost higher-level thinking, oral communications, leadership skills, student-faculty interactions, self-esteem and responsibility of students  [13] .\n\nVarious interactions emerging in the collaborative learning process are essential features of effective learning. Many researchers have studied emotional interactions in collaborative learning. Webb et al.  [42]  found that positive emotional interactions, like support and respect, are related to better collaboration. Dindar et al.  [3]  revealed that video-based facial emotion recognition helped explain social and affective dynamics in collaborative learning research. Besides emotions, physiological signals also serve crucial functions in studying collaborative processes  [4] . Several studies have investigated the interaction in collaborative learning by identifying the synchronizing extent of physiological signals  [3] . Additional work verified that gestures served a variety of signalling functions in collaborative problem-solving communication and had a diagnostic role for team members  [5, 34] .\n\nDue to the contribution of different modalities, existing research has focused on studying the collaborative learning process by exploring multimodal signals  [25, 33] . Nguyen et al.  [25]  developed a deep learning model to automatically detect interaction types for regulations in collaborative learning by analyzing electrodermal activities (EDA), video, and audio data. Reilly et al.  [33]  studied the Kinect and speech data and demonstrated how specific movements and gestures positively correlate with collaboration and learning gains. Unlike previous methods introducing only two or three modalities, in this paper, we collected a multimodal dataset including facial video, audio, gesture, EDA, heart rate (HR), and accelerometer to explore the collaborative process comprehensively.",

      "text": "Recent research has highlighted the importance of co-regulation and socially shared regulation of learning to the group's collaborative learning success  [23] . While self-regulated learning depicts the individual process of monitoring, reflecting, and correcting one's emotion, motivation, and cognition towards attaining learning goals, co-regulation and socially shared regulation refer to this process in collaborative learning at the group level  [47] . Co-regulation of learning relates to the co-operation of regulation in which self-regulated learning occurs with support from another learner. However, socially shared regulation of learning involves learners in a group interdependently regulating the group's collaborative learning process and jointly regulating individual learning processes through social interactions  [6] . Therefore, besides multiple modalities, we also study regulation in collaborative learning tasks by introducing designed interventions.",

      "text": "There are currently various multimodal datasets used for studying emotion and gesture in collaborative learning. CMU Multimodal Opinion Sentiment and Emotion Intensity (CMU-MOSEI) dataset  [43]  contains more than 23,500 sentence utterance videos from online YouTube speakers. It has three modalities: language, visual, and acoustic, annotated for six basic emotions and five sentiments. The EmoReact Dataset  [27]  is a multimodal emotion dataset of children which contains 1102 audio-visual clips of 17 different emotional states: six basic emotions, neutral, valence, and nine complex emotions, including uncertainty, curiosity, and frustration. Moreover, the Persuasive Opinion Multimedia (POM) corpus  [29]  consists of 1,000 movie review videos obtained from a social multimedia website. This dataset includes three modalities, video, text, and acoustic, and annotates for multiple speaker traits. Although the above multimodal datasets are compatible for analyzing emotions in collaborative learning, they only consider individuals instead of interactions among multiple members in a group. Zhang et al.  [45]  proposed a dataset studying the social relation between two or more people in one image or video. Alternatively, Kosti et al.  [12]  presented the EMOTIC dataset that involved scene context in addition to facial expression and body pose for extra information on emotion perception. However, these datasets only consider the visual modality and aim to study social or semantic relations.\n\nBy contrast, our work establishes a multimodal dataset in collaborative learning scenario. It explores the interactions among group members and introduces regulations by designed interventions, which provides an interdisciplinary platform for studying emotion regulations and their impacts in collaborative learning.",

Two-meter COVID social distance was kept between participants during data collection.\n\nA 360 • camera (Insta360 Pro) that contains six camera spots and a microphone was placed in the center. The six cameras are hardware synchronized, and the grabbed frames from the six channels are used for building the whole environment in 360 degrees. During the collection, each participant was facing one camera directly. This way, we could have a compact frontal face for every participant, as shown in Fig.  2 . Resolutions of individual video and reconstructed video are 3840 x 2160 and 1920 x 960, respectively, with an average recording rate of 30 fps. Furthermore, a surveillance camera was applied to monitor and recall. Three individual microphones were employed to record the audio data.\n\nTwo Kinect cameras (Azure Kinect DK) were utilized to capture the gesture of the three participants. The two devices were denoted as 'Master Kinect' and 'Salve Kinect' and synchronized by a cable automatically. Its average fps was around 30. Five sensor streams are aggregated in the Kinect camera, including a depth camera, a color camera, an infrared camera, IMU (Inertial Measurement Unit) and microphones. The Azure Kinect Viewer can visualize all the streams, as shown in Fig.  3 (a) .\n\nPhysiological data, including EDA, HR, and accelerometer, were captured by Physiological sensors (Shimmer GSR3+) as shown in Fig.  3 (b) . All the signals were collected at the sampling rate of 128 Hz, which could be used to reveal new insights into the emotional and cognitive processes in collaborative learning regulation  [4] .   Although the above multimodal data offers promising capabilities for analysis, the synchronization of multiple modalities collected from different channels is usually challenging in both methodological and theoretical aspects.\n\nIn order to reach the finest granularity synchronization possible, the data synchronization was planned before the official collection in which each data collection device clock was synchronized to record Unix timestamp. The real-time timestamps were then used for data synchronization. The audio and video metadata were tracked with device-recorded Unix timestamps, while every record of physiological data was also associated with a specific Unix timestamp. Finally, the Kinect data was synchronized with physiological data by the frame change of the video played during the introduction of the collaborative tasks.",

Second, ten annotators worked independently after a preparatory course. Each annotator was required to annotate three trigger clips.

The Happy is mapped to Positive; the Sad, Surprise, Fear, Anger; and Contempt are mapped to Negative. In this case, the EmoNet5, EmoNet8, and Emotion-GCN achieve an accuracy of 51%, 48%, and 35%, respectively. The EmoNet outperforms Emotion-GCN, and the EmoNet5 achieves the best performance. One possible reason is that our dataset is in-the-wild and has various head poses and occlusions.\n\nThe EmoNet aggregated face-alignment task can alleviate head poses and occlusions to some extent. Among the three emotions, we observe that Negative gets the best performance, as shown in the confusion matrix in Fig.  7 , while Neutral is easy to misclassify to Negative. This phenomenon might be caused by significant face deformation because participants always look down at the laptop screen during the learning procedure. In general, the results suggest that the collected in-the-wild dataset of collaborative learning has head pose and face occlusion factors, which could be challenging in the facial expression recognition task.\n\nIn addition, We compare the valence with the emotion value reported in the self-reports to validate the continuous emotion. At the end of data collection, the participants were asked to watch the recorded video during the trigger clips and report their emotions when the trigger happened. Since they tend to report the emotions at the highest intensity after hearing the trigger, the predicted valence at the highest arousal after the trigger in 10s was compared with the self-reported valence. The average L1 norm distance between predicted and self-reported valence is 0.44, 0.44, and 0.46 on EmoNet5, EmoNet8, and Emotion-GCN. The results further indicate that the EmoNet based on face-alignment task have strength with the in-the-wild situation with various head poses and occlusions.\n\nManuscript submitted to ACM Fig.  8 .

The correlation coefficient (𝑟 𝑠 ) can take values from +1 to -1, which indicates a perfect positive (+1) or negative (-1) association of ranks.\n\nTab. 2 shows the correlation coefficient (𝑟 𝑠 ) and two-tailed significance value (𝜌-value) of Spearman's rank-order correlation between paired emotions during different triggers.

      "text": "This paper introduces a novel multimodal dataset specifically designed to study regulation in collaborative learning.\n\nThe dataset of collaborative learning groups contains 81 video clips from individual learners, which are annotated for three emotion labels around the intervention events, 28 360-stitched videos for learning groups, 18 Kinect depth sensor videos, and 66 128 Hz physiological signals. We respond to the recent calls to utilize multimodal data and advanced machine learning technologies to reveal the \"unobservable\" emotional and cognitive processes in collaborative learning and the induced regulation  [8, 26] . This paper also demonstrates a interdisciplinary approach with multimodal data to examine interactions for regulation in collaborative learning.\n\nConsistent with the literature  [25, 26] , according to the data annotation and emotion evaluation on the video data, we found that facial expression recognition with in-the-wild interaction situations is challenging due to the head poses, occlusions, and non-emotional facial movements like talking  [19] . As a result, novel methods such as more robust facial expression recognition algorithms are needed to be developed in the future. However, since learning regulation may rarely occur through interactions in collaborative learning  [28] , existing datasets on collaborative learning would not be sufficient to develop such methods specifically for examining the regulation of learning. Accordingly, the contribution of this study has been to provide a multimodal dataset with designed interventions for regulation in collaborative learning. This dataset has significant implications for further methodological development and theoretical advancement in researching, understanding, and supporting regulation in collaborative learning. Another substantial contribution of this study relates to the interdisciplinary approach with preliminary results to examine the utility of the proposed dataset. Our results reported a significant difference in emotion distribution among different interventions to trigger regulation in collaborative learning. Our findings support previous learning sciences research of regulation in collaborative learning  [37] . It demonstrates that the learning regulation is a temporal, cyclical, and dynamic process, and such external events would dynamically influence students' learning interactions. Our results also indicate that positive emotions are associated with positive empathy and better interaction. However, the gesture interaction has dynamic performance during different regulatory moments. In line with previous studies  [4] , our results reveal that emotions aroused by the regulation of learning are displayed in multimodal emotional behaviors.\n\nOur interdisciplinary approach in this presented study also responds to the recent calls for interdisciplinary effort bridging learning sciences, machine learning, and affective computing to maximize the impact of multimodal data and advanced techniques in examining and supporting regulation in collaborative learning (  [8, 26] . This paper contributes to both the field of computer sciences by offering a novel dataset for multimodal model development and to the field of learning sciences by providing new insights into the trigger moments for regulation in collaborative learning.",

      "text": "Since this is a preliminary study of multimodal analysis for collaborative learning, several limitations should be addressed in our future work. One thing is the insufficient annotated data. We only annotated the clips around triggers as a test set of the collected dataset for experiments in this paper. More labeled clips with discrete and dimensional emotions should be considered for a systematic analysis. Besides, instead of directly using pre-trained models, new methods need to be designed for robust emotion recognition in collaborative learning.\n\nOn the other hand, the interaction analysis is mainly based on the correlation among individual facial expressions and gestures. High-level interaction annotations, such as eye contact, should be further considered. Another limitation is that this work only analyzes interactions influenced by triggers. The relationship between emotions and self-regulated learning should be further explored. Finally, multiple modalities, including facial behavior, physiological signal, and gestures, will be integrated and studied for a comprehensive understanding of collaborative learning.",
