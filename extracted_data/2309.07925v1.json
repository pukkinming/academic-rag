      "text": "Multimodal emotion recognition (MER) plays a crucial role in natural human-machine interaction  [25, 30] , intelligent education tutoring  [23, 24] , and mental health diagnoses  [16, 32] , etc. In our daily life, when we engage in dialogue and communication, we usually convey our emotions through both verbal and non-verbal content, such as facial expressions and body language  [26] . Previous studies focused on emotion recognition in text  [12, 34] , facial expression  [26, 36]  and audio  [17, 27] . However, it has been observed that research on single-modality approaches has reached a certain bottleneck, thereby leading to increased attention toward the use of multimodal approaches  [3, 9, 14, 18] .\n\nRegarding human communication scenarios, emotions are mainly expressed through speech and facial expressions, each providing complementary information. As a result, researchers are dedicated to fusing audio and video modal features  [10, 22, 37, 38] . For example, Han et al.  [10]  proposed a hierarchical approach that maximized the Mutual Information (MI) among unimodal inputs. Hazarika et al.  [22]  projected each modality to modality-invariant and modalityspecific spaces to learn effective representations. Recently, inspired by the success of pre-trained deep features like wav2vec2.0  [1]  and HUBURT  [13]  in other speech-related tasks, some researchers investigate their superiority over hand-engineered features in speech emotion recognition and discovered that these deep features capture more robust acoustic representations  [4, 15, 31, 33] .\n\nAccording to the theory of psychological research, there are two main emotional calculation models: discrete theory and dimensional theory. Discrete theory  [7]  describes emotional states as discrete labels such as \"sad\" and \"happy\". On the other hand, the theory of dimensionality  [8]  suggests that emotional states exist as points in a continuous space. This allows for simulating subtle, complex, and sustained emotional behaviors. Previous studies have found that there exists a strong correlation between these two models  [5, 31] .  In this paper, we propose an efficient multimodal emotion recognition system to recognize both discrete emotion (emotion) and dimensional emotion (valence). Firstly, we extract deep features through different layers of various pre-trained models as robust acoustic and visual representations of raw video segments. Then we fuse these features through three proposed feature fusion structures based on AFG  [20] . Afterwards, we have designed a joint decoding module that considers both discrete and dimensional theories based on the correlation between emotion and valence to generate decisions for these two dimensions. A multi-task loss function based on uncertainty  [6]  is also designed to optimize the whole encoding and decoding process. Finally, we generate final predictions of both discrete and dimensional emotions by decision-level fusion. We evaluate the proposed framework on the dataset of the multimodal emotion recognition challenge (MER 2023)  [19] . Experiments show that our framework yields consistent improvements on both emotion classification and valence regression and ranks third on the leaderboard on MER-MULTI sub-challenge.",

      "text": "In our proposed architecture, we first extract deep features from pre-trained models as robust acoustic and visual representations of raw video segments. The details are illustrated in Figure  1 . Previous research has indicated that different layers in pre-trained speech model HUBURT  [13]  capture audio hidden states with distinctive characteristics  [35] . The hidden states captured by layers closer to the front exhibit increased sensitivity to the acoustic features of the original audio, such as tone or frequency. In contrast, the hidden states captured by layers towards the back demonstrate a heightened sensitivity to the semantic information embedded within the audio. These different features with distinct acoustic information from the same audio segment can be complementary. Hence, for the acoustic modality, our framework incorporates different HUBURT layers to extract low-level, mid-level, and high-level audio features, forming a unified representation of the original audio. For visual modality, we first crop and align faces of raw video in each frame using the OpenFace  [2]  toolkit. Then, we utilize various pre-trained models (such as MANet  [21]  and ResNet-50  [11] ) to extract framelevel features and apply average encoding to compress them into video-level embeddings. Then, these different acoustic and visual representations will be fused together with deep feature fusion frameworks based on attention-guided feature gathering (AFG)  [20] . In addition, features of text modality, however, are proved to be underperforming comparing with acoustic and visual features in this task [19] so we do not take features from text encoders into consideration in our framework. The architecture of AFG module is shown in Figure  2 , whose principle is as follows:\n\nwhere 𝒉  Three different feature fusion frameworks have been designed based on AFG  [20] , as depicted in Figure  1 . In the first framework, we use AFG to fuse all features from acoustic and visual modalities in parallel. In the second framework, we fuse each acoustic representation with visual features to generate different audio-visual representations. These representations are then fused together, as they exhibit strong complementarity. While in the last framework, intra-modal fusion is firstly performed on the acoustic hidden states extracted by different layers of HUBURT  [13]  to create a unified acoustic representation, then inter-modal fusion is conducted based on the unified acoustic representation and visual representations.",

      "text": "In our studies, we found there exists a relatively stable distribution between discrete and dimensional emotions  [5, 31] . In other words, the discrete emotions can determine the dimensional emotions according to the following formula, where 𝑒 𝑖 represents discrete emotions while 𝑣 𝑖 represents dimensional emotions. 𝑘 represents categories of emotions.\n\nTherefore, our research incorporates a branch for discrete emotions judgment of dimensional emotions into the network structure. This branch establishes a mapping from the discrete space to the dimensional space, as depicted in Figure  3 . The prediction of discrete and dimensional emotions by our multi-task framework is as follows:\n\nwhere ĥ𝑖 ∈ R 𝐷 is the fused feature, ê𝑖 ∈ R 𝐶 and v𝑖 ∈ R 1 are the estimated emotion and valence possibilities, respectively. 𝑾 𝒆 ∈ R 𝐷 ×𝐶 , 𝒃 𝒆 ∈ R 𝐷 ×𝐶 , 𝑾 𝒗𝒗 ∈ R 2×1 and 𝒃 𝒗𝒗 ∈ R 2×1 are trainable parameters. ṽ𝑖 ∈ R and ṽ𝑖 𝑒 ∈ R are the estimated valence possibilities according to the fused state ĥ𝑖 and emotion hidden state ê𝑖 with trainable parameters 𝑾 𝒗 ∈ R 𝐷 ×1 , 𝒃 𝒗 ∈ R 𝐷 ×1 , 𝑾 𝒆𝒗 ∈ R 𝐶 ×1 and 𝒃 𝒆𝒗 ∈ R 𝐶 ×1 , as follows: ṽ𝑖 = ĥ𝑖 𝑾 𝒗 + 𝒃 𝒗 (7)\n\nDuring training, we use the cross-entropy (CE) loss as the classification loss, denoted as L 𝑒 , for emotion prediction. The mean squared error (MSE) loss is adopted for valence prediction, denoted as L 𝑣 . Moreover, we introduce dynamic weights to combine the two losses for better performance in the multi-task learning process.\n\nInspired by the Uncertainty loss  [6] , we introduce uncertainty loss weighting to L 𝑒 and L 𝑣 , whose principle is as follows:\n\nwhere 𝛿 1 and 𝛿 2 are trainable uncertainty weights. We improved the regular loss term to log(1 + 𝛿 1 ) and log(1 + 𝛿 2 ) to avoid effects caused by enormous negative weights.",

For the visual modality, we perform various image transformations to augment the data, including variations in brightness (e.g., solarize), changes in articulation (e.g., blur), alterations in position (e.g., rotate), and modifications in image content (e.g., cutout). We also conduct decision-level fusion on predictions of multimodal emotion recognition systems with three fusion strategies.

We conduct both intra-modal and inter-modal fusion. Three fusion strategies are conducted separately in inter-modal fusion. Then, the baseline[19] and the proposed joint decoding manner are utilized separately to obtain predictions for emotion and valence. The results are shown in Table  1 .\n\nThe results indicate that features from different layers of the same model can be complementary, as the fusion metric improves by 1-2 percent points comparing with single-layer feature. Furthermore, the results demonstrate that incorporating features from different modalities significantly improves performance. The final multimodal system achieves a score of 0.6846 tested on MER-MULTI, which is a 16.6 percent improvement to the unimodal system. Interestingly, we observed a significant gain on MSE loss for dimensional emotion regression when utilizing JDEV. This phenomenon suggests that the relatively reliable results of emotion classification can assist in improving the accuracy of dimensional valence regression by joint decoding.\n\nAmong the three proposed fusion strategies, the parallel fusion strategy 1 achieves the highest metric of 0.6779 on MER-MULTI. Additionally, when combining all three strategies on posterior probability level, we obtain an additional score gain of 0.67 percent points when tested on MER-MULTI sub-challenge.",
