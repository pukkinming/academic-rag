      "text": "Road rage, often triggered by emotional suppression and sudden outbursts, significantly threatens road safety by causing collisions and aggressive behavior. Speech emotion recognition technologies can mitigate this risk by identifying negative emotions early and issuing timely alerts. However, current SER methods, such as those based on hidden markov models and Long short-term memory networks, primarily handle one-dimensional signals, frequently experience overfitting, and lack calibration, limiting their safety-critical effectiveness. We propose a novel risk-controlled prediction framework providing statistically rigorous guarantees on prediction accuracy. This approach employs a calibration set to define a binary loss function indicating whether the true label is included in the prediction set. Using a data-driven threshold β, we optimize a joint loss function to maintain an expected test loss bounded by a user-specified risk level α. Evaluations across six baseline models and two benchmark datasets demonstrate our framework consistently achieves a minimum coverage of 1 -α, effectively controlling marginal error rates despite varying calibration-test split ratios (e.g., 0.1). The robustness and generalizability of the framework are further validated through an extension to small-batch online calibration under a local exchangeability assumption. We construct a non-negative test martingale to maintain prediction validity even in dynamic and non-exchangeable environments. Cross-dataset tests confirm our method's ability to uphold reliable statistical guarantees in realistic, evolving data scenarios.",

      "text": "In recent years, road rage has emerged as a growing global traffic safety concern. With rapid urbanization and increasing vehicle ownership, heightened traffic congestion and driving stress have led to a rise in extreme emotional responses among drivers. Empirical studies indicate that road rage not only contributes significantly to traffic accidents but also intensifies conflicts between drivers and other road users, thereby posing a serious threat to public safety. According to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA)  [1, 2] , over one-third of traffic accidents are associated with emotional loss of control by drivers-a proportion that continues to rise. Speech Emotion Recognition technology  [3, 4] , which identifies emotional states through the analysis of vocal signals, has increasingly been recognized as an effective approach to mitigating road rage and other emotion-induced driving risks.  [5]  By capturing vocal characteristics in real time and inferring the driver's emotional state, SER enables timely feedback to intelligent traffic management systems, facilitating the early detection and intervention of potentially hazardous driving behaviors. Beyond its applications in smart vehicles for precise emotion monitoring, SER has also shown promise in broader emotion-centric domains such as customer service and mental health assessment  [6, 7] . Given its cross-disciplinary relevance, SER is rapidly gaining traction as a core research focus in intelligent transportation systems, autonomous driving technologies, and affective computing.\n\nWith the rapid advancement of deep learning, speech emotion recognition based on convolutional neural networks (CNNs) has achieved notable success. In this study, we utilize Mel-spectrogram features to represent speech signals and differentiate among emotional categories through comparative experiments across models. Despite these advancements, CNN-based SER models remain susceptible to overfitting during training, leading to degraded generalization on previously unseen data.  [8, 9]  Moreover, most deep learning models lack inherent mechanisms to quantify predictive uncertainty, making their outputs potentially unreliable in real-world applications. Recent research has highlighted the issue of miscalibration: Although CNNs often achieve high classification accuracy in SER tasks, their prediction confidence tends to be overestimated. For instance, Zhao et al.  [10]  demonstrated that this overconfidence substantially increases the risk of misclassification, particularly for low-confidence samples. Thus, improving the uncertainty quantification of SER models has become essential to enhancing their reliability and robustness  [11] .\n\nTo address these challenges, Conformal Prediction (CP) provides a statistically rigorous framework for uncertainty quantification and prediction calibration  [12] . CP constructs prediction sets that are guaranteed to contain the true label with a user-defined confidence level, thus enhancing model trustworthiness in safety-critical applications. Our overall framework is illustrated in Figure  1 . In the context of SER  [13] , we extract Mel-spectrogram features and train five neural network architectures with comparable parameter sizes on the IEMOCAP dataset as base models. Following model training, the CP procedure is applied in three steps:  (1)  defining nonconformity scores for each prediction;\n\n(2) computing a calibration quantile q from a held-out calibration set based on a user-specified risk level α; and (3) generating prediction sets for test samples that satisfy the marginal coverage guarantee. By outputting emotion label sets with formal confidence guarantees, our approach establishes a principled statistical foundation for improving the reliability of speech emotion recognition systems.\n\nWhile conformal prediction provides formal coverage guarantees for prediction sets, it primarily focuses on marginal coverage and does not account for task-specific performance criteria. To address this limitation, the risk-controlled conformal prediction (RCCP) framework  [14]  extends traditional CP by bounding the expected value of arbitrary monotonic loss functions, thereby enabling principled risk management in complex real-world tasks. This generalization maintains statistical rigor while offering flexibility in defining application-specific loss metrics, making the approach broadly applicable across diverse domains. By combining CP with risk control, the framework preserves coverage guarantees while aligning predictions with user-defined performance requirements. However, conventional CP methods assume exchangeability among data points-a condition that holds in controlled environments but is frequently violated in real-world scenarios, such as speech emotion recognition, where data distributions often shift across speakers, sessions, or acoustic conditions. In such non-exchangeable settings, standard CP methods may fail to uphold their theoretical guarantees, thus compromising reliability. To address this challenge, we propose a novel framework that extends CP to dynamic, non-exchangeable environments via a mini-batch online calibration mechanism. Specifically, we relax the global exchangeability assumption by introducing a local exchangeability assumption within individual mini-batches. By constructing a non-negative test supermartingale, our method adaptively calibrates prediction sets in an online manner, ensuring valid coverage even under distributional shifts between batches-such as variations in speaker identity or environmental noise. This framework provides a statistically sound and practically robust solution for deploying CP-based uncertainty quantification in dynamic real-world SER applications.\n\nTo validate the effectiveness of our framework, we conducted a series of empirical studies. Preliminary evaluations on the TESS dataset compared multiple feature extraction methods, with Mel-spectrograms demonstrating superior performance and thus selected for downstream tasks. We then trained several neural network architectures (e.g., ResNet, MobileNetV3, ShuffleNetV2) on IEMOCAP, where a clear overfitting problem emerged, despite perfect training accuracy, test performance degraded significantly. To ensure prediction reliability, we integrated the CP framework, conducting both within-dataset and cross-dataset experiments. Results confirmed that CP consistently maintained desired coverage levels, even under data distribution shifts, highlighting its robustness. Moreover, we observed that prediction set size serves as an effective indicator of model uncertainty  [15] , prompting the use of a risk-controlled loss function to adaptively regulate prediction confidence. Finally, to address non-exchangeable settings, we introduced a mini-batch martingale-based calibration strategy. Experiments with mismatched calibration and test datasets (IEMOCAP to TESS) demonstrated that, unlike standard CP, our approach preserved high coverage under local exchangeability assumptions, confirming its practical utility in dynamic environments.      [18, 19] . In the context of speech emotion recognition, deep learning has similarly replaced hand-crafted feature engineering with automatic representation learning.  [20, 21]  As reviewed by Schuller  [22] , hybrid CNN-LSTM models now form the backbone of state-of-the-art SER systems, capable of capturing complex emotional nuances in speech data. Today, deep learning stands as the foundation of both speech recognition and emotion understanding, powering a wide range of applications from intelligent assistants to mental health monitoring.",

      "text": "Conformal Prediction  [23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28]  is an uncertainty quantification framework that offers finite-sample statistical guarantees for predictive models. Unlike traditional point predictions, CP outputs a prediction set-a subset of possible labels-that is guaranteed to contain the true label with a user-specified confidence level (e.g., 90%). The core idea of CP is to compute a nonconformity score that quantifies how unusual a predicted label is, given the model's behavior. For classification tasks, this score is often based on the model's confidence in the correct class (e.g., 1 minus the predicted probability of the true label); for regression, it typically corresponds to the absolute error between predicted and true values. During calibration, CP uses a held-out calibration set to estimate the distribution of nonconformity scores. A quantile threshold is then determined based on the desired coverage level. At test time, for each new input, the model evaluates nonconformity scores across candidate labels, and the prediction set includes all labels with scores below the calibrated threshold. Importantly, CP makes no assumptions about the underlying data distribution, requiring only that the calibration and test samples are exchangeable. This distribution-free property enables CP to provide reliable coverage guarantees across a wide range of models and applications.\n\n3 Method",

      "text": "In light of the limitations of traditional conformal prediction, which relies on global data exchangeability  [25, 29, 30] , we propose the assumption of within -batch local exchangeability. We prove that even when there are differences in data distributions between batches (i.e., batch -to -batch exchangeability may not hold), we can still strictly guarantee the global coverage probability by constructing a non -negative test supermartingale with a forcing operation. The framework is shown in the algorithm 1. This framework breaks through the strong dependence of classical theories on global data exchangeability, providing universal theoretical support for small -batch scenarios such as time -series data and online learning. E -value  [31, 32] , as a non -negative random variable satisfying E[E] ≤ 1, can directly construct conformal sets through probability inequalities, offering a more flexible uncertainty quantification tool. For the calibration set\n\ni=1 and the test sample (X n+1 , Y n+1 ), the E -value is defined as:\n\nwhere s i = s(X i , Y i ) and s is a non -conformity score (such as cross -entropy loss) with non -negative values. Under the assumption of within -batch data exchangeability, the conditional expectation of the E -value satisfies E[E t |F t-1 ] = 1, which provides a crucial basis for constructing the martingale process.\n\nThe filtration {F t } t≥0 is defined as the σ -algebra generated by all historical data up to the t batch. Specifically, we define the filtration\n\nFor all t ≥ 0, the sequence of random variables {M t } t≥0 is defined as:\n\nwhere\n\nWe will prove that {M t } t≥0 is a non -negative test supermartingale.\n\n• Initial condition: First, we define M 0 = 1. Since the non -conformity scores we calculate are positive, it is obvious that for all t ≥ 0, M t ≥ 0. The remaining task is to prove that {M t } t≥0 is a supermartingale. A nonnegative test supermartingale needs to satisfy: M 0 = 1 (already satisfied), M t ≥ 0 and is F t -measurable, and\n\n• Measurability: To determine whether M t is measurable after defining the filtration, we use mathematical induction. When t = 0, M 0 = 1. Since a constant function is measurable with respect to any σ -algebra, M 0 is F 0 -measurable, where\n\n, where I At is the indicator function of the set A t . The indicator functions I At and I A c t are both F t -measurable, and the products of the constant 1 and the measurable function Z t with the indicator functions are also F t -measurable. Thus, their sum M t is F tmeasurable. In conclusion, by mathematical induction, we have proved that for the defined filtration {F t } t≥0 , M t is F t -measurable.\n\n• Decreasing conditional expectation: Under the assumption of within -batch data exchangeability,\n\nwhich satisfies the property of a supermartingale.\n\nVille's inequality states that for a non -negative supermartingale M t , P (∀t ≥ 0, M t < 1 α ) ≥ 1 -α. The construction rule of the prediction set is to include the corresponding category in the prediction set when M t < 1 α . This means that the probability that the true label falls into the prediction set is at least 1 -α, thus theoretically guaranteeing the coverage rate of the prediction set. Let x t be the t -th test sample and Y be the set of all possible categories. For the test sample x t , its prediction set Ĉ(x t ) can be expressed as: The IEMOCAP dataset contains 12 hours of audio-visual data collected across 5 recording sessions, where ten professional actors (5 male, 5 female) simulate real-life interaction scenarios.  [33] For model training, six emotion categories are selected: \"ang\" (anger), \"hap\" (happiness), \"exc\" (excitement), \"sad\" (sadness), \"fru\" (frustration), and \"neu\" (neutral). A stratified sampling approach is employed to ensure each category provides 2,000 balanced training samples. The TESS dataset comprises 2,800 audio files, in which two female actors express seven discrete emotions through the fixed carrier sentence structure \"Say the word_\".  [34] To establish cross-dataset consistency, only emotion categories overlapping with IEMOCAP are retained. Specifically, \"Anger\", \"Happiness\", \"Sadness\", and \"Neutral\" in TESS are mapped to the corresponding IEMOCAP labels \"ang\", \"hap\", \"sad\", and \"neu\", respectively. This label harmonization ensures uniform emotional category definitions during model training and evaluation across datasets.",

In the experimental  design, we adopt a dynamic calibration mechanism: the confidence threshold q is calculated through the calibration set data, and its statistical validity is verified under different calibration set -test set partition ratios (10%-90%). The experimental results show that although the calibration set size changes significantly (from 10% to 90%), this method always ensures the empirical coverage of the test set satisfies the theoretical lower bound 1 -α (α = 0.2), as shown in the figure  7  by dynamically adjusting the confidence threshold q. Theoretical analysis and empirical results jointly prove that this method exhibits strong robustness to data partition ratios.  In order to verify the effectiveness of the proposed martingale method and the rationality of the assumption of local interchangeability in small batch scenarios, this paper adopts a cross-dataset experimental design, focusing on the actual scenario where inter-batch data does not meet global interchangeability. The calibration set is selected from the IEMOCAP speech emotion dataset, and the test set is the TESS dataset. There are significant differences in the speaker, emotional expression mode and acoustic environment which directly leads to inconsistent data distribution between batches (that is, the inter-batch does not meet the interchangeability). The experiment divides the data into \"local batches\", each batch contains 5 calibration data and 1 test data, strengthening the local correlation of internal data by limiting the batch size -although there may be significant distribution differences between batches (such as grouping characteristics of different time periods and different scenarios), the data within a single batch can approximately meet \"local interchangeability\" because it comes from a closer local distribution. As shown in the figure  8 , traditional methods experience significant coverage bias when data does not satisfy exchangeability, as the global exchangeability assumption fails, resulting in empirical coverage below the target value. This method uses the local exchangeability assumption and martingale value screening, and when the distribution difference between batches is significant, the empirical coverage rate and target value are still achieved, verifying the validity of the relaxation assumption that \"interchangeability can not be met between batches\".M t significantly affects the quality of the conformal set at batch t. As the martingale approaches zero, the conformal set becomes larger and less informative. The figure  9  shows the changing path of M t . It is worth noting that this method ensures coverage but does not control the size of the conformal set; stronger models generally produce smaller sets.  This framework does not require global data to obey the same distribution, significantly relaxing the prerequisites for traditional conformal prediction, and is suitable for complex scenarios where there is a distribution offset between batches.",

The results show that traditional point prediction methods have significant confidence bias due to factors such as data distribution differences, model overfitting, and difficulty in capturing complex emotional features. By using the SCP framework and RCCP framework, this study successfully transforms single-point predictions into set predictions with coverage guarantees, ensuring that the true label is included in the prediction set with a probability of at least 1 -α under a specified risk level α. In addition, cross-dataset validation proves the robustness of the framework under different data distributions. The study also finds that APSS is negatively correlated with the risk level, indicating that when the risk level is high, the model's prediction set is usually smaller and the model's prediction uncertainty is lower. Based on this finding, we propose a metric for evaluating the uncertainty of classification models on the test set. At the same time, our mini-batch martingale value conformal prediction theory extends the applicability of CP to non-exchangeable environments, solving a key flaw in existing uncertainty quantification methods. By adopting the local exchangeability assumption within the mini-batch and constructing a non-negative test martingale, our method maintains coverage guarantees even under non-exchangeable data.",
