      "text": "Despite notable progress, speech emotion recognition (SER) remains challenging due to the intricate and ambiguous nature of speech emotion, particularly in wild world. While current studies primarily focus on recognition and generalization abilities, our research pioneers an investigation into the reliability of SER methods in the presence of semantic data shifts and explores how to exert fine-grained control over various attributes inherent in speech signals to enhance speech emotion modeling. In this paper, we first introduce MSAC-SERNet, a novel unified SER framework capable of simultaneously handling both single-corpus and cross-corpus SER. Specifically, concentrating exclusively on the speech emotion attribute, a novel CNN-based SER model is presented to extract discriminative emotional representations, guided by additive margin softmax loss. Considering information overlap between various speech attributes, we propose a novel learning paradigm based on correlations of different speech attributes, termed Multiple Speech Attribute Control (MSAC), which empowers the proposed SER model to simultaneously capture fine-grained emotion-related features while mitigating the negative impact of emotion-agnostic representations. Furthermore, we make a first attempt to examine the reliability of the MSAC-SERNet framework using out-ofdistribution detection methods. Experiments on both singlecorpus and cross-corpus SER scenarios indicate that MSAC-SERNet not only consistently outperforms the baseline in all aspects, but achieves superior performance compared to stateof-the-art SER approaches.",

      "text": "H UMAN emotion, intricately woven from the threads of personal connections, environmental stimuli, and cognitive processes, stands as a captivating and complex facet of the human experience  [1] . As a powerful catalyst, emotions not only steer human behavior but also weave their essence into the fabric of daily interactions and professional endeavors  [2] . It is within this nuanced context that the fusion of emotion and technology takes center stage, giving rise to the significant field of speech emotion recognition (SER), of which primary goal is to automatically discern emotional states within spoken communication. Given the potential to profoundly impact both human well-being and technological advancements, SER plays a crucial role in diverse practical applications, such as human machine interaction  [3] , healthcare  [4] , education  [5] , business  [6] , and so forth. In the realm of SER, diverse speech signals from speakers of different regions and recording environments usually exhibit distinct characteristics, yet there exists implicit similar emotional information within the same emotion category, as pointed out in  [7] . Consequently, the fundamental challenge in SER lies in acknowledging the inherent variability within signals while identifying the intrinsic emotional representations in these information sources, aiming to construct robust models for prediction.\n\nUnder such scenarios, how to train an effective and robust classifier for SER based on these signals has been a subject of research for over two decades. Early studies usually focus on single-corpus tasks, where models were developed and evaluated within the confines of a singular emotion corpus. These approaches emphasize improving the discrimination of handcrafted features  [8] -  [10] , which are then input into conventional machine learning algorithms like support vector machine (SVM)  [11] ,  [12] , decision trees  [12] ,  [13] , or Bayesian classifiers  [14] . In recent years, with the remarkable development of machine learning and deep learning technology, deep neural network (DNN) based methods, such as Long Short-term Memory (LSTM)  [15] -  [17] , Recurrent Neural Network (RNN)  [18] ,  [19] , Convolution Neural Network (CNN)  [20] -  [22] , and others  [23] -  [27] , have become the mainstream approach in SER. Benefiting from the robust feature learning capability of DNNs, the performance of these methods has undergone a significant enhancement compared to traditional approaches. Afterwards, researchers progressively shifted their attention towards cross-corpus SER tasks, which involve training SER models using one or more public datasets and then evaluating their recognition capabilities and generalization performance with unseen emotional corpora. These methods often prioritize paradigmatic design, typically integrating the comprehensive utilization of diverse speech attributes within the signal. For instance, Xiao et al  [28]  presented a generalized domain adversarial neural network (GDANN) and a class-aligned GDANN to learn domain-invariant representations for robust emotion recognition. Latif et al  [22]  introduced an adversarial dual discriminator (ADDi) network and a self-supervised learning based ADDi network to address the performance degradation of the cross-corpus and cross-language SER. Yu et al  [25]  advocated a gender-attribute-augmented contrastive languageaudio pretraining SER framework with the guidance of natural language supervisions to identify emotions.\n\nNevertheless, notwithstanding impressive advancements, these approaches still have several limitations, and the SER task remains open and challenging.\n\n• First, there is limited research attention directed towards simultaneously addressing single-corpus and cross-corpus SER tasks  [29] , whereas the demand for such capabilities is imperative in complex real-world applications. • Second, despite numerous recent studies  [22] ,  [25] ,  [28] ,  [30] -  [34]  aiming to enhance the SER performance through the incorporation of various additional speech attributes (gender, speaker, language, etc) via adaptive or adversarial domain adaptation methods, correlations among different speech attributes are often overlooked.\n\nFor instance, the commonly used voiceprint/speaker attribute based gradient reversal control method, while partially mitigating the speaker bias issue in SER  [12] ,  [35] ,  [36] , also impairs gender attribute information in the speech signal. However, according to many literature  [25] ,  [33] ,  [34] , gender attributes undoubtedly provide useful information for speech emotion classification. • Third, in comparison to other domains like computer vision (CV)  [37] -  [39] , natural language processing (NLP)  [40] -  [42] , or even tasks within speech processing such as automatic speech recognition  [43] -  [45] , it is noteworthy that there is a scarcity of publicly available benchmarks for SER, with the majority being of a relatively modest scale. In this context, the trained SER methods will inevitably encounter unseen or unfamiliar data when deployed in the open world, thus placing high demands on the reliability of the SER methods. However, current SER field largely focuses on the approaches' recognition and generalization performance, while ignoring the reliability performance which is of great importance in real-world applications, such as medical diagnosis, legal assistance, security monitoring, and so on.\n\nHence in this study, we pioneer an investigation into the reliability of SER methods in the presence of semantic data shifts, and introduce a novel unified SER workflow termed MSAC-SERNet that is able to simultaneously address both single-corpus and cross-corpus SER tasks. Our primary focus is on intricately modeling speech emotion by exercising precise control over diverse speech attributes. In summary, the main contributions of this paper are four-fold. all facets within the speaker-independent mode. The rest of this work is arranged as the following. In Section II, we provide the overview of related work. Section III describes the details of the proposed MSAC-SERNet which mainly consists of three parts, as depicted in Fig 1 . In Section IV, we introduce the corresponding experimental settings, results, and analysis of the single-corpus and cross-corpus SER tasks. Section VI draws the conclusions.",

Speaker-dependent and Speaker-independent SER Current SER field can be categorized into speakerdependent SER  [16] ,  [51] ,  [52]  and speaker-independent SER  [18] ,  [25] ,  [35] ,  [53]  on the basis of whether the same speaker is utilized during both the training and testing phases.\n\nIn general, the former relies on training and testing data from the same or partially overlapping set of speakers, emphasizing the recognition of individualized emotional nuances. In  [51] , features extracted using a hybrid of pitch, formants, MFCC, and their statistical parameters were input into an SVM classifier. In  [16] , a 1D CNN LSTM network and a 2D CNN LSTM network were designed to capture local and global features for SER. Despite achieving great recognition results, when it comes to the speaker-independent SER task that is more analogous to real-world scenarios, their performance tends to exhibit significant degradation. The primary reason for this lies in the fact that individuals exhibit varying rhythms, tones, and styles when speaking. Even when expressing the same emotion, such as happiness in their utterances, the differences can be substantial. However, speaker-dependent As a consequence, an increasing number of recent works have shifted their focus towards the speaker-independent SER task. In contrast, the speaker-independent SER task poses a more intricate challenge, as it not only requires accurate differentiation of diverse speech emotions but also demands the resolution or alleviation of feature distribution variations introduced by different speakers during training and testing phases. To solve this problem, numerous studies have been advocated. For example,  [18]  proposed an attention-based convolutional recurrent neural network to extract discriminative reprsentations for emotion recognition using Mel-spectrogram with deltas and delta-deltas. In  [35] , the authors presented a speaker normalization method based on the pre-trained HuBERT features for SER.",

Holistically, existing ADA approaches aim to enhance the performance of the SER methods by controlling various speech attributes of the speech signal via techniques such as multi-task learning, adversarial learning, and so on. For instance, Xiao et al  [28]  presented a generalized domain adversarial neural network (GDANN) and a class-aligned GDANN to learn the domain-invariant feature representations for robust emotion recognition. Latif et al  [22]  introduced an adversarial dual discriminator (ADDi) network and a selfsupervised learning based ADDi network to address the performance degradation of the cross-corpus and cross-language SER. Ahn et al  [32]  proposed a few-shot learning and unsupervised domain adaptation based SER model, aiming to acquire emotion similarity by leveraging source samples adapted to the target domain.\n\nNonetheless, despite improved performance, they usually neglect the interconnections among various speech attributes. In contrast, our study endeavors to augment speech emotion modeling through a holistic consideration of the interrelationships among diverse speech attributes.",

To be specific, all speech signals undergo normalization within the range of -1 to 1. Subsequently, we apply the framing operation and a Hamming window to segment each speech signal into frames with a length of 25ms and a shift of 10ms. Finally, we obtain the FBanks for each frame through a 1024-point fast Fourier transform and a mel-scale filter bank analysis.",

Following this convolutional operation, one batch normalization (BN) and one rectified linear unit (ReLU) activation layers are applied. The resulting features undergo the concatenation operation and an additional convolution layer with a 5×5 kernel, followed by a downsampling operation through an average pooling layer.\n\nSubsequently, in order to further augment the representational capacity and discriminability of shallow features, we additionally constructed a deep feature extraction module which consists of multiple convolution blocks.

      "text": "Existing studies  [68] -  [70]  have demonstrated the intricate challenge of decoupling speech signals, highlighting the inevitable overlap among different speech attributes. In this context, numerous researchers  [22] ,  [30] ,  [35]  have endeavored to enhance SER performance through the incorporation of attribute-based ADA methods. Nevertheless, we contend that their performance still falls short of optimal, as they predominantly utilize diverse speech attributes without adequately considering their interrelationships. To solve this issue, a novel and effective MSAC method that explicitly models and controls different speech attributes is proposed, as shown in Fig.  3 .\n\nUnlike previous works, our proposed MSAC models speech emotion attribute based on correlations across additional speech attributes, aiming to simultaneously capture finegrained emotion-related representations while mitigating the negative impact of emotion-agnostic features. More precisely, our proposed MSAC method first classifies different speech attributes into emotion, emotion-agnostic and emotioncorrelated attributes. The speaker and language speech attributes are regarded as emotion-agnostic speech attributes, because they share fewer acoustic properties with the emotion attribute. In contrast, the gender attribute is an emotioncorrelated speech attribute, as male and female speech signals usually exhibit substantial differences in energy, pitch, and other acoustic characteristics which are of great importance for SER. Then, for emotions and emotion-associated attributes, we employ a multi-task learning strategy to preserve valuable information for emotion identification, guided by the AM-Softmax loss. Meanwhile, regarding emotion-agnostic speech attributes, we not only utilize the multi-task learning strategy but also employ gradient reversal  [30]  which transmits data during forward propagation and reverses the sign of the gradient during backward propagation, thereby mitigating their influence on the emotion attribute. Moreover, it is essential to point out that all of these speech attributes should be optimized together since they are mutually influenced.\n\nTherefore, the final classification loss can be formulated as follows:\n\nwhere L Eag , L Eco , and L E are AM-Softmax classification loss of emotion-agnostic, emotion-correlated, and emotion attributes, a i and α i are emotion-agnostic attribute and its weight coefficient, a j and α j are emotion-correlated attribute and its weight coefficient, N and M represent the number of used emotion-agnostic and emotion-correlated attributes.\n\nRegarding the values for these hyper-parameters, please refer to the experiment section.

The rationale behind this trend stems from the reasonable and stringent constraints imposed by learning paradigms, allowing the model to incorporate more useful information from diverse speech attributes. This approach, to some extent, facilitates the effective acquisition of speech emotion information, leading to an overall enhancement in the model's performance. Besides, as evident from the tables above, the results clearly demonstrate the superior performance of our proposed MSAC over existing learning paradigm such as  [86] . This superiority is attributed to the fact that our MSAC is modeled based on the relationships among diverse speech attributes, representing a more rational approach that enables the capture of finer-grained emotional feature representation.\n\nTo scrutinize the recognition performance of each category, we further present the confusion matrices for MSAC-SERNet and its variants on IEMOCAP in Fig.  4 , where ANG, SAD, HAP, NEU represent angry, sad, happy, and neutral. It illustrates that our proposed MSAC-SERNet gains a comparable or higher recognition accuracy for each emotion than its variants, which validates the effectiveness of the proposed SER model architecture and MSAC learning paradigm.\n\n2) Cross-corpus SER Task: Moreover, We also test the recognition and generalization performance of our proposed MSAC-SERNet and its variants in the cross-corpus SER task. As illustrated in Table  VII , it can be ascertained that the proposed MSAC-SERNet also consistently achieves the best performance in terms of ID recognition and OOD generalization performance, which further validates the effectiveness of the proposed unified SER workflow.\n\nConcretely, in terms of the ID recognition and OOD generalization performance, our proposed SER model achieves a ID WAR of 44.64%, a ID UAR of 44.42%, and a OOD WAR/UAR of 54.25%, respectively. Then, when applying the commonly used ADA method which could enable the model to be less affected by the emotion-agnostic speaker attribute, the WAR and UAR of the model's ID recogni-tion performance are improved by 4.58% and 2.56%, the WAR/UAR of the model's OOD generalization performance is improved by 3.3%. Afterward, when adding G ML stragegy on top of SGR, the model is able to reduce the negative impact of the speaker attribute while retaining the useful emotion-correlated gender attribute information for SER. As a result, the WAR and UAR of ID recognition performance are further enhanced by 2.02% and 5.89%, the WAR/UAR of OOD generalization performance is further improved by 0.8% as well. In particular, when using our proposed MSAC method which simultaneously controls all known emotion-agnostic and emotion-correlated speech attributes, the proposed SER model achieves the best ID recognition and OOD generalization performance which outperforms the baseline by 8.61%, 9.29% and 7.35%, respectively.",

      "text": "In recent years, as AI models continue to showcase substantial potential across diverse practical domains, their reliability has garnered significant attention. In this context, we initiate a preliminary analysis of the reliability of SER models when facing semantic data shifts. To be specific, we use four SOTA OOD detection methods and propose one simple OOD detection method rODIN which is a variant of ODIN, so as to verify the reliability performance of our MSAC-SERNet.\n\n1) Single-corpus SER Task: First, we compare the reliability of the proposed MSAC-SERNet and its variants in the single-corpus SER task, whose corresponding results are delineated in Table  VIII .\n\nAccording to the reported results, it is apparent that as additional speech attributes are gradually controlled, the reliability performance of the proposed base model continuously improves, with the exception of the Base + G ML for the ReACT method. In general, the S GR performs better than the G ML learning paradigm, and our proposed MSAC achieves the best results. Take the commonly used MaxLogit OOD method as an example. Our proposed base model attains FPR95 of 95.74% and AUROC of 59.95% which hardly identifies any OOD samples. When exerting control over additional speech attributes, namely speaker and gender, their reliability performance has been gradually enhanced. In particular, when utilizing our proposed MSAC learning paradigm, the proposed  method realizes a remarkable 27.40% FPR95 reduction and a significant AUROC upgrade of 13.22% as opposed to the baseline, reaching a preliminary usable level for OOD detection. And it also indicates that by incorporating emotionassociated speech attributes and attenuating emotion-agnostic speech information, the proposed MSAC-SERNet can extract more robust emotional features, thereby enhancing the model's OOD detection capabilities when facing semantic shifts. Additionally, we observe an intriguing phenomenon where commonly used techniques in CV and NLP for enhancing OOD detection performance do not necessarily apply to the SER task. Concretely, the ODIN method, which introduces a positive perturbation to the input signal to some extent enlarging the confidence distribution of ID and OOD samples, exhibits undesirable effects in SER. Contrarily, our experiments show that our proposed rODIN method which introduces a reverse perturbation to the input signal, akin to generating adversarial examples  [87] , can slightly enhance the model's OOD detection capabilities in the domain of SER.\n\nFurthermore, to conduct an in-depth analysis of reliability performance, we employ the unsupervised t-SNE technique to visualize the features' distribution of ID and OOD data from the IEMOCAP corpus. In particular, we perform a comparative analysis using our proposed SER base model, MSAC-SERNet and its variants, as depicted in Fig.  5 . From the figure, it is evident that our proposed MSAC-SERNet exhibits a more pronounced disparity in the distribution of ID and OOD data compared to its baseline model and variants. This is attributed to the finer control over various speech attributes incorporated into the MSAC-SERNet, enabling the model to capture more nuanced emotional feature representations. Consequently, this enhancement contributes to improved reliability performance when facing semantic data shifts.\n\n2) Cross-corpus SER Task: Subsequently, the reliability comparison of the proposed MSAC-SERNet and its variants in the cross-corpus SER task is performed, and the results are illustrated in Table  IX . Similarly, it can be easily perceived that, for all employed OOD detection methods, our proposed MSAC approach enables the proposed base SER model to achieve the highest reliability performance. Besides, compared with the existing four OOD detection methods, the proposed rODIN method attains the best reliability performance as well. Furthermore, we find that when using additional speech attribute based gradient reversal strategy to optimize the proposed base model, the reliability performance generally outperforms that of the multitask learning strategy-based approaches. Consider the rODIN method, for instance. Our proposed base SER model acquires the FPR95 and AUROC of 95.34% and 59.10%. When adding one additional speech attribute control, it can be viewed that the Base + G ML performs even worse than the baseline, while the Base + S GR and Base + L GR achieve marginal enhancement over the baseline. When exerting control over two additional speech attributes, the Base + L GR + S GR outperforms Base + G ML + L GR and Base + G ML + S GR , yet, they all exhibit varying degrees of decline in AUROC performance. Comparatively, when incorporating the proposed MSAC, our proposed SER model obtains a 5.98% reduction in FPR95 and a 4.02% improvement in AUROC compared with the baseline.",

      "text": "In this paper, we introduce a novel unified SER workflow, MSAC-SERNet, based on the data distribution of various speech attributes for both single-corpus and cross-corpus SER. In addition, we pioneer an exploration into the reliability performance of the proposed MSAC-SERNet framework and propose a new OOD detection method for the SER tasks. Comprehensive experiments conducted on six public emotion corpora demonstrate that our proposed MSAC-SERNet not only achieves superior recognition and generalization results compared to state-of-the-art (SOTA) single-corpus and crosscorpus SER approaches but also consistently outperforms the baseline SER model in all aspects, including recognition, generalization, and reliability. Our findings highlight that intricately modeling speech emotion by exerting additional precise control over diverse speech attributes consistently enhances the overall performance of the proposed SER workflow. Furthermore, we observe that commonly employed OOD detection techniques in CV and NLP fields, such as the input positive perturbation of the ODIN method, may not necessarily be applicable to the SER task. This implies the necessity for developing an OOD detection method more tailored to the inherent nature of SER tasks.\n\nIn future work, we will explore exerting control over a broader range of additional speech attributes and leverage the characteristics of SER tasks to propose more efficient OOD detection methods.",
