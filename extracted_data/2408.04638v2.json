      "text": "Affective Computing (AC) integrates computer science, psychology, and cognitive science to enable machines to recognize, interpret, and simulate human emotions across domains such as social media, finance, healthcare, and education. AC commonly centers on two task families: Affective Understanding (AU) and Affective Generation (AG). While fine-tuned pre-trained language models (PLMs) have achieved solid AU performance, they often generalize poorly across tasks and remain limited for AG, especially in producing diverse, emotionally appropriate responses. The advent of Large Language Models (LLMs) (e.g., ChatGPT and LLaMA) has catalyzed a paradigm shift by offering in-context learning, broader world knowledge, and stronger sequence generation. This survey presents an NLPoriented overview of AC in the LLM era. We (i) consolidate traditional AC tasks and preliminary LLM-based studies; (ii) review adaptation techniques that improve AU/AG, including Instruction Tuning (full and parameter-efficient methods such as LoRA, P-/Prompt-Tuning), Prompt Engineering (zero/few-shot, chain-of-thought, agent-based prompting), and Reinforcement Learning. For the latter, we summarize RL from human preferences (RLHF), verifiable/programmatic rewards (RLVR), and AI feedback (RLAIF), which provide preference-or rule-grounded optimization signals that can help steer AU/AG toward empathy, safety, and planning, achieving finer-grained or multi-objective control. To assess progress, we compile benchmarks and evaluation practices for both AU and AG. We also discuss open challenges-from ethics, data quality, and safety to robust evaluation and resource efficiency-and outline research directions. We hope this survey clarifies the landscape and offers practical guidance for building affect-aware, reliable, and responsible LLM systems.",

      "text": "Affective Computing (AC), encompassing the study and development of systems capable of recognizing, interpreting, processing, and simulating human affects through natural language and other modalities, seeks to bridge the gap between human emotions and machine understanding  Picard (2000) ;  Tao & Tan (2005) ;  Banafa (2024) . The AC task can be broadly categorized into two mainstream tasks: the Affective Understanding (AU) task  Zhao et al. (2023a)  and the Affective Generation (AG) task  Nie & Zhan (2022) ;  Pei et al. (2024) . Affective Understanding focuses on recognizing and interpreting human emotions, covering Sentiment Analysis  Medhat et al. (2014) ;  Taboada (2016) , Sarcasm Detection  Joshi et al. (2017) ;  Verma et al. (2021) , and so on. Affective Generation involves creating responses or content that can elicit specific emotional responses in humans to generate expressions with emotionally nuanced, including Emotional-aware Dialogue Generation  Rashkin et al. (2019) ;  Liu et al. (2021) , Creative Content Generation, etc. With the emergence of Large Language Models (LLMs) OpenAI (2023);  Touvron et al. (2023) ;  Zeng et al. (2023) , the Affective Computing task is experiencing a paradigm shift to explore and model human emotions in unprecedented ways.\n\nPrior to the advent of LLMs, the dominant paradigm of Affective Computing involves fine-tuning Pre-trained Language Models (PLMs)  Amin et al. (2023a) , such as  BERT Devlin et al. (2019)  and RoBERTa  Liu et al. (2019) , on labelled datasets for specific tasks to improve performance. While the above training paradigm has achieved numerous successes in the tasks related to Affective Understanding, it still is inherently limited by the quality and scale of manually annotated data and struggles to generalize to new domains  Mao et al. (2023) . The rise of LLMs research, as demonstrated in Figure  1 , profoundly transforms the research paradigm of AC, expanding task variety and surpassing the constraints of previous studies, which often focus on particular datasets and single-task the performance improvements  Tan et al. (2023a) ;  Krugmann & Hartmann (2024) . This evolution is accompanied by developing novel approaches that exploit the vast knowledge of LLMs  Wei et al. (2022a)  to simultaneously boost the performance of various tasks related to Affective Computing.\n\nThe auto-regressive nature and massive pre-training of LLMs give them an advantage in processing dialogue inputs and generating coherent responses  Radford et al. (2018) ;  Brown et al. (2020) . Various techniques are proposed to fully harness and enhance the capabilities of LLMs, including Instruction Tuning, Prompt Engineering and Reinforcement Learning. Specifically, Instruction Tuning Chung   2009 ) (e.g.,  MLP Rosenblatt (1958) ,  LSTM Hochreiter & Schmidhuber (1997) ), typically requiring a separate model per task. In the LLMs era, a single (mostly frozen) LLM handles multiple tasks via (i) instruction tuning with adapters, (ii) prompt engineering, and (iii) reinforcement learning that samples rollouts and uses reward/preference signals to optimize a loss and update the adapters.\n\net al. (  2024 );  Zhang et al. (2024d)  involves fine-tuning a pre-trained language model on the dataset where tasks are explicitly defined through instructions. For example, Flan-T5  Chung et al. (2024)  designs specific instructions for different tasks, e.g., Sentiment Analysis, Commonsense Reasoning, Question Answering, etc. Instruction Tuning is a form of targeted training that aims to make the model more adept at following complex and varied instructions across different domains. Prompt Engineering  Zhou et al. (2023b) ;  White et al. (2023)  is more about crafting the input given to the model to elicit the desired output without modifying the model itself. In-context Learning can further mine a model to learn and apply knowledge based on the instances provided directly within the prompt, without any prior explicit training on these specific tasks  Xie et al. (2022) . Reinforcement Learning optimizes the model against preference-based or verifiable rewards to improve helpfulness, safety, and style. A common pipeline, Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF), first trains a reward model from human comparisons and then updates the policy with online RL-typically Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO)  Lambert (2025) . Complementary directions include Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR)  Lambert et al. (2024) , which uses rule-checkers or pass/fail signals as rewards, and methods that reduce or avoid online RL, such as Direct Preference Optimization (DPO)  Rafailov et al. (2023a) . Reinforcement Learning from AI Feedback (RLAIF) distills feedback from capable AI evaluators or rule sets into the preference signal (e.g.,  Wen et al. (2025) ). For AC tasks, these approaches allow alignment directly toward affectaware objectives, covering politeness, empathy, and non-toxic style.\n\nAlthough LLMs offer new opportunities and show initial success in various tasks, a comprehensive review that consolidates and summarizes the recent advancements in AC with LLMs from an NLP perspective still needs to be present. Existing surveys either focus narrowly on specific tasks like sentiment analysis or a limited set of classic affective computing tasks  Tan et al. (2023a) ;  Wake et al. (2023) ;  Cui et al. (2023) ;  Zhang et al. (2023e) ;  Zhu et al. (2024) , or they concentrate on traditional, non-LLM-based methods  Amin et al. (2023a) ;  Afzal et al. (2023) . To mitigate the gap, it is essential to provide a comprehensive overview (Figure  2 ) of how LLMs are being applied across the diverse spectrum of tasks related to AC, along with the unique opportunities and challenges they bring. Accordingly, we investigate the capabilities and limitations of LLMs in AC tasks, covering both Affective Understanding and Generation. While our focus is primarily on NLP, we also include textcentric multimodal affective computing tasks, recognizing the growing importance of integrating multiple modalities in AC. We begin by summarizing early studies that laid the groundwork for understanding the capabilities and limitations of LLMs in AC. Building on this, we explore three critical technologies for adapting LLMs to AC tasks: instruction tuning ( §4), prompt engineering ( §5) and reinforcement learning ( §6). While tuning grounds the model in task formats and prompting controls behavior at inference, RL supplies preference-or programmatically verifiable objectives that close the optimization loop. To deliver a comprehensive assessment, we further summarize benchmarks and evaluation methods ( §7) for systematically evaluating LLMs' performance in AC, including the innovative use of LLMs as evaluation tools. Finally, we enumerate open challenges and Table  1  The traditional tasks of Affective Computing from an NLP perspective, with representative methods in the LLM era.",

      "text": "Sentiment Analysis (SA), a classic task in the Affective Computing domain, focus on the automatic identification and categorization of emotions and sentiments expressed through contents from users  Tan et al. (2023b) ;  Rodríguez-Ibánez et al. (2023) ;  Das & Singh (2023) .\n\nTo evaluate the performance of LLMs in SA tasks, researchers conduct assessments on multiple datasets and discover that the performance of LLMs is closely related to the complexity of the SA tasks they face. For more straightforward sentiment analysis tasks, such as Polarity Classification (PC), closed-source large language models like GPT-3.5-turbo demonstrate robust zero-shot learning capabilities and can deliver satisfactory results  Krugmann & Hartmann (2024) ;  Zhang et al. (2023f); Belal et al. (2023) ;  Lossio-Ventura et al. (2024) ;  Alexandersen & Rutlin (2024) . However, when confronted with complex SA tasks requiring deep semantic understanding or structured emotional information, such as Emotional Classification (EC), Aspected-Based Sentiment Analysis (ABSA), Emotional Recognition in Conversation (ERC), etc., which involves identifying multiple sentiments corresponding to different aspects of a post, or Emotion Cause Analysis, the performance of LLMs still lags behind that of pre-trained language models (PLMs) fine-tuned on specific datasets  Zhang et al. (2023f) ;  Amin et al. (2024) ;  Wang et al. (2024h) ;  Wu et al. (2024a) . This discrepancy may stem from LLMs lacking training data tailored to specific tasks and having insufficient capabilities to process complex semantic information.\n\nAlthough the zero-shot learning capabilities of opensource LLMs are inferior to those of closed-source models, their superior few-shot learning abilities give them an advantage on datasets with limited training data or imbalanced distributions, outperforming PLMs in such scenarios. However, when data is abundant and label distribution is balanced, PLMs can still perform better due to their finetuning advantage on specific datasets  Zhang et al. (2023d) . Notably, LLMs show superior generalization capabilities in SA tasks compared to PLMs. By simply altering the prompts, LLMs can adapt to different datasets and tasks without requiring model retraining  Wang et al. (2024h) . However, the performance of LLMs is also affected by prompts and decoding parameters. For example, minor text attacks like synonym substitution can lead to fluctuations in their performance. Additionally, because of the auto-regressive decoding mechanism, parameters such as temperature and Top-P can significantly impact the effectiveness of LLMs in sentiment analysis tasks. Typically, a lower temperature value (below 0.3) and a lower Top-P value are necessary for achieving better results  Amin et al. (2023a) ;  Amin & Schuller (2024) . This suggests that although research shows carefully crafted prompts can greatly improve LLMs'performance, developing optimal prompts and setting effective hyper-parameters for specific tasks and contexts remains an unresolved research challenge.",

      "text": "LLMs demonstrate considerable performance variations across various Subjective Text Analysis (STA) related tasks. For instance, they excel in tasks involving negative emotion recognition, such as well-being assessment and toxicity detection. The superior performance could be due to the focus on safety and value alignment during the Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) stage of LLM training  Zheng et al. (2023a) ;  Amin et al. (2023a Amin et al. ( , 2024)) . However, in tasks requiring the understanding of implicit emotional cues, such as engagement measurement, personality assessment, and sarcasm detection, LLMs exhibit a performance gap compared to PLMs fine-tuned on task-specific datasets. This discrepancy may stem from a need for more specialized training data during the supervised fine-tuning (SFT) phase of LLM development. Optimizing prompts for LLMs can enhance their performance on these specific tasks  Amin et al. (2023a Amin et al. ( , 2024)) . Furthermore, leveraging their robust capacity for capturing contextual information, LLMs consistently demonstrate superior performance in processing longer texts compared to shorter texts across various subjective text analysis tasks  Amin et al. (2024) ;  Krugmann & Hartmann (2024) . LLMs perform slightly worse than SFT models tailored to specific tasks in complex sentiment computing areas like sarcasm detection and subtle sentiment analysis. However, the substantial computational and time resources needed to fine-tune these large language models present a significant hurdle. Consequently, developing LLMs with outperformance and minimal training for specific tasks is an important research priority.",

Human evaluations indicate that GPT-4's responses exceed human performance by an average of 10% in empathy levels  Welivita & Pu (2024) . Unlike earlier models, LLMs produce longer and more diverse text  Welivita & Pu (2024) , introducing new evaluation challenges. Traditional automatic evaluation methods based on overlap metrics need to adequately measure the performance of LLMs in emotional generation tasks, while manual evaluation is costly and burdensome to scale.

(2003) ;  Neubauer & Freudenthaler (2005)  is the ability to recognize, understand, manage, and use emotions effectively in various contexts. EI is crucial for enhancing the naturalness and effectiveness of human-computer interaction and is a vital component in achieving Artificial General Intelligence (AGI). To explore whether LLMs possess EI, researchers undertake investigations from various perspectives. Current studies  Elyoseph et al. (2024) ;  Ratican & Hutson (2023)  draw upon assessment methods from the field of human psychology, employing tools, like the Levels of Emotional Awareness Scale (LEAS)  Lane et al. (1990) , to evaluate the ability of LLMs to perceive emotions. LLMs can generate relatively appropriate emotional responses, which has been evidenced.\n\nHowever, using human-centric evaluation systems to measure the EI of LLMs has limitations, including the fact that the scales are designed with humans in mind, not explicitly specifically for LLMs and that the evaluations rely on human experts to conduct the assessments. Researchers have developed evaluation tools designed explicitly for LLMs to address these issue, such as the Situational Evaluation of Complex Emotional Understanding (SECEU)  Wang et al. (2023e) . Moreover, to improve the objectivity and efficiency of evaluations, EQ-bench has been proposed  Paech (2024) . It removes the need for expert assessments and instead directly evaluates the ability of LLMs to understand complex emotions and social interactions by predicting the intensity of emotional states in dialogue characters. While LLMs have demonstrated remarkable performance on SECEU and EQBench, which focus more on the cognition and understanding of human emotional scenarios, there is still insufficient evidence to suggest that they possess emotional intelligence comparable to humans. To address this gap, researchers propose a new task called Sentiment and Opinion Understanding of Language (SOUL), which aims to comprehensively evaluate the model's ability to understand complex emotions through two sub-tasks, including Review Comprehension and Justification Generation. However, experimental results reveal a substantial performance gap of up to 27% between LLMs and human performance on the SOUL  Deng et al. (2023d) .

Due to the substantial size of LLMs, which often exceed ten billion parameters, Full Parameter Fine-Tuning (FPFT) of all parameters of the complete model could be more practical.\n\nTo reduce the cost of model training, a series of Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) approaches are proposed, such as LoRA  Devalal & Karthikeyan (2018) , Prefix Tuning  Li & Liang (2021) , and P-Tuning  Liu et al. (2022) , as shown in Figure  3 . LoRA reduces the number of parameters that need to be trained during the fine-tuning process by freezing all the original parameters and injecting a pair of low-rank decomposition matrices next to the original weights. Prefix Tuning adds trainable \"prefix\" tokens related to specific tasks as an implicit learnable prompt to the input sequence of the LLM, inserting trainable free vectors into each layer of the Transformer.

(2020a)  series model, in particular, demonstrates an improved understanding of the sentiment content of text after instruction tuning. Recent research  Peng et al. (2024)  focuses on exploring the different PEFT methods, adopting the LoRA and P-tuning methods to finetuning ChatGLM2  GLM et al. (2024) . Experimental results demonstrate that after instruction tuning, LLMs are greatly improved in eight datasets compared with the model without instruction tuning. However, the experimental results must conclusively determine which instruction tuning method is more effective in enhancing performance on PC.\n\nWhile these studies demonstrate LLMs' effectiveness in PC and EC tasks, it is equally important to understand their underlying sentiment processing mechanisms. Research shown that words with sentiment information can influence the overall sentiment of the text  Gan et al. (2023) . Building on this understanding, LLMs leverage techniques of instruction   2024 ) allows the addition of two trainable vectors, d and b, augmenting the LoRA layer.

Traditional PLMs often design a separate module for each ABSA subtask, which reduces the correlation between ABSA subtasks. LLMs can leverage their strong generalization abilities to construct a unified framework for all ABSA subtasks.\n\nRecent research explore this potential. InstructABSA introduces Instruction tuning based on the T𝑘-Instruct model  Wang et al. (2022)  for ABSA. This study finds that LLMs are sensitive to different instructions, with experimental results fluctuating by up to 10%  Scaria et al. (2023) .  ITSCL Zhang et al. (2024b)  is based on the T5 model and performs unified encoding of emotions and opinions. It introduces contrastive learning loss at each layer of the model to differentiate the feature vectors of different emotions and entity labels, thereby enhancing the model's performance. In addition to strengthening the correlations between ABSA tasks, large language models can leverage their extensive world knowledge to enhance information exchange across different domains. Some reseraches  Ding et al. (2024)  propose an ABSA cross-domain learning fine-tuning framework. In the first stage, domain knowledge is used to train the domain variation adapter, while replay data is used to train the domaininvariant adapter, employing orthogonal constraints to force the model to learn the differences between domain-invariant and domain-variant knowledge. In the second stage, all replay data will be used to train the domain-invariant adapter while freezing the corresponding domain variation adapter. This two-stage fine-tuning effectively utilizes knowledge from different domains and avoids the issue of forgetting previous domain knowledge. The model achieved the best performance across 19 datasets.\n\nThe ABSA task shares similar objectives with sentiment analysis and sentiment polarity analysis. Unisa aims to build a unified multimodal emotion analysis model that integrates various sentiment analysis tasks  Li et al. (2023b) .

Additionally, InstructERC creates two auxiliary tasks, speaker identification and emotion impact prediction, to enhance the model's understanding of speaker information. This model performs very well on the  MELD Poria et al. (2019a)  and EmoryNLP  Zahiri & Choi (2018)  datasets.\n\nResearchers extend ERC tasks to incorporate multimodal inputs, considering the frequently multimodal aspects of human communication, leading to the development of Multimodal Emotion Recognition in Conversation (MERC). Dia-logueLLM  Zhang et al. (2023h)  generates text descriptions of visual information through GPT-4, combines these descriptions with the conversation history as an instruction dataset, and uses LoRA to train LLaMA2.

This task aims to extract potential causes behind certain emotions in text, but its application scenarios are significantly limited due to the need for annotating emotional information. To address this issue, the Emotion-Cause Pair Extraction (ECPE) task propose. The ECPE task simultaneously extracts potential Emotion-Cause pairs and their corresponding causes within a document, thereby reducing the dependence on emotion labels  Xia & Ding (2019b) . Most current research on ECPE tasks involves fine-tuning traditional PLMs  Ding et al. (2020) ;  Wei et al.

These methods primarily focus on the Textual Emotion-Cause Pair Extraction in Conversations task (TECPE). However, emotion causes may also be embedded in other modalities, leading to the development of Multimodal Emotion-Cause Pair Extraction in Conversations task (MECPE)  Wang et al. (2024c) . LLMs shows potential in better integrating information from multiple modalities for such tasks.\n\nRecent work on multimodal emotion-cause understanding has progressed from clause extraction to explicit cause generation.

The study investigates ten open-source models and seven prompting schemes, revealing exciting conclusions. These include the fact that LLMs are competitive with indomain supervised models and that the fine-tuning process only sometimes leads to better performance than zero-shot models. This is likely because the fine-tuning makes the model too specialized, thus unable to generalize to out-ofdomain data points and varying stance definitions. In the opinion expression task,  STOEI Jia et al.

LLMs must to possess high emotional intelligence to resonate with users in their replies. However, due to the limitations of the dataset and its relative homogeneity, the generated responses often tend to be formulaic and mechanical, resulting in lower interaction quality. Some researchers aim to construct a more diverse empathetic dialogue dataset. Considering the high labor costs associated with manually constructing datasets, some current studies utilize LLM-generated synthetic data to build high-quality empathetic dialogue datasets.  Zheng et al. (2023b) ;  Wang et al. (2023b) ;  Zhang et al. (2024f) .\n\nTo enlarge training resources for empathetic dialogue, several works exploit LLM-driven self-augmentation. SoulChat  Chen et al. (2023b)  iteratively prompts GPT-3.5-turbo to grow multi-turn exchanges, yielding richer emotional trajectories.  EKTC Cao et al. (2025)  constructs the ED-TooL dataset by asking LLaMA3 to label the exact moments at which external tools should be invoked; the resulting high-quality tool-call exemplars are then used for instruction-fine-tuning, enabling models to decide autonomously-and more cleanly-when tool usage will enhance their responses. In the task of empathetic responses, the information dimension carried by a single text modality is relatively limited. Stickers and voice can convey non-verbal cues in interpersonal communication, and multimodal interaction mechanisms hold significant value in enhancing empathetic expression. StickerConv generates a multi-scenario, multimodal empathetic dialogue dataset constructed from user information through a multi-agent system, enabling more natural and fluid interactions with users by generating stickers within the dialogue  Zhang et al. (2024f) .\n\nSpeech-centric approaches further exploit prosody to boost empathy. BLSP-Emo  Wang et al. (2024a)  follows a two-step alignment strategy: (i) convert the speaker's audio into an explicit textual emotion hint and let an LLM draft a reply; (ii) apply QLoRA to inject the raw audio encodings themselves, forcing the model to ground its responses directly in vocal affect. PerceptiveAgent  Yan et al. (2024)  transcribes prosodic features with an audio-encoder-text-decoder pair, feeds the resulting description together with dialogue history to an LLM, and finally vocalises the generated reply via a synthesiser-thus closing the speech-to-speech loop. EMOVA  Chen et al. (2024a)  generalises this pipeline to multimodal inputs and, crucially, lets the model emit style tokens that steer the synthesiser, yielding richer and more engaging emotional speech.",

Consequently, researchers began exploring the development of a general AC model.\n\nDue to the high similarity of mission objectives and approach in affective understanding tasks, researchers try to build a unified model that can accomplish tasks simultaneously. Emollms  Liu et al. (2024c)  develops a multi-task instruction dataset, AAID, covering SA and ERC. Experimental results show improved performance on each task after multi-task training. GSA-7B  Hou et al. (2024)  undergoes progressive LoRA training on three tasks, SA, ERC, and SD that are both related and increasingly challenging. It has been found that this hierarchical training approach can effectively improve the model's performance across multiple tasks. In addition to classification tasks,  M2SE Li et al. (2024a)  also introduces tasks such as sentiment cause extraction, achieving a unified fine-tuning framework for multimodal and multitask scenarios. By sharing model parameters and facilitating knowledge transfer between tasks, it enhances the model's ability to generalize in complex emotional contexts. This model is applicable to various emotion computation tasks.\n\nHowever, current fine-tuning methods present limitations when dataset sources differ across tasks. Fine-tuning a model under these conditions can create conflicts and impact the original world knowledge embedded in the model  Li et al. (2024b) . These challenges highlight the need for more research on ensuring high-quality performance across all sentiment analysis tasks. To address these issues, researchers propose a novel Modular Emotional Intelligence enhancement method (MoEI) featuring two collaborative techniques-Modular Parameter Expansion (MPE) and Intra-Inter Modulation (I 2 M)-is proposed to fit most emotion analysis tasks  Zhao et al. (2024b) . In conjunction with this method, the study develops EIBENCH, a unified affective computing dataset containing 88 datasets across 15 EI-related tasks, is introduced. MoEI adopts the Mixture-of-LoRA (MoLoRA) method for fine-tuning to improve EI while maintaining the generative ability of the model.\n\nIn multimodality, MEILLMDong et al.

This section reviews recent advances in prompt engineering for AC, focusing on four techniques: zero-shot prompting, few-shot prompting, Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting, and agent.\n\nZero-shot Prompting  Brown et al. (2020)  generates text for a specific topic or domain without any demonstrations. It is simple to use, highly adaptable, and especially suitable for scenarios where data are scarce or hard to obtain.\n\nFew-shot Prompting  Brown et al. (2020)  supplies the model with a small set of task-relevant examples or demonstrations. These examples, together with the task description, are used as prompts to help the model better understand the task, reason more effectively, and produce high-quality outputs.\n\nChain-of-Thought  Wei et al. (2022b)  adopts a multi-step reasoning paradigm that guides the LLMs to reason logically and explicitly reveal the intermediate steps of its reasoning chain. Chain-of-Thought enables LLMs to better leverage context, produce more accurate and interpretable answers, and perform better on complex reasoning tasks.\n\nAgent  Park et al. (2023)  assigns clear roles, objectives, and collaboration protocols to multiple LLMs, driving them to collaborate via message passing and feedback loops to complete tasks. Agent effectively handles task decomposition and planning, tool invocation, and memory management, and excels in open-domain, multi-stage, highly interactive scenarios.\n\nWhile these prompting paradigms share commonalities, they differ in emphasis and application contexts. Zero-shot prompting directs the model with task instructions alone, without examples. Few-shot prompting appends a small number of exemplars to the instruction to align format and decision boundaries. Chain-of-thought prompting explicitly exposes intermediate reasoning steps or uses trigger phrases to elicit step-by-step thinking. Agent methods orchestrate a workflow of one or more agents and tools to support task decomposition, planning, memory, and self-verification, and to aggregate multiple outputs.

To address this, researchers introduce CoT  Lee et al. (2024) , which explicitly adds intermediate reasoning steps to better handle complex tasks. Given the complexity of AU,  THOR Fei et al. (2023)  employs a threehop CoT framework for Implicit Sentiment Analysis (ISA).\n\nIt sequentially extracts fine-grained aspects, analyzes latent opinions, and infers implicit sentiment. In addition, injecting causal relations as causal cues into the model  Lyu et al. (2024)  can enhance LLMs' sentiment analysis performance. Unlike traditional methods that extract regularities directly from text, Chain of Empathy (CoE)  Lee et al. (2023b)  combines multiple psychotherapeutic approaches  Beck (1979) ;  Linehan (1987) ;  Cooper & McLeod (2011) ;  Wubbolding et al. (2017) , designs four types of chains of thought, and interprets users' psychological states within a professional framework, thereby enabling a more precise understanding and handling of emotions. Meanwhile, other work  Manzoor et al. (2024)  adopts a psychological information-mining perspective and explores LLMs' potential for empathetic understanding. ECR-Chain  Huang et al. (2024)  draws on appraisal theory's \"stimulus-appraisal-emotion\" process and employs multistep reasoning to infer the deeper causes of emotions.\n\nMethods such as CoE and ECR-Chain generate taskspecific reasoning and achieve good results, but they still face challenges on complex extraction tasks such as Joint Aspect Sentiment Analysis (JASA) and Emotion-Cause Pair Extraction (ECPE). Accordingly, RP-CoT  Wang & Luo (2023)  adopts multi-step reasoning to decompose the task: it first identifies aspect-level sentiment polarities and then determines the overall polarity. Likewise, DECC  Wu et al. (2024b)  first detects emotions and locates the corresponding emotion clauses, and then, for each emotion, selects the most probable cause clause and outputs emotion-cause pairs. Beyond generating intermediate reasoning for emotion understanding and task decomposition, CoT also supports prompt construction. The Evolutionary Multi-Objective (EMO) process  Baumann & Kramer (2024)  starts from human-written seed prompts, feeds them to an LLM and evaluates fitness via the generated stories. It then performs crossover recombination and applies mutation operators, iteratively producing new prompts.\n\nThe CoT can be combined with few-shot prompting. For Market Sentiment Analysis  Chen et al. (2018) , the complexity of financial and social-media terminology and data scarcity constrain traditional supervised methods. Researchers construct contextual exemplars and use few-shot prompts to elicit CoT summaries  Deng et al. (2023a) , prompting the model to retrieve and integrate domain knowledge before concluding and thereby injecting relevant financial knowledge into the Market Sentiment Analysis.",

The generator injects reasoning and provides decisions with rationales, the discriminator explains and assesses credibility, and the two iterate until they reach consensus, leveraging model complementarity for more accurate emotion interpretation and correction.

Reinforcement learning is applied at the state level, enabling strategic emotional control and producing more empathetic and context-aware responses. Extending into the multimodal domain,  Zhao et al. Zhao et al. (2025a) present R1-Omni, which applies RLVR to omni-multimodal (video, audio, text)  emotion recognition. With a simple verifiable reward-whether predictions match ground-truth labels-optimized via Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO), the framework improves accuracy, robustness, and interpretability in emotion reasoning.\n\nPushing the boundaries of affective understanding beyond static emotion recognition, the SAGE (Sentient Agent as a Judge) framework  Zhang et al. (2025a)  reconceptualizes comprehension as a dynamic, interactive process. Its core innovation is a \"Sentient Agent\" that simulates human-like emotional changes and inner thoughts during multi-turn conversations. By embedding evaluation within the agent's evolving persona, goals, and emotional state, comprehension is reframed from classification to a stateful simulation of a user \"feeling understood.\" The resulting emotion trajectories and interpretable inner thoughts provide a proxy for modeling and measuring the essence of being heard.\n\nMost RL applications in affective computing focus on generation, steering LLMs toward empathetic, polite, or strategically effective outputs. RLHF naturally fits this domain by embedding human preferences into the training loop. For example, RLVER by  Wang et al. Wang et al. (2025b)  introduces the first end-to-end RL framework leveraging verifiable emotion rewards from simulated users. Built upon the SAGE simulator, it produces deterministic emotion scores as direct PPO rewards, elevating a 7B open-source model to near-proprietary performance on Sentient-Benchmark. A key innovation in RLVR is finer-grained reward design.  Li et al. Li et al. (2024e)  propose TOLE, which formulates token-level rewards via classifier probability shifts, enabling efficient controllable text generation.  Cai Cai et al. (2024) 's EmpCRL combines empathy and diversity signals, while  Li et al. Li et al. (2024c)  integrate the \"Cognitive Relevance Principle\" into ORL, balancing helpfulness against user effort. Together these works show how automated, dense rewards lead to nuanced affective generation.  Ma et al. Ma et al. (2025)  propose EmpRL, aligning response empathy levels through a programmatic reward from a dedicated \"empathy identifier,\" based on reaction, interpretation, and exploration.  Chang et al. Chang et al. (2024)  further demonstrate multi-objective reward design in emotional support systems, combining goallevel, flow, and valence rewards for stage-aware dialogue policies. RLVR also supports domain-specific agents.  Mishra et al. Mishra et al. (2024)  introduce ABLE, a disability support agent guided by a six-component reward model covering persona consistency, politeness, empathy, naturalness, and coherence.  Priya et al. Priya et al. (2025)  develop GENTEEL-NEGOTIATOR, which uses MoE-based RL with detailed reward functions for polite yet strategic negotiation. For online safety,  Wang et al. Wang et al. (2024d)  present F 2 RL, leveraging triplet-based factuality and multi-aspect faithfulness rewards to generate effective counterspeech.\n\nBeyond dialogue, RLVR principles extend into strategic decision-making. Unnikrishnan et al.  Unnikrishnan (2024)  apply sentiment-aware RL to portfolio management, where sentiment scores from financial news served as programmatic rewards. The resulting trading agent achieved superior profitability, showing how effective signals can optimize complex, non-dialogue tasks.",

      "text": "Within the RLVR paradigm, Reinforcement Learning from AI Feedback (RLAIF) replaces human annotators with capable AI models to provide reward signals.  Yoshida et al. Yoshida et al. (2025)  exemplify this approach by training an LLM-based reward model on 12 conversational metrics (e.g., empathy, consistency, enjoyability). This AI-generated, multi-faceted feedback is then used with DPO to optimize dialogue agents, showing that AI feedback can scalably capture holistic qualities beyond turn-level scoring.\n\nRLVR also supports new agent architectures.  Yuan Yuan et al. (2024)  propose ReflectDiffu, integrating RL into diffusion models where a policy network selects empathetic intents conditioned on emotional contagion and mimicry. High-level planning approaches include  Deng Deng et al. (2023c) 's Plug-and-Play Policy Planner and  Rakib Rakib et al. (2025) 's DialogXpert, which employ LLM critics in self-play to train efficient policy planners for proactive tasks such as emotional support and negotiation. The paradigm further extends to autonomous self-improvement. Ye et al.  Ye et al. (2025)  propose a self-evolution framework where models refine their own outputs to generate synthetic preference pairs for DPO.  Zhao et al. Zhao et al. (2025b)  advance this idea with Chain-of-Strategy Optimization (CSO), which uses Monte Carlo Tree Search to explore conversational strategies. Candidate responses are scored by an auxiliary reward model, yielding high-quality preference datasets for DPO fine-tuning, significantly improving strategic empathy.  Zhang et al. Zhang et al. (2025b)  introduce Decoupled ESC, featuring Inferential Preference Mining (IPM) that identifies psychological errors (e.g., lack of empathy, premature shifts) in model outputs. Erroneous responses are paired with ground-truth ones to build synthetic preference data. The resulting decoupled system, with separate strategy planning and response generation, yields more robust and effective emotional support agents. Collectively, these works illustrate the trajectory of RLAIF toward fully autonomous systems capable of continuously enhancing emotional intelligence.",

This poses a major scalability bottleneck, especially for fine-grained affective tasks that require nuanced and subjective judgments.\n\n• Many current reward functions used in RLHF and RLVR are designed based on task-level or surface-level attributes (e.g., helpfulness, politeness), but they often lack grounding in psychological or cognitive theories of emotion. This can lead to misalignment between the reward signal and the underlying affective dynamics, limiting the depth of emotional understanding or expression the model can achieve.\n\n• Despite advances in RL for affective understanding (e.g., RL-EMO, SAGE), temporal affect modeling remains underexplored. Emotions evolve over time, yet most RLbased affective systems still optimize at the turn-level or token-level, failing to capture long-term emotional trajectories in conversation.\n\n• The lack of standardized benchmarks and evaluation metrics for affective RL makes it difficult to systematically compare approaches or track progress. Current evaluations often rely on subjective human scoring or limited automatic proxies, which may not fully reflect emotional richness, coherence, or alignment with human expectations.",
