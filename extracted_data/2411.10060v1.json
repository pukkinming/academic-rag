      "text": "Multimodal emotion recognition in conversation (MER) aims to accurately identify emotions in conversational utterances by integrating multimodal information. Previous methods usually treat multimodal information as equal quality and employ symmetric architectures to conduct multimodal fusion. However, in reality, the quality of different modalities usually varies considerably, and utilizing a symmetric architecture is difficult to accurately recognize conversational emotions when dealing with uneven modal information. Furthermore, fusing multi-modality information in a single granularity may fail to adequately integrate modal information, exacerbating the inaccuracy in emotion recognition. In this paper, we propose a novel Cross-Modality Augmented Transformer with Hierarchical Variational Distillation, called CMATH, which consists of two major components, i.e., Multimodal Interaction Fusion and Hierarchical Variational Distillation. The former is comprised of two submodules, including Modality Reconstruction and Cross-Modality Augmented Transformer (CMA-Transformer), where Modality Reconstruction focuses on obtaining high-quality compressed representation of each modality, and CMA-Transformer adopts an asymmetric fusion strategy which treats one modality as the central modality and takes others as auxiliary modalities. The latter first designs a variational fusion network to fuse the fine-grained representations learned by CMA-Transformer into a coarse-grained representations. Then, it introduces a hierarchical distillation framework to maintain the consistency between modality representations with different granularities. Experiments on the IEMOCAP and MELD datasets demonstrate that our proposed model outperforms previous state-of-the-art baselines.

      "text": "Emotion Recognition in Conversation (ERC) aims to identify the corresponding emotion of each utterance in a conversation. It has become a critical problem in recent years due to its potential applications in social media analysis  (Kumar, Dogra and Dabas, 2015) , recommendation systems  (Xu, Yang, Han, Wang, Zhuang and Xiong, 2018; Zheng, Zhao, Zhu and Qian, 2022) , healthcare services  (Pujol, Mora and Martínez, 2019) , and affective computing systems  (Zhou, Gao, Li and Shum, 2020) .\n\nEarly research works usually assume that the emotion of the current utterance depends on its surrounding utterances as well as the speaker's emotional state. DialogueRNN  (Majumder, Poria, Hazarika, Mihalcea, Gelbukh and Cambria, 2019 ) presents a RNN-based neural network to keep track of individual party states. DialogueGCN  (Ghosal, Majumder, Poria, Chhaya and Gelbukh, 2019 ) models inter-and self-party dependency with a graph convolutional network to capture emotional inertia of individual speakers. Although these methods demonstrates impressive performance in emotion recognition, they only focus on unique modality (i.e., textual modality).\n\nIn recent years, multimodal emotion recognition in conversation has attracted considerable attention which attempts to model emotions of utterances by utilizing multiple modality information, such as textual, audio, and visual cues. Recent works mainly employ transformer mechanisms  (Lian, Liu and Tao, 2021; Zou, Huang and Shen, 2023)  or interaction graphs  (Hu, Liu, Zhao and Jin, 2021; Hu, Hou, Wei, Jiang and Mo, 2022; Nguyen, Nguyen, Le and Ha, 2024; Tu, Xie, Liang, Wang and Xu, 2024)  to model interactive relationships across different modalities  (Ma, Wang, Lin, Zhang, Zhang and Xu, 2024) .  Lian et al. (2021)  apply a cross-modal transformer to capture intra-and inter-modal interactions.  Zou et al. (2023)  introduce a prompt transformer for cross-modal information interaction.  Hu et al. (2021)  propose a multimodal fused graph convolutional network to explore both multimodal and long-distance contextual information. Hu et al.  (Hu et al., 2022)   interactive graph network to enhance intra-and cross-modal interactions.\n\nDespite previous works have demonstrated promising results, they still suffer from several limitations: Firstly, they usually treat different modalities as equivalent quality and employ symmetric architectures to fuse information in these modalities. However, in reality, modality qualities would be various, and the symmetric fusion strategy inevitable leads to inferior performance. Secondly, existing fusion methods mainly focus on fusing multimodal information in a unique information granularity by employing a unique-stage fusion strategy. They ignore the rich multi-granularity information embedded in different modalities, including the fine-grained feature representation and the coarse-grained semantic representation.\n\nTo address the aforementioned issues, this paper proposes a novel Cross-Modality Augmented Transformer with Hierarchical Variational Distillation (CMATH). It consists of two major components: Multimodal Interaction Fusion module and Hierarchical Variational Distillation module. In the Multimodal Interaction Fusion module, we introduce a cross-modality augmented transformer (CMA-Transformer) for fine-grained feature-fusion. Different from previous symmetric fusion strategy, CMA-Transformer adopts an asymmetric fusion strategy, which treats one modality as the central modality and the others as auxiliary ones. To be specific, it attempts to enhance the quality of the central modality by exploring interaction information from these auxiliary modalities. We employ CMA-Transformer for each modality by taking it as the central modality, and obtain its augmented representation. In the Hierarchical Variational Distillation Module, we first introduce a variational fusion network for coarse-grained semantic information fusion, which takes the above augmented fine-grained feature representation for each modality as input and learns a multimodal Gaussian distribution. Then, we introduce a Hierarchical Distillation strategy to maintain the consistency between modality representations with different granularities to further enhance the effectiveness of the semantic distribution integration.\n\nTo validate the effectiveness of the proposed model CMATH, we conducted extensive experiments on two widely used datasest, i.e., IEMOCAP and MELD. Experimental results demonstrate that CMATH significantly outperforms all baseline methods and achieves the state-of-the-art performance. Specifically, the proposed method obtains 73.90% and 73.96% in terms of two metrices ( i.e., accuracy and weighted F1-score) on the dataset IEMOCAP, with the relative performance improvement of 4.84% and 4.55% over the best performance baseline AdalGN, respectively. We further carry out experiments to analyze the effectiveness of each component of CMATH in depth in order to explore their contribution to the performance of multimodal emotion recognition in conversation. In summary, the main contributions of this work are as follows:\n\n• We propose to treat different modalities as nonequivalent quality during the fusing process and propose a novel CMA-Transformer which fuses multi-modality in an asymmetric strategy. We focus on enhancing the quality of each modality by taking it as the central modality and exploiting the remaining modalities as auxiliary information.\n\n• We introduce a hierarchical variational distillation framework, which first leverages a light variational fusion module to extract coarse-grained semantic information by fusing the Gaussion distribution of each modality, and then applies a hierarchical distillation strategy to maintain the consistency between modality representations with different information granularities.\n\n• We validate the effectiveness of our proposed method on two widely used benchmark datasets, i.e., IEMO-CAP and MELD. Experimental results demonstrate its superiority over existing state-of-the-art methods.",

      "text": "Previous research efforts  (Majumder et al., 2019; Ghosal et al., 2019; Ma, Wang, Lin, Pan, Zhang and Yang, 2022)  on emotion recognition in conversation (ERC) mainly focus on unique modality, i.e., textual modality.  Majumder et al. (2019)  propose an attentive RNN called DialogueRNN which employs three GRUs, i.e., global GRU, party GRU and emotion GRU, to model the speaker, the preceding context and the preceding emotion.  Ghosal et al. (2019)  extend DialogueRNN by proposing DialogueGCN which explores the emotional inertia of each speaker via capturing both intra-and inter-speaker dependencies. Moreover, it incorporates the relative position of context utterances from the target utterance to model the influence of both past and future utterances.  Ma et al. (2022)  develop MVN which explores the emotion representation of the query utterance based on two dependencies, i.e., the word-level dependencies among utterances and the utterance-level dependencies in the context.\n\nSince a unique modality would provide insufficient information as compared to multimodal for ERC, recently there has been growing interest in multimodal emotion recognition in conversation. Despite an early concatenation operation can be applied for capturing multimodal features for the above-mentioned methods, they neglect the rich interaction information across different modalities and result in suboptimal results. To address the issue,  Lian et al. (2021)  utilize the transformer-based structure to capture intra-and inter-modal interactions among different modalities, and model temporal information in the utterance by considering both word-level lexical features and segment-level acoustic features.  Hu et al. (2021)  propose a multimodal fused graph convolutional network named MMGCN by creating a graph based on all modalities. It builds the connected graph in each modality and constructs edge connections between nodes across different modalities.  Hu et al. (2022)  leverage graph convolution operation to aggregate dynamics of contextual information of both intra-and inter-modality in a specific semantic space, and capture the intrinsic sequential patterns of contextual information in adjacent semantic space. By control information flow between layers, this method can reduce redundancy and boost complementarity between modalities.  Yang et al. (2023)  propose the self-adaptive context and modal-interaction modeling framework, which attempts to model different ranges of context dependency as well as captures the specific contribution of each modality.  Zou et al. (2023)  leverages audio and visual modalities as the prompt information for textual modality and designs a multimodal prompt transformer for cross-modal information interaction. Then a hybrid contrastive learning strategy is incorporated to improve the performance for less sample labels.  Nguyen et al. (2024)  attempt to integrate multimodal features by employing Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG), and introduce the curriculum learning strategy to handle emotional shifts and data imbalance.  Tu et al. (2024)  proposes an adaptive interactive graph network called AdaIGN by developing two selection policies, i.e., NSP and ESP, which learns a selection pattern for nodes and edges in a multimodal heterogeneous graph. Then a directed graph based fusion is adopted to prevent the influence of current utterance by future ones.\n\nThe main difference between these works and our proposed approach are two-folds. Firstly, existing works usually focus on fusing multimodal information in a symmetric framework which assumes different modalities have equivalent quality. Due to the varying quality of different modalities in real-world scenarios, we argue that it is more reasonable to conduct multimodal fusion in an asymmetric manner.\n\nTo the end, we propose a novel cross-modality augmented transformer (CMA-Transformer) by treating one modality as the central modality and the others as auxiliary ones. Secondly, different from existing works, we propose to learn modality representations with different granularities and develop a novel hierarchical distillation strategy to boost the effectiveness of the semantic distribution integration by maintaining the consistency between them.",

RoBERTa is an enhancement of the BERT, which utilizes a multi-layer transformer to learn textual representations. For feature representation, we adopt the embeddings of the [CLS] tokens in the final layer of RoBERTa, which is a feature vector with a dimensionality of 1024.\n\nAudio Modality: we utilize the OpenSMlLE Toolkit  (Eyben, Wöllmer and Schuller, 2010)  to extract acoustic features. OpenSMlLE serves as a versatile feature extraction framework designed for signal processing, which allows for the configuration of modular feature extraction components via a scriptable console application. After processing with OpenSMlLE, the dimensionality of the acoustic feature representation is reduced to 1582 for the IEMOCAP dataset  (Busso, Bulut, Lee, Kazemzadeh, Mower, Kim, Chang, Lee and Narayanan, 2008)  and 300 for the MELD dataset  (Poria, Hazarika, Majumder, Naik, Cambria and Mihalcea, 2019) .\n\nVisual Modality: we utilize the DenseNet  (Iandola, Moskewicz, Karayev and Keutzer, 2014)  for the extraction of visual features.

Specifically, we adopt a 1D convolutional layer for each modality to conduct down-sampling operation and obtain their corresponding compressed representations in the common space. Then another 1D convolutional layer is leveraged for each modality to conduct up-sampling operation and reconstruct the input representation.

Since speaker and positional information are crucial for emotion recognition in conversation  (Kim and Vossen, 2021) , we integrate them into modality features.

In addition, we also analyze the detailed results on each emotion category, and the results show that our model achieves superior or competitive performances on most emotion categories.",

Specifically, we introduce the following variants of CMATH to perform the comparison: • w/o MR: We replace the modality reconstruction module by a fully-connected layer, and still keep the speaker and positional information.\n\n• w/o CMA-T: We ignore the asymmetric fusion operation by discarding the CMA Transformer.\n\n• w/o LLD: We remove the low-level distillation part, and only consider the high-level distillation.\n\n• w/o HLD: We discard the high-level distillation part, and only keep the low-level distillation.\n\n• w/o HD: We ignore the consistency operation by discarding the hierarchical distillation.\n\nThe experimental results are shown in Table  4  and we can observe that CMATH achieves the best performance compared to each variant, which indicates the rationality of its design. Specifically, the modality reconstruction module helps to improve the performance by obtaining highquality compressed representation of each modality. Moreover, there is a significant performance decline if we remove the CMA-Transformer module, which demonstrates the effectiveness of incorporating the asymmetric fusion strategy. The performance drops on the IEMOCAP dataset is larger than on the MELD dataset. The reason may be attributed to the conversation length in the IEMOCAP dataset is considerably longer than those in the MELD dataset (as shown in Table  1 ), and CMA-Transformer is able to explore more interaction signals on IEMOCAP than on MELD. In addition, removing either the low-level distillation or the high-level distillation will result in performance degradation, which demonstrates that each distillation constraint plays a critical role in our model. Besides, removing both low-and high-level distillation parts will further lead to performance degradation compared to removing each of them.\n\nIt indicates that the low-and high-level distillation parts can compensates each other, and maintaining the consistency between modality representations with different granularities are crucial for the proposed model.",

We have the following observations. First, the performance of CMATH over the textual modality is significantly superior to the other two modalities according to unimodal results, which indicates that textual features play the most important role in the ERC task. Among all modalities, the performance on visual modality is the worst which reflects that its quality is relatively lower than other modalities. Second, when we implement CMATH based on any combination of two modalities, we can observe that the corresponding performance is much better than its counterpart solely on a unique modality. Third, the best performance is achieved when all three modalities are leveraged simultaneously. This result confirms that our model can reasonably integrating information from different modalities.",

For IEMOCAP, in the beginning, the performance of CMATH improves gradually as a higher size of embedding dimension is adopted, and reaches to the peak when the dimension size equals to 500. After that, the performance starts to decline as the dimension size continues to increase. For MELD, we can observe a similar trend of performance, where the best performance is obtained when the dimension size equals to 400.

We perform grid search over combinations of 𝛾 1 and 𝛾 2 by varying them from 1.0 to 2.0 with a step of 0.2, and the results are depicted in Figure  6 . We observe that our proposed model achieves the best performance when 𝛾 1 = 1.0 (1.0) and 𝛾 2 = 1.8 (1.2) on the IEMOCAP (MELD) dataset in terms of the metric W-F1. This result indicates that imposing consistency constraints between modalities on the decision representation spaces.

To be specific, on the IEMOCAP dataset, we observe that there are 48 misclassified samples for the class \"Angry\", among which most of them (i.e., 42 samples) are misclassified to the class \"Frustrated\". This may be attributed to the high similarity between the two classes. Similar observations can be found for the pair of classes, i.e., \"Happy\" and \"Excited\". On the MELD dataset, we find that most of the misclassified samples for each classes fall into the class \"Neutral\".
