      "text": "Quantum fluctuations are fundamental in quantum technologies, affecting computing, sensing, cryptography, and thermodynamics. These include fluctuations in the variation of energy, charge, and other observables driven by interactions with lasers and baths. Despite the precise rules quantum mechanics provides for measuring observables at instants of time, no standard framework exists for characterizing the fluctuations of their variations over time. This gap leads to inconsistencies in fluctuation predictions, impacting quantum technologies. In this work, we propose four basic criteria that any measurement of these variations must satisfy, grounded in conservation laws, the no-signaling principle, and expected constraints on physical realism. We demonstrate that only one protocol fulfills all these criteria: the two-times quantum observables. This result has the potential to establish the foundations for measurements of quantum processes, possibly resolving ambiguities in quantum fluctuation measurements. Moreover, it enables the extension of quantum information concepts, such as entanglement and Bell's inequalities, to processes rather than instantaneous observables.",

      "text": "Quantum fluctuations play an increasingly critical role in emerging devices  [1] , challenging the performance of quantum computers  [2] [3] [4] , sensors  [5] , and cryptographic systems  [6] . Central to control and predict these fluctuations is the ability to accurately characterize the variation of physical quantities (VPQs). For instance, in superconducting quantum computers, minimizing the impact of charge fluctuation is essential for ensuring reliable qubit performance  [2, 3] . Likewise, in quantum thermodynamics, the statistical characterization of VPQs, such as variation of energy and particle number variations, is vital for refining fluctuation theorems and extending thermodynamic and conservation laws into the quantum realm  [1, [7] [8] [9] [10] [11] [12] [13] [14] [15] . Remarkably, despite significant advancements, there remains no universal and standard framework for characterizing the statistics of VPQs in quantum mechanics.\n\nTo illustrate this challenge, consider the simple task of describing the statistics of the variation of a quantum observable O for an arbitrary system S evolving under unitary dynamics U t until an arbitrary time t. Quantum mechanics provides a standard protocol for measuring O at any time for any given initial quantum state ρ: by considering the eigenstates |o n ⟩ of O, we can define the probability of obtaining a measurement outcome o k at time t as p(o k , ρ, t) = ⟨o k | U t ρU † t |o k ⟩. p(o k , ρ, t) fully characterizes the statistics of O at any given time. On the other hand, quantum mechanics provides no standard method for calculating the statistics of the variation of O over the interval  [0, t] . This is because the variation of O is a quantity non-local in time, and it is unclear how to measure it without the measurement itself disturbing it. For instance, a common approach to measure such variations is the two-point measurement (TPM) protocol  [14] [15] [16] [17] [18] [19]  (see  Fig 1.  for a theoretical example in trapped ions). Based on TPM, the system S, initially in state ρ, undergoes a projective measurement of O at t = 0, yielding an outcome o n . After being measured, the system evolves under U t until t, where a second measurement of O is done resulting in o m (See the top of Figs.  1a  and 1b ). The variation ∆o mn = o mo n is computed for this arbitrary run, and repeating this protocol many times allows us to construct the probability of the variation of O of having any arbitrary value.\n\nAlthough intuitive, the TPM approach has several drawbacks. Perhaps the most important one is that the initial measurement collapses any superpositions in ρ with respect to the eigenbasis of O. This can lead TPM to fail to respect conservation laws  [17, 18, 21] , as demonstrated in Fig.  1  and the \"Methods\" section. These and other limitations  [22, 23]  have prompted the development of alternative methodologies for describing the statistics of VPQs, including the well-known full-counting statistics  [24] , quasi-probabilities  [25] , Gaussian pointers  [26] , and two-time observables  [21] [22] [23] [27] [28] [29] , among others  [18] . These approaches, however, often produce conflicting results, raising critical concerns for both foundational physics and practical applications. Indeed, because they provide contradictory predictions, it is unclear which approach, if any, accurately reflects the underlying physics. Also, in the absence of a standardized protocol, physical conclusions risk being influenced more by the measurement procedure chosen itself than by the process under investigation (e.g., the example in Fig.  1 ). Furthermore, the lack of a reliable standard has critical implications for quantum technologies. Predictions must be accurate and consistent across diverse scenarios to ensure quantum devices' functionality and resource efficiency-faulty or overly demanding predictions can undermine their practical feasibility.\n\nWithout a universally accepted standard methodology, grounding protocols in fundamental principles of physics offers a clear and reliable criterion to ensure their consistency and applicability across diverse scenarios  [12, 17, 22, [30] [31] [32] . Motivated by this, we propose four fundamental properties that any consistent protocol for measuring VPQs should satisfy ensuring conservation laws, the no-signaling principle, and expected constraints on physical realism. By assuming these criteria, we prove that there is a unique measurement protocol able to meet all principles simultaneously: the twotimes quantum observable protocol  [21] [22] [23] [27] [28] [29] . This protocol can thus serve as the necessary standard measurement FIG.  1 . Violation of energy conservation in TPM protocol. The system Ω consists of a trapped Ca + ion model inspired in the Ref.  [20] .\n\nThe total energy of the system is H = H HO + H e . H HO = ℏω(N + 1/2) ⊗ 1 s is the energy related with the center of mass (CM). The position of the CM is coupled to the spin of a covalent electron (red arrow) through a spin-dependent optical dipole force (ODF), with a coupling energy approximately H e ≈ ℏ(ω z /2 + ∆ S k SW X/2) ⊗ σ z  [20] . One round of the TPM measurement of the variations of H HO and H e are represented in the above part of figures a and b, respectively. After collecting the results of many rounds of experiments, we represent in the lower graphs the two highest values of the probabilities p TPM (z, H i , U τ , ρ) of the energies H i ∈ {H HO , H e } of varying z during the evolution U τ for the initial state ρ. Energy conservation requires the increase of H HO to be equal to the decrease of H e . However, a and b reveal that TPM predicts H HO to be less likely to increase by ℏω than protocol to compute VPQs.",

      "text": "In our framework, we consider a general system Ω, comprising arbitrary subsystems, prepared in an arbitrary quantum state ρ acting on a Hilbert space H. Ω evolves from time 0 to t under an arbitrary unitary operator U, with a countable eigenbasis. We focus on describing the measurement of the variation of a specific part of the total energy of the whole system Ω, described by a time-independent Hermitian operator H 1 acting on H (see examples in Fig.  2 ). This framework and the following results, however, readily extend to the variation of any other quantum observable, such as particle number, momentum, or angular momentum.\n\nWe first clarify what we mean by a measurement protocol. In quantum mechanics, measurements can be generally described by positive operator-valued measures (POVMs)  [33] [34] [35] . Following this perspective, we define a measurement protocol M  [17]  to measure the variation of any arbitrary energy operator H 1 under an arbitrary evolution U.\n\nFor the protocol M and for each (H 1 , U) pair, the set M(H 1 , U) = {M(z, H 1 , U)} defines a POVM whose opera-tors satisfy ∞ -∞ dzM(z, H 1 , U) = 1 and M(z, H 1 , U) ≥ 0. In this framework, the probability density of observing a variation z of H 1 under U is ℘(z, H 1 , U, ρ) = Tr[M(z, H 1 , U)ρ], for the initial state ρ. By the POVM properties, it follows that ∞ -∞ dz℘(z, H 1 , U, ρ) = 1 and ℘(z, H 1 , U, ρ) ≥ 0. This approach aims to keep the protocol as general as possible, so that M applies universally.\n\nAn important example of a measurement protocol is the two-times observables (OBS) protocol, denoted by MOBS. This protocol operates as follows: for any given energy operator H 1 and unitary evolution U over time t, the variation of energy is defined by the two-time quantum observable  [21] [22] [23] :\n\nrepresenting the difference between the Heisenberg picture operators U † H 1 U and H 1 at times t and 0. ∆(H 1 , U) is a Hermitian operator, with eigenvalues {δ j (H 1 , U)} and corresponding eigenvectors {|δ j (H 1 , U)⟩}, as expressed in the decomposition ∆(H 1 , U) = j δ j (H 1 , U) |δ j (H 1 , U)⟩ ⟨δ j (H 1 , U)|.\n\nThe probability of finding a specific eigenvalue δ j (H  In other words, if the sum of energies H 1 + H 2 is conserved under U, then the probability of H 1 of increasing an amount z must equal the probability of H 2 of decreasing the same amount. This condition ensures that conservation laws hold at the level of probability distributions instead of just on average. In light of the Wigner-Araki-Yanase (WAY) theorem  [8, 9] , it is interesting to note that this condition allows for the possibility that the measurement process may, in specific rounds, disturb the subsystem's energy or even not be repeatable. However, even with such single-shot disturbances, we assume that conservation laws remain preserved, ensuring no statistically detectable violation in the energy balance (see Fig.  4a ).\n\n2. Reality: Consider any system Ω, operator H 1 and evolution U. If the initial state is ρ = |e⟩ ⟨e| such that |e⟩ is an eigenvector of both H 1 and U † H 1 U with respective eigenvalues e and ϵ, then the POVM must result in the probabilities ℘(z, H 1 , U, ρ) = δ D [z -(ϵe)] for this specific ρ = |e⟩ ⟨e|. In other words, if H 1 is well-defined (or real, in an EPR-sense  [36] ) at both the start and end of the process, the variation should be precisely the difference between the initial and final eigenvalues (see Fig.  4b ). 3. Independence of the initial state: For any system Ω, operators H 1 , and evolution operators U, the elements of the POVM M(z, H 1 , U) must not depend on the initial state ρ. This condition is generally satisfied in quantum mechanics  [33] [34] [35]  and ensures that the measurement apparatus is not adjusted based on the initial preparation of the system  [12, 17, 18, 22]  (see Fig.  4c ). Notably, this condition is equivalent to requiring that the elements {M(z, H 1 , U)} of the POVM M(H 1 , U) are linear with respect to ρ  [17] .",

For any such system and every energy operator\n\nIn other words, local statistics of H 1 should remain unaffected by changes (U ′ ) in another subspace, ensuring that no statistically detectable information is transmitted between different subspaces via the measurement process  [37, 38]  (see Fig.  4d ). This condition should be crucial in setups where additional auxiliary subsystems are introduced to assist measurements  [26, 39] .\n\nA measurement protocol that satisfies all four conditions (1-4) is referred to as an CRIN protocol. We are now in position to establish the main result of this work:\n\nResult 1. The OBS protocol is the only protocol that satisfies the CRIN conditions.\n\nThe proof of this result is presented in the \"Methods\" section and further detailed in the Supplementary Material (SM)  [40] . Importantly, the result is not confined to energy variations-it extends to the variation of any quantum observable, such as linear and angular momentum, or particle number. Additionally, we demonstrate in the SM that the result holds for explicitly time-dependent observables, with the CRIN conditions appropriately adapted for such cases.\n\nResult 1 may offer valuable insights into the foundations of the measurement of quantum processes. Since we expect the CRIN conditions to hold, then the OBS protocol emerges as the only consistent framework for determining the fluctuations of VPQs. Consequently, two-time observables must be considered to characterize variations in energy, charge, particle position, or other observables in quantum systems. Any deviation from the OBS protocol necessarily leads to the violation of at least one CRIN condition. For instance, as illustrated in Fig.  1 , the TPM protocol fails to satisfy condition 1, resulting in the statistical violation of energy conservation.\n\nInterestingly, since the statistical framework for two-time observables mirrors that of conventional \"one-time\" quantum observables, the CRIN conditions naturally extend standard quantum phenomena to two-time observables. For instance, by assuming the CRIN conditions, entanglement, steering, or quantum superposition can be considered within the scope of two-time quantum observables (see Refs.  [21, 23]  for a discussion). Furthermore, we can deduce a two-time uncertainty relation for any initial state ρ  [21] :\n\nwhere j ∈ {1, 2}, σ O = ⟨O 2 ⟩ -⟨O⟩ 2 is the variance of an observable O and ⟨O⟩ = Tr[Oρ] its expectation value. Remarkably, this leads to scenarios where the variation ∆(H j , U) can become perfectly defined (i.e., σ ∆(H j , U) → 0), even when the individual energies H j at 0 and U † H j U at t cannot be completely determinate (i.e., σ U † H j U + σ H j → ∞). The trapped ion example in Fig.  5  illustrates this behavior.\n\nAs demonstrated in Fig.  3 , the OBS protocol is derived by measuring an observable commuting with ∆(H 1 , U), allowing us to explicitly determine ℘ OBS (z, H 1 , U, ρ). However, in many experimental scenarios, direct measurements of certain quantities are impractical, and instead, indirect measurement schemes employing auxiliary probes are used  [19, 39] . A natural question arises: can the same ℘ OBS (z, H 1 , U, ρ) be obtained through the use of a probe to measure the energy? The second key result addresses this challenge: Result 2. For any U, H 1 acting on H, and eigenstate\n\nAlthough the absolute value of the energy variation is the same in both panels, the energy fluctuations in a are significantly larger than in b. This difference is consistent with Eq. (  3 ): in a, the commutator acting on H ⊗ H ′ , and a vector |v⟩ ∈ H ′ such that:\n\n, and E i and\n\nThe proof of this result is outlined in the \"Methods\" section and detailed in the SM  [40] .\n\nResult 2 reveals a significant insight into the interplay between the OBS protocol and the CRIN conditions, as examplified in Fig.  3 . When employing directly the OBS protocol for an energy operator H 1 without considering result 2, the measurement process projects the system into an eigenstate |δ i (H 1 , U)⟩, with the variation of energy inferred as δ i (H 1 , U). However, the variation δ i (H 1 , U) is not directly measured. Instead, the protocol relies on measuring an auxiliary observable O ∆ that commutes with ∆(H 1 , U), as illustrated in Fig.  3 . Considering result 2, an alternative perspective is offered, enabling a way to indirectly obtain the OBS statistics for ∆(H 1 , U) by means of a probe, while adhering to the CRIN conditions. Specifically, Result 2 guarantees the existence of a probe related with an auxiliary Hamiltonian H 2 and dynamics U ′ such that the total energy H 1 ⊗ 1 H ′ + H 2 is conserved un- der U ⊗ U ′ . Moreover, once the combined state |δ i (H 1 , U), v⟩ is prepared, it has well-defined values for H 2 at both times 0 and t, enabling the variation of H 2 to be precisely determined as -δ i (H 1 , U). By considering CRIN conditions 2 and 3, one can infer that the variation of H 2 is -δ i (H 1 , U) with 100% certainty (when disregarding practical experimental disturbances). Furthermore, conditions 1 and 4 ensure that this conclusion remains valid, as the conservation of H 1 ⊗1 H ′ + H 2 enforces the same probability for H 1 to vary by δ i (H 1 , U). This result applies universally to any observable O 1 and O 2 by substituting H 1 , H 2 → O 1 , O 2 in Result 2. While it may not always be practically feasible to design an experiment that implements the auxiliary Hamiltonian H 2 and unitary operator U ′ described in Result 2, there are scenarios where the result can be directly applied. One case of this class of examples is the trapped ion case illustrated in Figs.  1, 3 , and 5, as described in the SM  [40] .",

      "text": "To conclude, we have shown that the OBS protocol is unique in complying with the CRIN principles. Given the fundamental nature of these principles, we expect them to be fulfilled by any POVM protocol aiming to measure VPQs. In this sense, results 1 and 2 provide strong support for considering the OBS protocol as a standard for measuring variation of quantum observables.\n\nLooking forward, several promising directions emerge. For instance, our findings open intriguing directions for exploring the observable properties of two-time observables. Can Bell's inequalities applied to two-time observables reveal new insights for quantum cryptography protocols or uncover deeper aspects of quantum nonlocality? How does this framework connect with relativity principles? Moreover, could entanglement and other quantum correlations enhance the capabilities of quantum machines when applied to processes rather than instantaneous (one-time) observables? Since the OBS protocol is the only measurement scheme consistent with the CRIN conditions, these questions are not merely speculative, as they emerge naturally within a physically framework consistent with the CRIN conditions.\n\nAnother avenue is to apply the OBS protocol in quantum computing platforms  [2, 3, 41] , to gain insights into charge fluctuations and energy dissipation in quantum processors. Is it possible to approximate to eigenstates like |δ i (H 1 , U)⟩ with virtually no fluctuation in currents or energy variation in quantum devices? The OBS protocol framework also opens new possibilities for advancing measurement techniques in complex quantum systems. For instance, Result 2 demonstrated that attaching an auxiliary system governed by H 2 and U ′ can enable indirect measurement of variations of observables within a specific system. This approach could be extended to quantum many-body systems  [42] , where adding few extra degrees of freedom and leveraging conservation laws could provide insights into highly nontrivial observables. Moreover, our findings invite deeper questions about conservation laws and measurement precision. For example, the WAY theorem  [8, 9]  implies a fundamental tradeoff between energy conservation and the precise measurement of non-commuting observables. Could an auxiliary system be introduced, as in result 2, to restore energy conservation (by means of condition 1) while enabling precise measurements?\n\nIt is important to remark that the framework presented in this work is grounded in a universal perspective, with an open quantum system (OQS) part of a larger, closed universe treated as a special case (see Fig.  2a ). Adapting the OBS protocol to account for scenarios involving noise and environmental interactions, perhaps using the adjoint Lindblad generator  [43] , is a necessary step. Within this line of research, we are currently investigating the relation between the statistics of variation of observables and the lack of detailed balance at equilibrium (nonreciprocity) and persistent quantum currents  [52] .",

Third, if ρ 1 = |e 1 ⟩ ⟨e 1 | is an eigenstate of both H 1 and U † H 1 U, with eigenvalues e 1 and ϵ 1 , then |e 1 ⟩ is also an eigenstate of ∆(H 1 , U) with eigenvalue ϵ 1e 1 .

In this case, Condition 2 becomes ill-defined, as no normalized state ρ can simultaneously assign a well-defined energy value at both times.

Now, we show that using the permutation algorithm, we are able to define all θ ′ j in Eq. (  107 ). First, notice that by considering l = 1, then we have, from Eq. (  108 ) that k 1 = 1 and, using the permutation algorithm:\n\nSimilarly, for l = 2, it follows that k 2 = 4 and:\n\nFor l = 3, it follows that k 3 = 29 and so on. Now, there are two options for the basis of U: either it is countably infinite or finite.\n\nLet us first consider that U is diagonalized by an countably infinite basis. Consider that θ ′ p is defined for 1 ≤ p ≤ k n -1, where n is an arbitrary natural. Then, since the permutation algorithm used for the l = n, defines θ ′ p for all p such that k n ≤ p ≤ k n+1 -1, it follows that θ ′ p becomes defined for 1 ≤ p ≤ k n+1 -1. Therefore, by induction, we can repeat the procedure for arbitrary large l, and θ ′ p is defined for all p ≥ 1. The set Θ ′ containing all θ ′ p defined by this induction procedure is thus countably infinite. In the case that U is diagonalized by a countably finite basis of dimension D < ∞, it follows that θ j is defined for 1 ≤ j ≥ D. We can define an extension Θ e = Θ ∞ k=1 {θ D+k } of Θ by adding to it the extra variables\n\nand inductively repeat this procedure. In this case, θ ′ j can be defined using the same procedure as in the case in which U is diagonalized by a countably infinite basis, but considering the elements Θ e instead of Θ. Now, we prove that all sums of the form\n\nwith finite natural N ≥ 1 and finite integers m j , are inside Θ ′ . To prove this, notice that, because m j are finite, then there is an integer s such that |m j | ≤ s. There are two possibilities: either s ≥ N or s < N. Let us consider that s ≥ N. In this case, if we consider the permutation algorithm for l = s, then the set all possible combinations\n\nfor |i j | ≤ s will be contained in the set of all θ ′ k defined in the algorithm for l = s. Therefore, there is at least one θ ′ k defined in the algorithm for l = s equal to the sum in Eq. (  112 ): the sum in Eq. (  112 ) is contained in Θ ′ . Now, consider that s < N. If we consider the permutation algorithm for l = N, then the set all possible combinations\n\nfor |i j | ≤ N will be contained in the set of all θ ′ k defined in the algorithm for l = N. Therefore, there is at least one θ ′ k defined in the algorithm for l = N equal to the sum in Eq. (  112 ). Since N is arbitrary as well as m j then every combination as in Eq. (112) will be contained in Θ ′ .\n\nIt is also straightforward to show (just by looking at the permutation algorithm) that all θ ′ j ∈ Θ ′ are of the form of Eq. (  112 ). As a result, all terms inside Θ ′ are of the form of Eq. (  112 ) and all the terms of the form of Eq. (  112 ) are inside Θ ′ .\n\nTo prove condition 2, select arbitrary θ ′ j ∈ Θ ′ , θ k ∈ Θ, and θ q ∈ Θ. Because θ ′ j is inside Θ ′ , then it can be written as\n\nwhere N, and |m n | are finite.

Therefore, it acts on a space H ′ that satisfy Eq. (  105 ), whose set Θ ′ = {θ ′ j } of the arguments θ ′ j of its eigenvalues e iθ ′ j . Because of Lemma 1, we know that such U ′ can always be defined. We thus consider the components [\n\nTo prove our result, we want to define H 2 so as to make this expression to have a null value. In this sense, we recall that, because U ′ satisfy the U condition, then for any θ ′ j ∈ Θ ′ and for any m and k, there exist infinitely many l such that θ ′ l ∈ Θ ′ and\n\nAs a result, it follows that for any m, k and j, there exist infinitely many l such that (e i(θ k +θ ′ l )e i(θ m +θ ′ j ) ) = 0. Similarly, for any m, k and j, there exist infinitely many l such that (e i(θ k +θ ′ j )e i(θ m +θ ′ l ) ) = 0. For the cases in which (e i(θ k +θ ′ l )e i(θ m +θ ′ j ) ) = 0, we can consider any arbitrary value for ⟨u m , u ′ j | H 2 |u k , u ′ l ⟩ and still the following relation holds:\n\nAs a consequence, we can define the free complex variables h m jkl such that h klm j = h * m jkl , so that the components of H 2 are defined as\n\nfor the indexes\n\nand, by taking into account that H 1 is hermitian so that\n\nfor the indexes\n\nConsidering Eq.

Consider a state |v⟩ ∈ H ′ whose only requirement is that its components ⟨u ′ j |v⟩ in the basis |u ′ j ⟩ satisfy ℜ(⟨u ′ j |v⟩) 0 and ℑ(⟨u ′ j |v⟩) 0, i.e. the real and imaginary part of ⟨u ′ j |v⟩ are non-null. From Lemma 3 and the fact that the basis {|u ′ j ⟩} is countable, we can always define such |v⟩. Considering this |v⟩, we can thus analyze how to define the free variables h klm j = h * m jkl in (131) so that the eigenvalue/eigenvector equation\n\ncan be satisfied. For that, let us consider the components of (137) with respect to the specific element of the basis |u m , u ′ j ⟩:\n\nwhere we named α mi = ⟨u m |δ i (H 1 , U)⟩ and β j = ⟨u ′ j |v⟩.

(  137 ), then we need to properly define the free variables h m jkl so that Eq. (  139 ) holds. To do so, we first notice that there are only two possible alternatives: either α mi = 0 and α mi 0. We treat each of them separately.\n\nIn the case in which α mi = 0, for Eq. (  139 ) for m and any arbitrary j, it is necessary that\n\nholds. If |δ i (H 1 , U)⟩ is a null vector so that α ki = 0 for all k m, then Eq. (137) holds directly for any value of h m jkl . If, on the other hand, |δ i (H 1 , U)⟩ is not a null vector, then there must be at least one k m such that α ki 0. Moreover, since θ ′ j ∈ Θ ′ , then, from (129), for any m, k and j we can find infinitely many l such that θ ′ l ∈ Θ ′ and θ k + θ ′ l = θ m + θ ′ j mod 2π, i.e. such that {k, l} ∈ N m j . Therefore, there must exist a {k, l} ∈ N m j such that α ki 0. Furthermore, since, by the definition of |v⟩, β l 0 for all l, then for the specific m and j in Eq. (  140 ) such that α mi = 0, there exist {k, l} ∈ N m j and k m, such that α ki β l 0. As a result, the terms h m jkl , being complex variables, can always be tuned to satisfy the Eq. (  140 ) for all m and j such that α mi = 0. To show this, all we need is to show that there is at least one way of defining h m jkl that make Eq. (140) to hold. In this sense, consider the set N m j of all the elements {k, l} ∈ N m j such that α ki 0. Moreover, consider the indexes k and l as the smaller indexes in which k + l = min {k,l}∈N m j k + l. If there exist more then two duples { k′ , l′ } and { k′′ , l′′ } such that k′ + l′ = k′′ + l′′ = min {k,l}∈N m j k + l, then we denote { k, l} as the duple with smallest from k′ and k′′ . Let us define h m jkl for all m and j such that α mi = 0 as follows:\n\nDefining h m jkl in this way, Eq. (140) will hold for any m and j such that α mi = 0. Importantly, notice that these definitions will not alter the other components of Eq. (137). To check that, we consider any other components |u q , u ′ r ⟩ of Eq. (  137 ), such that {q, r} {m, j}:\n\nThe only way that Eq. (  142 ) can be dependent on the terms h m jkl for the specific m, j of Eq. (  140 ) or their complex conjugate h * m jkl = h klm j is either if, for the last sum in Eq. (142), we set (i) q = m, r = j, s = k, and n = l or (ii) q = k, r = l, s = m, and n = j. Since {q, r} {m, j} then the case (i) is already not valid. On the other hand, in the case in which we consider (ii), then h qrsn α si → h klm j α mi that will result in 0 for any h klm j , since α mi = 0. So that, Eq. (142) will be independent of h m jkl and h * m jkl = h klm j . Since this holds for any {q, r} {m, j}, then we proved that for any component |u m , u ′ j ⟩ of Eq. (  137 ) in which α mi = 0, we can define the independent variables h m jkl as in Eq. (  141 ) so as to make\n\nto hold, in a way that does not interfere in the other components |u q , u ′ r ⟩ |u m , u ′ j ⟩ of Eq. (137). We thus assume from now on h m jkl as in Eq. (  141 ) for all m such that α mi = 0. Now, let us consider the case in which α mi 0. In this case, we rewrite Eq. (  139 ) as\n\nwhere we denoted N ′ j as the set of indexes {l} such that θ ′ l = θ ′ j modulo 2π. Therefore, l ∈ N ′ j and l N ′ j means that e iθ ′ l = e iθ ′ j and e iθ ′ l e iθ ′ j , respectively. Our goal, just as in the case in which α mi = 0, is to show that for each m and j there is at least one independent complex variable that can be tuned. Here, however, we have a difficulty since although h m jm j is an independent variable, it must be real since H 2 is hermitian. Moreover, the other terms h m jml or h m jkl for {k, l} {m, j} cannot be considered as independent, since they can interfere in other components.\n\nOur way to solve these problems is to consider an induction process. First, we consider\n\nfor any m such that α mi 0 and any j and l. Moreover, consider that we order all indexes (because they are countable, we can always do this) and assume m(1) as the first index in which α m(1)i 0. Consider the first index j = 1, such that Eq. (  144 ) can be rewritten, considering Eq. (145), as:\n\nwhere N ′′ m(1) is the set of indexes {n} such that θ n = θ m(1) mod 2π. Now, let us consider the first k ′ such that θ k ′ N ′′ m(1) and α k ′ i 0. By the definition of U ′ and of Θ ′ as satisfying condition U, for all m(i), and k ′ , there exist infinitely many l such that\n\n, i.e. there are infinitely many l such that {k ′ , l} ∈ N m(1)1 . Let us define the smallest l such that {k ′ , l} ∈ N m(1)1\n\nas l(k ′ ). Moreover, from now on, let us denote, for any j, β j = z j e iγ j , where by the definition of β j , z j > 0 is the real modulus and γ j 0, π/2 mod 2π, is the argument. We then define the coefficients h m(1)1k ′ l , with {k ′ , l} ∈ N m(1)1 as follows:\n\nNotice that, by definition, it follows that\n\nBy defining h m(1)1k ′ l for {k ′ , l} ∈ N m(1)1 as in Eq. (147), we have that\n\nInserting this expression in Eq. (  146 ), we have that\n\nIn order words, we eliminated the first term k ′ of the first and second summation. Since the definition of h m(1)1k ′ l does not alters the definition of h m(1)1kl for other k m(1), then we can consider a similar definition for all the other k m(1) in Eq.(  152 ), as follows:\n\nwhere l(k) is the smallest index l in which {k, l} ∈ N m(1)1 . Using the definition in Eq. (  151 ) for all k m with α ki 0 in Eq.\n\n(152), we then obtain\n\nas we aimed. Now, let us consider the second smallest index m(  2 ) such that α m(2)i 0. We then have the component |u m(  2 ) , u 1 ⟩ of Eq. (  137 ), considering definition (145) can be written as\n\nThere are two possibilities:\n\n. In this case, from the definition (151), it follows that h m(1)1m(  2 )l = h * m(  2 )lm(  1 )1 = h m(  2 )lm(1)1 = 0 for any l. As a result, we can define as before, for any k m(2) such that α ki 0, the following:\n\nNotice that this condition does not contradicts the definition (154) for m(1), since in both cases we get h m(2)1m(  1 )\n\n). Considering this definition in Eq . (  153 ) we obtain again\n\nNow, let us consider the case in which θ m(2) θ m(1) so that m(2) N ′ m  (1)  . In this case, for any k m(1) and k m(2) we can define h m(2) jkl as in Eq. (  154 ) and insert them in Eq. (  153 ) to obtain\n\nwhere the summation {m(1),l}∈N m(2)1 is over all l such that {m(1), l} ∈ N m(2)1 for the fixed index m(1). Now, it cannot be the case that simultaneously m(2) N ′ m(1) and 1 is equal to the smallest l such that {m(2), l} ∈ N m(1)1 , since if m(2) N ′ m(1) and therefore θ m(1) θ m  (2)  , it cannot be the case that θ ′ 1 + θ m(1) = θ ′ 1 + θ m(2) and therefore {m(1), 1} N m(2)1 . Therefore, for any l, h m(2)1m(1)l = h * m(1)lm(2)1 was not defined in the previous definitions in Eq. (151) for m  (1) . Thus, we can define h m(2)1m(1)l as in Eq. (154) substituting k → m(1) to obtain, considering Eq. (156),\n\nThis procedure can be repeated for all m in which α mi 0 for the same index j = 1 using the same reasoning, so that defining for all m\n\nit follows that\n\nNow, let us consider again m(1) but now we consider the second smallest index j = 2. We need to consider now the fact that it is possible that some h m(1)2k1 = h * k1m(1)2 have already being defined in Eq. (  158 ). Let us define the set O 12m(1) as the set of indexes k such that h k1m(1)2 have already being defined in Eq. (  158 ).

We then propose the following definition for all k m(1),\n\nwhere l ′′ (k) is the smallest l such that {k, l} ∈ N m(1)2 with k ∈ O 12m(1) and l > 1. Notice that because there are infinitely many l such that {k, l} ∈ N m(1)2 , then we can always find such l ′′ (k). Inserting the definition Eq. (  164 ) in Eq. (  161 ) for all k m(1), k ∈ O 12m(1) , we obtain have already being defined in Eq.

Using this definition, it follows for any m that\n\nNow, we want to prove a rule of induction considering the procedure that we did until now for all other indexes. Specifically, we want to define the component h m(1) jkl of which α m(1)i 0 for any j, given that h m j ′ kl was already defined using the same procedure for all k, l, m and j ′ = j -1, j -2, • • • 1 and that for all such m and j\n\nLet us thus consider the indexes j and m  (1) . We define J( j, m(1), k) as the set of all indexes { j ′ } such that j ′ ≤ j and h m(1) jk j ′ = h k j ′ m(1) j was already defined in previous steps. Also, we define O( j, m(  1 )) of all the k indexes in which at least some j ′ < j, the term h m(1) jk j ′ was already defined. Considering these sets, we then introduce the following definitions\n\nthen we can consider the same definition l = l ′′ (k), and consider\n\nwhere {k, l} ∈ N m j , α ki 0, k N ′ m  (1)  . If l l ′′ (k), {k, l} ∈ N m(1) j , α ki 0, and k N ′ m  (1)  or in case that k ∈ N ′ m(1) then we define\n\nNotice that since for any k, j, and m(  1 ), there are infinitely many l such that {k, l} ∈ N m(1) j , then l ′′ (k) can always be defined.\n\nLet us consider the eigenvalue-eigenvector equation for the component |u m  (1)  , u ′ j ⟩, considering (145):\n\nNow, considering the fact that for all k ∈ O( j, m  (1) ) and for such k, all indexes j ′ ∈ J( j, m(1), k), h m(1) jk j ′ was already defined for some j ′ < j, then Eq. (  174 ) can be rewritten as\n\nwhere we consider the short notation:\n\nSubstituting the definitions in Eqs. (  171 )-(173) in the third and second sum of Eq. (  175 ), we can check that\n\nNow, notice that for any r > 1, it follows that either m(r) ∈ N ′ m  (1)  or m(r) N ′ m(1) . In the case in which m(r) ∈ N ′ m  (1)  , it follows that, in accordance with (173), h m(1) jm(r)l = h * m(r)lm(1) j = h m(r)lm(1) j = 0 for any l. We can thus consider the same definitions as in Eqs. (  171 )-(173) substituting m(1) → m(r) and this will not contradict the fact that h m(1) jm(r) j = h * m(r) jm(1) j = h m(r) jm(1) j = 0. As a result, it follows that using Eqs. (  171 )-(173), Eq. (179) will hold similarly substituting m(1) → m(r). On the other hand, if θ m(r) θ m(1) and m(r) N ′ m  (1)  , then it cannot be the case that simultaneously m(r) N ′ m(1) and j is equal to the smallest l such that {m(r), l} ∈ N m(1) j . Therefore, for any l > j -1, h m(r) jm(  1 )l = h * m(  1 )lm(r) j was not yet defined. Thus, we can define h m(r) jkl as in Eqs. (  171 )-(173) substituting m(1) → m(r) to obtain Eq. (  179 ) for any r. As a result, given that we assume for the induction process that Eq. (  170 ) holds for any m and j ′ = j-1, j-2, • • • , 1 and given the fact that for all r ≥ 1, Eq. (179) holds substituting m(1) → m(r), then it follows that for all m and all j ′ = j, j -1, j -2,\n\nTherefore, by assuming that Eq. (  170 ) holds for any m and all j ′ = j -1, j -2, • • • 1, we proved that it also holds for all m and all j ′ = j, j -1, j -2, • • • 1. Given that j is arbitrary here and that we proved Eqs. (  159 ) and (169) for j = 1 and j = 2, respectively, then Eq. (  170 ) holds for j = 1 and j = 2, and, by induction, it is valid for all j = 3, 4, 5, • • • . As a result, for any m such that α mi 0 and any j,\n\nConsidering this result and (143), we can thus conclude that for the only two possible scenarios, in which either α mi 0 or α mi = 0, we can always tune h m jkl that defines H 2 in Eq.

This dependence can thus be implicit in U and we take into account this fact in the notation of ∆(H 1 (0), H 1 (t), U). Now, we define in analogy to the time-independent case, a time-dependent measurement protocol M t  [6, 7]  to measure the variation of any time-dependent arbitrary operator H 1 (t) under an arbitrary evolution U; for the protocol M t and for each (H 1 (0), H 1 (t), U) triplet, the set M t (H 1 (0), H 1 (t), U) = {M(z, H 1 (0), H 1 (t), U)} defines a POVM whose operators satisfy the usual POVM properties, viz. ∞ -∞ dzM(z, H 1 (0), H 1 (t), U) = 1 and M(z, H 1 (0), H 1 (t), U) ≥ 0.

      "text": "As mentioned in the main text, in specific scenarios, result 2 can be used to obtain the OBS statistics via a probe, an auxiliary energy operator H 2 . However, as seen in the derivation of result 2, finding a physically intuitive operator H 2 and a state |v⟩ such that result 2 can be directly applied is not always straightforward. Nevertheless, there exist special cases where H 2 can be explicitly given without introducing an additional subspace (H ′ in result 2). We analyze such cases here.\n\nConsider a system Ω whose total energy is given by\n\nwhere both H 1 and H 2 act on the same Hilbert space H. The unitary evolution is specified as U = exp[-iHt/ℏ], and the following commutation relations hold: An illustrative example of this scenario is provided in Fig.  1 , corresponding to the trapped ion system analyzed in Figs.  1, 3 , and 4 of the main text. In this case, the unitary evolution is given by\n\nwhere the Hamiltonian takes the form\n\nwith\n\nBy making the substitutions\n\nwe recover result 2, demonstrating that measuring H 2 at times 0 and τ yields the same statistics for the variation of H 1 under U τ as obtained via the OBS protocol. This scenario represents a special case of result 2. On the left, the OBS protocol is applied to measure ∆(H 1 , U). The system's position X and spin σ z are measured, yielding x 0 and -1, respectively. This determines the variation of energy as δ x 0 (H 1 , U) = -2mω 2 ax 0 + 2mω 2 a 2 which is the eigenvalue of ∆(H 1 , U) associated with the eigenvector |δ x 0 (H 1 , U)⟩ = |x 0 , -⟩.\n\nOn the right, result 2 is applied to the same system, approximately prepared in the eigenstate |δ x 0 (H 1 , U)⟩. In this case, |δ x 0 (H 1 , U)⟩ is an eigenstate of both H 2 and U † H 2 U. Measurements of H 2 at t = 0 and U † H 2 U at t = τ, via measurements of X and σ z , yield the eigenvalues E x 0 = -ℏ(ω z /2 + ∆ S k SW x 0 /2) and E ′ x 0 = E x 0δ x 0 (H 1 , U), respectively. By the reality condition, the variation of H 2 is -δ x 0 (H 1 , U).
