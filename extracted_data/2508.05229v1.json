      "text": "Electroencephalogram (EEG) based multi-dimension emotion recognition has attracted substantial research interest in human computer interfaces. However, the high dimensionality of EEG features, coupled with limited sample sizes, frequently leads to classifier overfitting and high computational complexity. Feature selection constitutes a critical strategy for mitigating these challenges. Most existing EEG feature selection methods assume complete multi-dimensional emotion labels. In practice, open acquisition environment, and the inherent subjectivity of emotion perception often result in incomplete label data, which can compromise model generalization. Additionally, existing feature selection methods for handling incomplete multi-dimensional labels primarily focus on correlations among various dimensions during label recovery, neglecting the correlation between samples in the label space and their interaction with various dimensions. To address these issues, we propose a novel incomplete multi-dimensional feature selection algorithm for EEG-base emotion recognition. The proposed method integrates an adaptive dual self-expression learning (ADSEL) with least squares regression. ADSEL establishes a bidirectional pathway between sample-level and dimension-level self-expression learning processes within the label space. It could facilitate the cross-sharing of learned information between these processes, enabling the simultaneous exploitation of effective information across both samples and dimensions for label reconstruction. Consequently, ADSEL could enhances label recovery accuracy and effectively identifies the optimal EEG feature subset for multi-dimensional emotion recognition. We evaluated ADSEL against 14 state-ofthe-art feature selection algorithms on two widely recognized public EEG datasets with multi-dimensional emotional labels. Experimental results demonstrate that ADSEL could achieve superior performance under conditions of partial label absence.",

      "text": "Electroencephalogram (EEG) have proven particularly valuable in emotion recognition and brain computer interfaces research owing to its high temporal resolution, noninvasiveness, and relative simplicity of acquisition  (Wang, Zhang, and Di 2024) . To effectively characterize the nonstationary and nonlinear nature of EEG data associated with distinct affective states, researchers have employed diverse feature extraction methodologies. These include, but are not Figure  1 : While previous methods recover missing labels by solely considering correlations among dimensions in the multi-label space, our approach simultaneously integrates the inherent sample correlations, implicit inter-dimensional dependencies, and dynamic sample-dimension interactions during label recovery. limited to, Normalized Symmetry Index (NSI)  (Kroupi, Yazdani, and Ebrahimi 2011) , Shannon Entropy (SHE)  (Lin 1991) , and Higher-Order Crossing (HOC)  (Petrantonakis and Hadjileontiadis 2009) .\n\nAdvancements in EEG acquisition, particularly the adoption of high-density electrode arrays, have significantly increased EEG feature dimensionality  (Becker et al. 2017; Wang, Wu, and Yao 2022) . However, EEG-based emotion recognition applications often face limited sample sizes, increasing susceptibility to the curse of dimensionality. For emotion recognition models, it will elevate risks of model overfitting/underfitting and substantial computational costs  (Wang et al. 2020) . Feature selection is pivotal to address these challenges and could enhance the performance, generalizability, and interpretability of the emotion recognition models  (Jenke, Peer, and Buss 2014) . It is adopted to elim-inate redundancy and noise while preserving informative neural representations for emotion recognition.\n\nEEG feature selection methods are broadly categorized into three paradigms: filter, wrapper, and embedded methods  (Hou et al. 2011) . Filter methods assess feature relevance using statistical or information-theoretic criteria, but often yield suboptimal subsets irrespective of the performance of classifiers  (Zhang et al. 2019b) . Wrapper methods evaluate subsets based directly on classifier accuracies, typically achieving superior results  (Hou et al. 2011 ). However, their exhaustive search can be computationally intensive  (Zhang et al. 2019b ). Currently, to address this issues of filter and wrapper methods, embedded methods integrating feature selection within the model training process itself have been employed. Empirical studies  (Xu et al. 2020 (Xu et al. , 2023;; Abdumalikov, Kim, and Yoon 2024; Hu, Tan, and Tian 2025)  demonstrate their efficacy for emotion recognition.\n\nMost feature selection methods for EEG-based emotion recognition universally presume the availability of fully annotated and reliable training labels. However, in practical deployment scenarios, label absence constitutes a prevalent and often unavoidable challenge, stemming from open acquisition environments and inherent inconsistencies in subjective emotional annotation. The missing-label condition significantly degrades the performance of existing EEG emotional feature selection techniques, consequently impairing emotion recognition accuracies.\n\nAdditionally, contemporary feature selection methods for handling incomplete multi-dimensional labels primarily focus on modeling inter-dimensional correlations within the label space to facilitate label recovery  (Xu et al. 2024) . However, these methods overlook the inherent relationships between samples and dynamic interactions between samples and dimensions in the label space when restoring labels. By failing to adequately account for these multifaceted structural dependencies, state-of-the-art methods suffer from inherent limitations in the accuracies and robustness of label restoration. Consequently, such neglect leads to suboptimal feature selection.\n\nTo address the challenges, a novel Adaptive Dual Self-Expression Learning (ADSEL) model is proposed for EEG emotional feature selection. This framework is specifically designed to identify highly discriminative EEG feature subsets under incomplete multi-dimensional emotional label conditions. ADSEL could reconstruct a robust multidimensional label by synergistically integrating information from both the samples and dimensions in the label space. This enables the selection of EEG features exhibiting strong discriminative capabilities with minimal redundancy.\n\nFurthermore, the main contributions of the article are as follows:\n\n• We propose a novel incomplete multi-dimensional feature selection algorithm for EEG-base emotion recognition. The proposed method integrates an adaptive dual self-expression learning (ADSEL) with least squares regression. ADSEL establishes a bidirectional pathway between sample-level and dimension-level self-expression learning processes within the label space. It could facil-itate the cross-sharing of learned information between these processes, enabling the simultaneous exploitation of effective information across both samples and dimensions for label reconstruction. • To tackle the optimization difficulties of ADSEL, an efficient alternative optimization approach is proposed. The strategy guarantees algorithmic convergence and ensures the attainment of a globally optimal solution.\n\nThe EEG feature matrix X ∈ R d×n contains d features, where row vector x i ∈ R 1×n (i = 1, ..., d) spans n samples. Emotional states are encoded in the label matrix Y ∈ {0, 1}\n\nn×k , representing k affective dimensions across n instances. Parameters d, n, and k denote feature count, sample size, and emotion dimensions, respectively. The allone vector 1 n = (1, 1 . . . , 1) T ∈ R n×1 and identity matrix I n ∈ R n×n are standard matrix.",

      "text": "Owing to diverse search strategies, feature selection methodologies are commonly classified into three primary categories: filter methods, wrapper methods, and embedded methods  (Zhang et al. 2019b) .\n\nFilter methods evaluate features based on intrinsic statistical properties, such as correlation coefficients or information-theoretic measures, ranking features independently of the learning model  (Saeys, Inza, and Larrañaga 2007) . Representative algorithms include ReliefF  (Zhang et al. 2016 ) and information gain  (Chen et al. 2015) . However, they may overlook features whose discriminative power emerges only in combination.\n\nWrapper methods adopt classifier performance to evaluate feature subsets, employing search strategies like evolutionary computation  (Nakisa et al. 2018)  to explore combinations. Their main drawback is high computational cost due to iterative model training  (Tang, Alelyani, and Liu 2014) .\n\nEmbedded methods integrate feature selection directly into model training, simultaneously optimizing model parameters and feature importance  (Li et al. 2019) . Least squares regression (LSR) is a widely adopted foundation  (Nie et al. 2010; Chen et al. 2018; Wu et al. 2021; Xu et al. 2023 Xu et al. , 2024)) .

Huang et al.  proposed Learning Label-Specific Features for Missing Labels  (Huang et al. 2019 ) leverages higher-order label correlation to build a complementary matrix and learn label-specific features, yet is sensitive to initial missing rates. Yin et al. proposed Feature Selection for Multilabel classification with Missing labels (FSMML)  (Yin et al. 2024 ) employs a multi-scale fuzzy roughness framework, mapping data to multi-scale space. It balances feature correlation/redundancy via label distribution reconstruction and fuzzy uncertainty fusion to correct label bias, but incurs high complexity and weak interpretability.

Experimental results demonstrate the superior performance of ADSEL over 14 state-of-the-art methods.
