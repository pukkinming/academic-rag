      "text": "In the context of rapid advancements in artificial intelligence, technologies such as computer vision and natural language processing are being applied to a myriad of tasks to promote human wellbeing  [8, 12, 26, 36] . These technologies hold particular significance in providing emerging interaction methods within the field of human-computer interaction  [59] . They rely heavily on machine learning methods, where data annotation serves as a fundamental and indispensable step in model development  [73] .\n\nIn the development of machine learning models, data annotation serves as a foundational and indispensable step  [58, 59] . Accurate annotations are crucial for training machine learning models that can effectively interpret complex data, particularly in tasks involving human emotions and behaviors. However, the annotation process is notoriously labor-intensive and costly  [73] , requiring annotators to spend prolonged periods meticulously labeling data  [69] . This manual effort not only demands significant human resources but also introduces variability and potential biases inherent in human cognition  [13, 15] . The challenge is magnified for emotion annotation tasks, where the subjective and nuanced nature of emotions complicates the labeling process. Addressing these challenges requires annotators to repeatedly review the data and engage in multiple rounds of iteration and discussion  [17, 41, 66] .\n\nTo address these challenges, various annotation methodologies have been proposed, including the utilization of crowdsourcing platforms. Crowdsourcing can accelerate the annotation process by distributing the workload across a large number of annotators, thereby reducing both time and cost  [55] . Despite these advantages, crowdsourcing methods often prove insufficient when dealing with specialized environments or tasks that require nuanced understanding and expert judgment  [56] . In such contexts, the reliance on human labor and expertise remains indispensable, highlighting the persistent need for more efficient and scalable annotation solutions.\n\nRecent advancements in artificial intelligence (AI), particularly in the realm of large multimodal models (LMMs), have opened new avenues for automating annotation tasks  [48, 64] . LMMs, such as Generative Pre-trained Transformer (GPT), possess sophisticated natural language understanding capabilities and operate effectively in zero-shot settings, where they can perform tasks without explicit prior training on specific datasets  [49] . These models have demonstrated potential in various applications, from text generation to semantic understanding, suggesting their utility in assisting or even replacing human annotators  [2, 51, 67] .\n\nFurthermore, the latest iterations of LMMs integrate visual capabilities, enabling them to comprehend and interpret graphical information in conjunction with textual data  [42, 71] . This multimodal proficiency suggests that LMMs could become valuable tools for tasks that encompass both visual and linguistic components  [4, 21, 31] . By leveraging their ability to understand visual inputs and operate in zero-shot settings, LMMs have the potential to streamline the annotation process while maintaining both accuracy and efficiency  [22] . However, aside from capacity and performance considerations, the cost of computing resources is also very important. This matter is especially critical for individual users, students, small teams, and start-ups. Currently, because of the understandable business considerations, these groups rarely or even impossible to participate in the pricing process for computing resources such as API access and hardwares like graphic cards. Although we appreciate the discounts and grants offered to these groups, which show support from businesses and policies, these discounts do not reduce the overall use of computing resources. This means that their workflows and project goals remain limited by budget issues. In particular, some tasks or applications that depend heavily on computing resources may still not be easy to process.\n\nBuilding on these capabilities and considering ways to reduce input and output costs, our study investigates the feasibility and performance of using LMMs for the automatic annotation of human emotions in everyday scenarios. Specifically, we employ the GPT-4o-mini model to conduct rapid, zero-shot labeling of key frames extracted from video segments within the DailyLife subset of the publicly available FERV39k dataset  [57] . Our experiments assess the model's performance across two emotion taxonomies: a sevenclass taxonomy encompassing \"Angry, \" \"Disgust, \" \"Fear, \" \"Happy, \" \"Neutral, \" \"Sad, \" and \"Surprise, \" and a ternary taxonomy categorizing emotions as negative, neutral, or positive.\n\nOur results indicate that the LMM attained an average precision of approximately 50% in the seven-class taxonomy, surpassing a simple baseline. This underscores the model's ability to discern complex emotional states without task-specific training. Notably, when the classification was constrained to a simpler ternary classification, the average precision increased to around 64%, demonstrating the model's enhanced performance in broader emotion categories. Additionally, we investigated strategies of integrating multiple frames within 1-2 second video clips to improve labeling performance and reduce annotation costs. This approach resulted a slight but notable improvement in accuracy.\n\nOur findings contribute to the growing body of research aimed at enhancing data annotation methods through AI. By examining the capabilities and limitations of zero-shot LMMs in emotion annotation tasks, we also discuss the potential for employing LMMs in practical applications to reduce costs and enhance scalability in real-world applications.",

      "text": "Annotating human emotions has consistently been a challenging task  [37] , not only due to the inherent complexity of emotions  [19]  but also because annotators may have varying evaluation standards (or subjectivity)  [6, 47] . A significant issue in emotion annotation is the annotation method. Although the most reliable annotation standard requires individuals to perform the annotations themselves, real-time self-annotation can lead to distraction and affect the expression of emotions  [14] . On the other hand, retrospective annotation relies on individuals' recollections  [7, 17] , which may lead to bias  [20]  as well as high cost  [23] , and can cause embarrassment  [1] . Another widely used annotation method involves external annotators observing and labeling human emotions  [25] . By leveraging human cognition and understanding, and considering the context, external annotators provide reliable emotional labels based on various cues  [54] . Although these two annotation methods can be combined  [66] , they may not be suitable for largescale data processing. Regardless, emotion annotation remains a labor-intensive task. Therefore, exploring more efficient emotion annotation methods is crucial.\n\nCurrently, many annotation methods involve semi-automated or automated labeling conducted by models  [14, 24, 40, 43, 45, 46, 70] , which greatly improves annotation efficiency. However, such annotations are typically built upon prior preparations, meaning that before the annotation task begins, data with emotion annotations are still required to train the underlying annotation models  [62] . Furthermore, in some specific tasks, these labels cannot be easily shared due to task constraints, but instead require the preparation of pre-trained data that suits specific scenarios  [35] . This implies that the traditional challenges in annotation tasks still persist.\n\nAnother important issue in emotion annotation is the choice of emotion classification scheme. Considering that annotation is a time-consuming and laborious process, researchers often categorize emotions based on task requirements to reduce the difficulty of annotation and improve efficiency. Examples include categorizing emotions into positive and negative  [28] , emotional and neutral states  [3] , classifying specific emotions by their intensities  [66] , and using basic emotions  [33, 65] . In this study, we consider the potential task requirements of these various classification standards and base our research based on the available ground truth emotion labels.",

An increasing number of researchers and practitioners have recognized the vast potential of LLMs and LMMs for enhancing annotation processes  [32] . As researchers continue to explore and leverage the advancing capabilities of LLMs, particularly in multimodal interactions  [63]  and improvements in processing power  [5] , the range of annotation tasks has expanded significantly. These tasks now encompass various data types, including text  [30] , audio  [16] , images  [11, 39] , and specialized domain-specific data  [50, 68] .\n\nA recent survey has shed light on current trends and leading research in the application of LMMs for annotation tasks  [49] . Within the scope of our study, which focuses on emotion annotation for image data, related work has explored various capabilities of LMMs. For instance, researchers have evaluated the ability of LMMs to predict emotions from captions generated from images-derived captions  [60] , perform image retrieval  [61] , and generate descriptive captions  [44] . Notably, in early 2024, a study compared the performance of LMMs such as GPT-3.5, GPT-4, and Bard against traditional supervised models like Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) for emotion recognition in image data  [34] . The findings revealed that deep learning models specifically trained for this task generally achieved higher accuracy than LMMs.\n\nHowever, despite the superior accuracy of traditional supervised models, they also present significant limitations. Nonetheless, LMMs offer the potential to achieve performance that is comparable to traditional models while reducing training and application costs. Therefore, in this study, we further optimized prompt engineering and reorganized annotation strategies to harness the capabilities and advantages of LMMs.",

This sampling reduced annotation counts while capturing key emotional transitions. Different weighting strategies were then applied to derive comprehensive labels for each segment based on these frames.

Initially, a prompt was set to establish the model as a \"professional image emotion analysis assistant,\" explicitly listing the available emotion options derived from the predefined 𝐸𝑀𝑂𝑇 𝐼𝑂𝑁 _𝐿𝐴𝐵𝐸𝐿𝑆. This foundational setup ensures that the model operates within the desired context and understands the classification framework. For each image (or multi-frame integrated image) to be analyzed, we constructed a user message that includes both textual instructions and the image itself, e.g., \"This is an independent image frame, please analyze the emotion. Please analyze the emotion of the following image and select the most matching one from the above options, returning only the emotion name.\"\n\nSubsequently, the user message was structured to include both textual and visual inputs. The textual component began with a customized prompt instructing the model to analyze the emotion conveyed in the image and select the most appropriate emotion from the provided options. This was followed by embedding the image itself, encoded in base64 format, within the message. By integrating the image (linked to local address) in this manner, we facilitated a multimodal interaction, allowing the model to process and interpret visual data alongside textual instructions.\n\nThe model was further directed to return only the name of the identified emotion, ensuring concise and relevant output. After the model generated a response, the content was extracted and stripped of any extraneous whitespace to obtain a clean final emotion label.

The model exhibited robust precision for the \"Happy\" category (0.84) but encountered significant challenges in accurately classifying \"Disgust\" (precision: 0.04). The recall metric was notably high for \"Sad\" (0.65) and considerably low for \"Disgust\" (0.18), highlighting the model's difficulty in reliably identifying certain emotional states.\n\nStrategy B1 (Majority Voting) yielded an incremental improvement in accuracy, reaching 41%. Precision for \"Happy rose to 0.89, while \"Disgust\" experienced marginal enhancements in both precision (0.07) and recall (0.23). This suggests that aggregating frame-level annotations through majority voting can slightly bolster performance for specific emotions.\n\nStrategy C1 (Majority Voting Excluding \"Neutral\") further augmented the accuracy to 46%. By excluding the \"Neutral\" category from the majority voting process, this approach improved recall for \"Sad\" to 0.76 and maintained high precision for \"Happy\" (0.85). This indicates that focusing on \"Negative\" and \"Positive\" emotions can mitigate some inaccuracies associated with the \"Neutral\" classifications, thereby enhancing overall annotation reliability.\n\nStrategy D1 (Multi-Frame Integration) achieved an accuracy of 46%, paralleling Strategy C1. By amalgamating multiple frames into a single input, this strategy effectively harnessed temporal context, thereby improving the model's capacity to capture the dynamic progression of emotions across video segments. This integration allows the model to consider the emotional transitions and consistencies present within the selected frames, leading to more coherent and accurate segment-level annotations.\n\nAdditionally, when considering the macro average and weighted average metrics, Strategies C1 and D1 not only achieved higher accuracy but also demonstrated improved balanced performance across all classes. The macro average indicates that these strategies perform more consistently across less frequent emotion categories, while the weighted average reflects their enhanced overall performance, accounting for class imbalances in the dataset.\n\nTo further validate these observations, a non-parametric Friedman test was conducted on the merged dataset (comprising the results from Strategies B1, C1, and D1). As shown in Table  2 , the Friedman test revealed a statistically significant difference among these strategies (p<0.05).

The results indicate that there is no statistically significant difference between Strategies B1 and C1. In contrast, Strategy D1 is statistically significantly different from both B1 and C1 (p<0.05).

The performance metrics reported are WAR (Weighted Average Recall)  4  and UAR (Unweighted/Macro Average Recall)  5  , which provide a balanced evaluation by accounting for class imbalances and ensuring that each class contributes proportionally to the overall performance.\n\nIn the DailyLife category, baseline models achieved the following WAR/UAR scores as shown in Table  7 .\n\nOur best-performing strategy within the seven-class taxonomy, Strategy D1 (Multi-Frame Integration), achieved a WAR of 46%, which closely rivals top-performing pre-trained baseline methods such as AEN  (   𝛾 The result of zero-shot method with label augmentation Table  7 : Comparison of Weighted Average Recall (WAR) and Unweighted Average Recall (UAR) between baseline architectures (trained from scratch) and the LMM-based zero-shot method (GPT-4o-mini) on the FERV39k DailyLife subset  [57] . methods, aiming to further save computational resources while still improving recognition results.",

      "text": "Besides performing close to or outperforming baseline models in performance, compared to traditional supervised models, GPT-4omini-based annotation strategies have significant advantages in cost-effectiveness and scalability. Strategy D1 reduces operational costs by minimizing the number of API requests and decreasing token lengths through preprocessing. This cost-effective approach ensures that large-scale annotation tasks remain financially feasible. Furthermore, our zero-shot annotation approach leverages the capabilities of LMMs without necessitating task-specific training, allowing for rapid deployment and adaptation to various annotation tasks with minimal additional resources.\n\nWhile some baseline models, such as Two VGG13-LSTM, exhibit marginally higher WAR scores, our annotation strategy D1 achieves comparable performance levels with enhanced cost and operational efficiencies. This underscores the effectiveness of aggregation techniques and temporal context integration in zero-shot annotation tasks using LMMs, presenting a viable alternative to traditional supervised models, especially in scenarios constrained by budget and computational resources.",

      "text": "This study demonstrates the feasibility of using LMMs for automated emotion annotation in facial images through zero-shot classification. By exploring various annotation strategies, we identified the potential of LMMs to achieve competitive performance, particularly in tasks involving ternary classification of emotions. Strategies that integrate multiple frames or aggregate annotations through majority voting significantly enhance the reliability of emotion recognition, offering a promising alternative to traditional supervised methods.\n\nWhile LMMs exhibit inherent ambiguity in distinguishing closely related emotion categories, particularly within the seven-class taxonomy, they achieve higher accuracy in simpler classification tasks. This highlights their utility in scenarios where efficiency and scalability are prioritized over fine-grained classification precision. Moreover, the cost-effective nature of zero-shot LMM annotation enables large-scale deployment, reducing the reliance on human annotators and minimizing operational costs.\n\nOur findings underscore the importance of leveraging aggregation techniques, temporal context, and task simplification to maximize the potential of LMMs in emotion annotation. Future work should focus on fine-tuning multimodal LMMs for emotion recognition, addressing ambiguities in classification, and expanding their application in real-world multimodal environments, such as driver attention detection, live streaming platform moderation, and health management systems. This research provides a foundation for advancing automated annotation techniques, fostering innovation in human-computer interaction and affective computing domains.",

It is also important to note that LLMs may hallucinate in the label space, potentially introducing inaccurate or spurious outputs that could mislead downstream processes. In this paper, our tests were carried out by calling the API, and under the privacy policy, none of these data will be shared or used for training purposes. In our study, the testing was carried out via API calls; under the privacy policy, this data will neither be shared nor used for training purposes. We also recommend experimenting with on-premise models in the future to eliminate the risk of data leaks. Beyond that, when prototyping responsibly around this capability, it may be wise to target specific tasks and scenarios first rather than rolling it out directly to a wider market.",
