      "text": "In this paper, at first, the impact of ImageNet pre-training on fine-grained Facial Emotion Recognition (FER) is investigated which shows that when enough augmentations on images are applied, training from scratch provides better result than fine-tuning on ImageNet pre-training. Next, we propose a method to improve fine-grained and in-the-wild FER, called Hybrid Multi-Task Learning (HMTL). HMTL uses Self-Supervised Learning (SSL) as an auxiliary task during classical Supervised Learning (SL) in the form of Multi-Task Learning (MTL). Leveraging SSL during training can gain additional information from images for the primary fine-grained SL task. We investigate how proposed HMTL can be used in the FER domain by designing two customized version of common pre-text task techniques, puzzling and in-painting. We achieve stateof-the-art results on the AffectNet benchmark via two types of HMTL, without utilizing pre-training on additional data. Experimental results on the common SSL pre-training and proposed HMTL demonstrate the difference and superiority of our work. However, HMTL is not only limited to FER domain. Experiments on two types of fine-grained facial tasks, i.e., head pose estimation and gender recognition, reveals the potential of using HMTL to improve finegrained facial representation.",

      "text": "Facial emotions are important factors in human communication to help people convey their emotional states and intentions. One-third of these communications are verbal components and two-third of residues are nonverbal. Among the non-verbal components, facial emotions have a key role in communications between people  [1] .\n\nRecently, various systems have been developed for recognizing facial emotions in the field of computer vision and deep learning  [1] . To detect emotion of a person in an image, a lot of visual information can be found such as appearance, gesture, behavior, and context of the scene. But facial emotions are dramatically the most important visual cue for analyzing basic human emotions  [2] .\n\nThere are two models to explain facial emotions in computer vision: categorical and circumplex (dimensional)  [3] :\n\nIn categorical model, Ekman  [4]  has defined a list of affective-related categories (Anger, Happy, Sad, Surprise, Disgust, Neutral, Fear, and Contempt), which emotions have been chosen from this list. The facial action coding system (FACS) depends on action units (AUs) or a set of facial muscle movements being determined to display the emotions of participants. Ekman used FACS to recognize emotions.\n\nThe circumplex model of emotion was developed by James Russell  [3] . This model suggests that emotions are distributed in a two-dimensional circular space, containing arousal and valence dimensions. To be precise, the vertical and the horizontal axis determine valence and arousal respectively and the center of this circle represents the normal state of valence and arousal  [5] . This model is shown in figure  1 .\n\nAccording to Russel and Ekman model, Data labeling requires experts and it is not as simple as annotating like the other computer vision tasks such as object detection. The inherent uncertainty in facial emotion recognition is the reason for the difficulty and the cost of labeling. This uncertainty is even more for the Russell's model. Thus, unlike other computer vision issues, collecting large amounts of labeled data in the field of Facial Emotion Recognition (FER) is challenging and may adversely impact on quality of annotating. This makes the utilize of deep learning or specifically Supervised Learning (SL), become less effective in FER. Recently, with progress in Self-Supervised Learning (SSL), results show that in an end-to-end learning manner, SSL methods can help us to overcome needing lots of labels  [6] [7] [8] . While recent contrastive SSL methods have demonstrated capability of them, they still have some drawbacks which did not solve completely, such as requiring large batch sizes to train  [6] , need for accessing huge amount of computation power and data to work well  [6, 7, 9] , and placing far behind of SL methods on fine-grained visual tasks  [10] . The last two ones are considered as the main hurdle to improve FER performance by SSL. In fact, as far as we know, there is no work which seriously attempt to use SSL on fine-grained FER. Furthermore, FER is one of the most challenging fine-grained problems because of its uncertainty. For example, in collecting and labeling AffectNet dataset, their collectors found that even with human training, there were about 60% to 70% agreement in their labeling among different emotions  [11] . In other words, it shows the uncertainty and ambiguity of emotion information through visual channel.\n\nIn some studies  [12, 13] , by the another type of SSL methods named pre-text task SSL, they could extract valuable features for many downstream tasks, even by doing pre-training on one image  [14] . In fact, in this type of pre-training, middle layers show better features concerning final layers. Likewise, by moving from low level layer to high level layer, increase and then decrease could be seen via linear evaluation of feature map  [14] . Since 1990s, different studies have shown the ability of Multi-Task Learning (MTL) in Supervised settings  [15, 16] . Yet, it is not quite obvious how to pick the proper tasks due to the fact that, before a certain point, two tasks enhance shareable features for each other and after that point, they start hurting each other which is described as cooperation and competition between tasks  [15] . Therefore, from another view, using SSL tasks can be looked through the MTL lens. So, why do not we use SL with auxiliary tasks of SSL concurrently in the MTL setting?\n\nIn this study, we used SSL besides SL in the MTL setting called Hybrid Multi-Task Learning (HMTL). The proposed HMTL was considered during the training procedures. It means that the SSL tasks were placed on top of the backbone and they could be removed from it during testing or inference. The purpose of appending SSL tasks was to help the backbone to build better features for the fine-grained FER. One important thing in the proposed HMTL was that it basically is not a pre-training technique like other studies in this major. Mainly, there are two ways to use SSL:  (1)  Using it to pre-train the weights, (2) leveraging SSL as an auxiliary task besides of SL which we showed the advantage of the second one. Need to mention that in this study, \"HMTL\", \"SL+SSL\" and \"SL with auxiliary SSL task\" are used interchangeably and refer to a same thing.\n\nThe contributions of this work are summarized as follows:\n\n1. We showed the effect of augmentation intensity on FER using pre-trained ImageNet weights and random weights. It showed that the combination of random weights and strong augmentation is superior to the fine-tuning on ImageNet weights procedure with any sorts of augmentation. 2. We did pre-training with some SSLs pre-text tasks. Results showed that two of our proposed SSL methods can extract better and useful features for the FER problem. They both were also good to use as the pre-training step. 3. We proposed a hypothesis which says: \"leveraging proper auxiliary tasks of SSL alongside with SL in MTL manner can improve performance of the downstream supervised task\". 4. Results showed that by utilizing our HMTL approach on AffectNet dataset, the performance of both types of emotion recognition (i.e., dimensional and categorical) on all the augment levels remarkably increased, even when 20% of the heavily imbalanced training set was used. 5. The impact of using auxiliary SSL tasks on two fine-grained head pose estimation and gender recognition were scrutinized which concluded to substantial average error reduction in head pose estimation.",

      "text": "Methods of emotion recognition from faces can be divided into two general categories: conventional methods and end-to-end learning methods, in which end-to-end based models have been able to achieve better performance in many computer vision problems  [1] .\n\nIn both approaches deep learning has been a crucial part. And also, among several deep learning models, convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have played important roles in FER for many years  [1] . CNNs completely reduce preprocessing techniques by providing end-to-end learning from inputs  [17] .\n\nEven though, some studies did not go only for CNN features. For example, in  [18] , they combined two types of feature extraction modes. First, they used features learned by CNN models through pre-trainings. Second, they used handcrafted features subtracted by a bag of visual words.\n\nBut, as we said, end-to-end learning methods have been superior than traditional methods. End-to-end methods mostly focused on designing different deep architecture  [19] [20] [21] . In a work  [19] , they used manifold networks in connection with CNN and showed that manifold networks of covariance pooling could get better performance than CNN networks with Softmax layers. Another work  [20] , introduced two CNN-based models for FER using different kernel sizes and numbers of filters.\n\nVideos can also be used to recognize emotions from faces as well  [22] . In videos, frames are classified to various emotions such as happy, sad, etc. Although Inception and ResNet networks have had significant results in the field of FER, these two architectures did not use temporal aggregation. To solve this problem, a three-dimensional (3D) Inception-ResNet architecture was introduced  [23] . In this type of architecture, geometric and temporal features were extracted in a sequence of frames with the three-dimensional model.\n\nAnother study  [24] , used two different types of CNN networks on videos that improve the FER performance. First model extracted the temporal characteristics features of the images and the second one extracted the temporal geometric characteristics of the Facial Landmarks (FLs) points over time.\n\nIn addition to CNN, combining CNNs with RNN based models (GRU, LSTM) also could improve the performance of the networks on videos. In a study  [25] , three architectures that consist of a combination of CNN and RNN to recognize dimensional emotions in a MTL manner were used. To join CNN and RNN, each video frame was given to the CNN model, then several levels of features were extracted from it to feed each of them to multi RNNs. Combining end-toend approaches like LSTMs with CNNs and supporting the variable-length inputs and outputs are the most important advantages of using LSTM  [1] . In a study  [26] , a hybrid model in the form of LSTM-CNN was proposed which showed that this hybrid architecture could outperform previous 3D-CNN over time.\n\nJust like CNNs, using attentional models have achieved significant improvements over other methods in recent years  [27] [28] [29] [30] . A study  [27] , used CNN with visual attention for feature extraction and detection of important regions. Another study  [31] , proposed a CNN with attention mechanisms that could understand occlusion regions in the face. Also, they created an end-toend trainable Patch-Gated CNNs to recognize facial expressions from occluded faces, and the model could automatically focus on unoccluded regions.\n\nHowever, there have been a few methods which have done novel experiment such as using graph convolutional neural networks  [32] . In fact, undirected graphs were constructed from faces. Likewise, another study  [33]  used an identity-free conditional Generative Adversarial Network (IF-GAN) to detect facial expressions by distinguishing two types of features in faces: Information related to personal identity and information related to facial expressions. This work tried to reduce the effect of identity features in facial images as much as possible, and then the features related to facial expressions were used to categorize emotions.",

      "text": "SSL methods are used to learn features from unlabeled data without using annotated labels. This method of learning is used as a subset of unsupervised learning methods to avoid the large cost of gathering and labeling huge scales of datasets. SL methods need data pairs of (x, y) as the input and output which usually are annotated by a human. SSL methods are also learned from the input x, but unlike SL, the labels y are automatically generated from the inputs, without participating in any human annotation  [34] . In the variety of scales including the robustness of adversarial examples, label corruption, Semi-Supervised learning, etc. SSL methods are useful.\n\nMany SSL methods have been proposed in the computer vision field  [34]  which in general, three types of approaches exist:\n\n1. Contrastive learning 2. Non-contrastive learning 3. Pre-text task learning\n\nIn the mid-2010s, pre-text task learning, including colorization, in-painting, and self-supervised jigsaw puzzle became popular in computer vision field  [35, 36] . However, recently, contrastive and non-contrastive SSL methods have achieved better results on challenging datasets such as ImageNet  [6, 8, 9] . Although these methods have been successful to achieve better results, they need more data and more computation cost to work well. Also, the training process of them are rather hard and tricky. However, these methods could not work well on finegrain problems such as FER which shows that there is a room for improvement  [10] .\n\nOne of the most well-known pre-text task techniques is random rotation. In  [12] , they used 2d image rotation, which was applied to input images to learn direction with CNN training. In addition to random rotation self-supervision, several papers used jigsaw puzzles in a SSL manner. For instance,  [37, 38]  used a jigsaw puzzle that shredded each image, then shuffled it and fed it to a Siamese network. Also,  [13]  used SSL to solve jigsaw puzzles, in-painting, and colorization together.",

If the imbalance is high, it can affect the performance of the classifier and cause the network to bias towards the larger class  [39] . Therefore, there are several ways to deal with this problem:\n\n1. Up sampling 2. Down sampling 3. Customize loss function It has been shown that the customized loss function performs better in FER  [11] . In this work, we consider weighted loss and focal loss as two popular ones.\n\nIn weighted loss method, a higher loss is assigned to the samples belonging to the classes with fewer samples. Focal loss  [40]  reduces the effect of error calculation when the probability of predicting output p increased with adjustable alpha and gamma coefficients. If the network has more confidence in predicting samples the loss function will get lower and smaller coefficients and consequently, difficult samples will get bigger coefficients.",

      "text": "In this section, three SSL methods are selected: Rotating, Puzzling and Inpainting.\n\nIn rotation method, images multiply at N×45 degrees which N is chosen randomly from zero to seven. It means images rotate at one of eight directions and this direction is considered as the output label. Therefore, this is a classification problem with eight categories.\n\nOur customized proposed puzzling pre-text task is somehow different from the original jigsaw puzzling method. Unlike general jigsaw puzzling which different parts of the images are fed to a Siamese network separately, in our method (figure  3 ) at first, an image is sliced to N identical size square regions, where N must have a second root (4, 9, etc.). Then, all pieces are randomly shuffled and for each region, a label is created to show the original location of it. In the end, regions are merge into a single image and a neural network tries to learn the correct location of each region in the image. For this purpose, we need to create classification heads according to the number of regions. For example, as we illustrate in figure  3 , the image is divided into four regions which get shuffled and then, they merge into a single image. The neural network (EfficientNet) gets the puzzled images and tries to find the correct location of each region based on its head.\n\nIn contrast to previous methods, in-painting is not a classification problem. In this study, we consider two types of in-painting. The first one has one stage and the second one has two stages. The first one is a common SSL pre-text task which has been used a lot. We use it for both pre-training and HMTL that only has Pixel Wise Loss (PWL) function like mean square error (MSE). This is different from the two-stage type. We consider two-stage type due to the fact that we want to add a FER perceptual loss (PL) to it. The PL uses features of a pre-trained model which is trained on the same dataset in an ordinary supervised manner. In other words, PL function tries to reconstruct the missing part of an image with respect to the representation of a supervised model we already trained (figure  4 ). In this type of in-painting, we only use the PL which is defined as one of the HMTL methods.\n\nFor the erasing procedure of in-painting, we determine a fixed region in the image consisting of face attributes (figure  4 .a). Then, we cut a square with fix side randomly inside of the region (figure 4.b). In other words, the input images are cut out partially. Then, a SSH is built in the form of a deconvolutional decoder. The decoder tries to reconstruct the original image. Here the difference of two methods is shown up. The first one uses MSE loss function to fill the cutout image with respect to the original image, but, in the second type of inpainting (e.g., PL), at first, a pre-trained EfficientNet model as an offline teacher is considered to create representation for the loss function. Then, the SSH's output is trained only by representation of the offline teacher (figure  6 ).\n\nIn HMTL, the decoder head tries to close the distances of representation for generated image with the original one (the input image w/o cutout). Equation  3 shows the total loss function. The important point is that the FER model for creating representation is trained with SL only on AffectNet under the same augmentation setting (w/o cutout). Therefore, this means no additional information from different augmenting levels or different datasets are going through the error signal.",

      "text": "The impact of multitask learning in neural networks is palpable  [16] . As we look furthermore into this issue, there are a lot of information in images that can increase the performance of deep networks in computer vision indirectly. This information cannot correctly be recognized in SL because of their indirect effects on the loss function. For example, simultaneously recognition of facial features along with emotion could improve the final performance of emotion recognition  [42][43] . We believe that these features are not clear enough to be accessible from emotion labels. With consideration that gathering and annotating multi labels in FER (e.g., AU, landmark, etc.) are expensive and hard to access with hand labeling, we propose a hypothesis that says: \"leveraging proper tasks of SSL as auxiliary tasks beside the SL in the MTL setting can improve supervised task representation\". This statement means that if SSHs are put alongside SH, it helps the networks to create a better representation of images for the task. To choose the best HMTL approach, each method of self-supervision can be separately performed and the effectiveness of extracted features on solving the main problem can be examined as well. A SSL method that find valuable features for a downstream task (here FER), can be used besides of SL head (figure  5, 6 ).\n\nWhere:\n\n• 𝐿 𝑆𝐿 : weighted categorical cross entropy for supervised head • 𝐿 𝑆𝑆𝐿 : categorical cross entropy for puzzling self-supervised heads\n\nWhere:\n\n• 𝐿 𝑆𝐿 : weighted categorical cross entropy for supervised head • 𝐿 𝑆𝑆𝐿 : categorical cross entropy for puzzling self-supervised heads and rotation selfsupervised head\n\nWhere:",

In contrast, the consequence of that on the random weights mode has been more recognizable.

In the second approach, only one head has been placed on top of the backbone which the number of classes has been equal to the number of rotation directions. In the third one, all heads of the first and second approaches have been joined together (e.g., 5 or 10 heads). Lastly, the pre-training procedure of the fourth approach is based on a CNN decoder which has been placed on the backbone and tried to only reconstruct the original image with respect to the RMSE pixel-wise loss function. As the first three methods are relatively easy for a deep network to learn, the strong augmentation level has been considered for all three of them. Needless to say, that in the second and third approaches, random rotation augmentation has been removed. Moreover, in the last approach, no augment level has been used. Like previous part, each method has been trained three times on three pre-defined random seeds. Considering methods in this section do not require labels, all the AffectNet images (more than 1 million) can be suitable for self-supervised training. But all images in AffectNet are not face images. In other words, in 450,000 images with labels, 89,000 of them are faceless. This means that in 550,000 unlabeled images; there are over 100,000 faceless images which can be counted as noises and they are worthless for emotion recognition task as well as self-supervised pre-training. Thus, the 361,000 labeled images which include faces have been used for the training. We used the focal loss function for puzzle classification losses due to the fact that some face images are more different from the others. After training based on all the approaches and reaching convergence, the SSHs have been removed from top of the backbone, then its output has been evaluated in a nonlinear way on the eight AffectNet emotions. That is to say, we have trained a neural network with two layers to classify the AffectNet training set on top of the frozen pre-trained backbone of for all four SSL approaches. Results are shown in Table  2 . Additionally, we have fine-tuned all layers with SSL pre-trained backbones on AffectNet (table  3 ). In both nonlinear evaluation and fine-tuning settings, the no augment level has been selected. On one hand, as table 2 shows, features which have been trained by the SSL methods have been effective compared to the random classification. The puzzling approach and in-painting-pwl have gained more accuracy thought.\n\nOn the other hand, based on the fine-tuning results (table  3 ), we could see a backbone which has been pre-trained by a SSL task like in-painting-pwl could act differently on a downstream task whether doing fine-tuning or feature evaluation.",

Here, in all the puzzling SSHs, categorical cross-entropy has been used (Equation  1 ). We did not use focal loss due to the lower value compare to the cross-entropy loss function. It means that the SSHs loss values would decrease significantly after few epochs and the network could be forced towards the SH. Moreover, in the decoder loss function of the in-painting methods, the error rate has been enlarged with λ coefficient to make it be equal SH in the initial epochs (Equation  3 ).\n\nIn HMTL approach, due to hardware limitation we have considered random weights with the no and weak augment levels. Despite we have to recognize the location of regions in permuted images and the emotion label at the same time in the training step, we only give the original images to the network without doing permutation or cutout in the validation step, nevertheless. Accordingly, the validation step is only considered for the SH. Results are shown in figure  10  and table  5 .\n\nWe need to emphasize that the number of emotions is an important factor in the final result (Accuracy). When the contempt emotion is added to the labels and the number of emotion categories increases from seven to eight, the accuracy decreases 3% to 4%. In this paper, due to more complexity and generalization of eight labels, only the eight categories have been considered.\n\nAnother important point in the use of SSHs is the less tendency of the network to reach overfitting. Because deep networks with a small amount of data tend to overfit, this may indicate that SSHs improving performance on low data. To test this claim, we have trained by the proposed HMTL with a small percentage of the AffectNet training set images. That is to say, eight Ekman labels in the AffectNet training set have been considered and 20% of them have been randomly selected with a fixed random seed for training process. Need to mention that the distribution of emotion labels in the new training set is also similar to the original training set which means the subset is heavily imbalanced. Similarly, the weighted cross entropy loss function has been utilized for the SH. We have compared the results based on the SL and SL+SSL approaches. Due to the effect of augmentation on overfitting, the training process was performed with the no and weak augment levels. It is important to separate our work on low data regimes from semi-supervised learning where the number of labels and images for training varies. In fact, in the semisupervised learning method, a model is first pre-trained on usually large amounts of data and then fine-tuned on a limited number of labels. That is, the number of tags and images in semi-supervised learning is different while it is the same in our work.\n\nWe saw that if the Softmax layer removed from the Equation  3 , which acts as a normalizer for the representation, the training process becomes very unstable and sometimes collapses. In particular, this happens in low data regimes.\n\nThe results in table  4  show that when we are using hybrid architecture, the performance increases significantly. To illustrate the important regions in the images, several examples have been selected and the GradCam  [46]  method has been performed on them (figure  11 ). As figure 11 displays, by using HMTL, more attention is paid to the different parts of the images and consequently, the network has a better power in selecting the relevant features from faces.",

When the puzzle size was set to 4×4, the performance of the emotion recognition head showed a great decline. We think it may be due to the presence of unrelated puzzle pieces in the images to learn emotion labels which distracts the focus of learning procedure to different information. As shown in figure  12 , in the 4×4 puzzle size, some regions could contain unrelated information for emotion recognition.

We observed that as the number of puzzles and augmentation intensity is increased, this difference becomes greater.

SSHs only are used in the training stage and in the testing stage or inference time they are removed from the trained model. To do this, we chose proposed puzzling and in-painting SSL pre-text tasks to add them as the auxiliary heads to the supervised emotion recognition head. Results showed that utilizing proper self-supervised tasks could increase the accuracy of emotion recognition in different benchmarks both at different levels of augmentation and low amounts of data. With two proposed HMTL methods, we reached two new state-of-the-art result on AffectNet in the eight-emotion mode without using additional training data. We also evaluated our method on the head pose estimation and gender recognition datasets which concluded to decreasing in error rate.\n\nWe believe utilizing auxiliary self-supervised task besides a supervised task would impact many fields even beyond face-related problems.
