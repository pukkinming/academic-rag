Most existing works perform feature disentanglement and fusion to extract emotional contextual information from multi-modal features and emotion classification. After revisiting the characteristic of MERC, we argue that long-range contextual semantic information should be extracted in the feature disentanglement stage and the inter-modal semantic information consistency should be maximized in the feature fusion stage. Inspired by recent State Space Models (SSMs), Mamba can efficiently model long-distance dependencies. Therefore, in this work, we fully consider the above insights to further improve the performance of MERC. Specifically, on the one hand, in the feature disentanglement stage, we propose a Broad Mamba, which does not rely on a self-attention mechanism for sequence modeling, but uses state space models to compress emotional representation, and utilizes broad learning systems to explore the potential data distribution in broad space. Different from previous SSMs, we design a bidirectional SSM convolution to extract global context information. On the other hand, we design a multi-modal fusion strategy based on probability guidance to maximize the consistency of information between modalities. Experimental results show that the proposed method can overcome the computational and memory limitations of Transformer when modeling long-distance contexts, and has great potential to become a next-generation general architecture in MERC. \n CCS CONCEPTS • Computing methodologies → Discourse, dialogue and pragmatics; Non-negative matrix factorization; • Theory of computation → Fixed parameter tractability.",

      "text": "Emotion recognition in conversation  [2, 10, 39, 48, 55]  has received considerable research attention and has been widely used in various fields, e.g., emotion analysis  [20]  and public opinion warning  [56] , etc. Recently, research on Multi-modal Emotion Recognition in Conversation (MERC) has mainly focused on multimodality, i.e., text, video and audio  [4, 8, 35, 40, 46, 50] . As shown in Fig.  1 , MERC aims to identify emotion labels in sentences with text, video, and audio information. Unlike previous work  [26]  that only uses text information for emotion recognition, MERC improves the model's emotion understanding capabilities by introducing audio and video information  [19, 49] . The introduction of audio and video alleviates the limitation of insufficient semantic information caused by relying solely on text features.\n\nMany existing works  [33, 52, 62]  improve the performance of MERC by effectively extracting contextual semantic information of different modalities and fusing inter-modal complementary semantic information. By revisiting the characteristics of MERC, we argue that the core idea of MERC includes a feature disentanglement step and a feature fusion step.\n\nSpecifically, the goal of feature disentanglement is to extract the contextual semantic information most relevant to emotional features in multi-modal features  [54, 60] . Recent work on Transformers  [9, 30, 32]  has achieved great success in modeling long-range contextual semantic information. Compared with traditional Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs)  [29, 37] , the advantage of Transformer is that it can effectively provide global contextual semantic information through the attention mechanism in parallel. However, the quadratic complexity of the self-attention mechanism in Transformers poses challenges in terms of speed and memory when dealing with long-range context dependencies. Inspired by the state space models, Mamba with linear complexity is proposed to achieve efficient training and inference. Mamba's excellent scaling performance shows that it is a promising Transformer alternative for context modeling. Therefore, to efficiently extract long-distance contextual semantic information, we designed the broad Mamba, which incorporates the SSMs for data-dependent global emotional context modeling, and a broad learning system to explore the potential data distribution in the broad space. Different from previous SSMs, we design a bidirectional SSM convolution to extract global context information. In addition, we also introduce position encoding information to improve SSMs' ability to understand sequences at different positions.\n\nAfter completing feature disentanglement, the model needs to perform feature fusion to maximize the consistency of information between different modalities. The core idea of feature fusion is to assign different weights by determining the importance of different modal features to downstream tasks. Many cross-modal feature fusions have been proposed in existing MERC research, e.g., tensor fusion network  [61] , graph fusion network  [63] , attention fusion  [46] . However, the feature fusion process in previous works is relatively coarse-grained and cannot actually determine the contribution of each modal feature to downstream tasks. We argue that label information plays an important role in guiding multi-modal information fusion. Therefore, how to properly fuse multi-modality and determine the contribution of multi-modal features to downstream tasks in a fine-grained manner remains a challenge  [24, 41] .\n\nTo tackle the above problems, we propose an effective probabilityguided fusion mechanism to achieve multi-modal contextual feature fusion, which utilizes the predicted label probability of each modal feature as the weight vectors of the modal features. Compared with other feature fusion models for emotion recognition tasks, the proposed fusion method can utilize the predicted label probability information in a fine-grained manner to actually determine the contribution of different modal features to the emotion prediction task.\n\nTo evaluate the effectiveness and efficiency of our proposed method, we conduct extensive experiments on two widely used benchmark datasets, IEMOCAP and MELD. In fact, the proposed method achieves state-of-the-art performance with low computational consumption, and experimental results demonstrate its effectiveness and efficiency.\n\nOverall, our main contributions can be summarized as follows:\n\n• We propose a Broad Mamba, which combines a broad learning system for searching abstract emotional features in a broad space and a SSM for data-dependent global emotional context information extraction. Different from previous SSMs, we design a bidirectional SSM convolution to extract global context information. • We propose an effective probability-guided fusion mechanism to achieve multi-modal contextual feature fusion, which utilizes the predicted label probability of each modal feature as the weight vectors of the modal features.",

      "text": "In the early eras, GRU  [7]  and LSTM  [18]  are the de-facto standard network designs for Natural Language Processing (NLP). Many recurrent neural network architectures  [15, 16, 22, 29, 37]  have been proposed for various Multi-modal Emotion Recognition in Conversation (MERC). The pioneering work, Transformer changed the landscape by enabling efficient parallel computing under the premise of long sequence modeling. Transformer treats text as a series of 1D sequence data and applies an attention architecture to achieve sequence modeling. Transformer's surprising results on long sequence modeling and its scalability have encouraged considerable follow-up work for MERC  [6, 31, 32, 47, 64] . One line of works focus on achieving intra-modal and inter-modal information fusion. For example, CTNet  [32]  proposes a single Transformer and cross Transformer. CKETF  [12]  constructs a Context and Knowledge Enriched Transformer. TL-ERC applies the Transformer with the transfer learning. Another pioneering work, Graph Neural Network (GNN)  [57] [58] [59]  further improved the performance of ERC. The core idea of GNN is to learn the representation of nodes or graphs through the feature information of nodes and the connection relationships in the graph structure  [5, 42, 63] . For instance, DialogueGCN  [11]  proposes to use context information to build dialogue graphs. DER-GCN  [1]  fuses event relationships into speaker relationship graphs. These dominant follow-up works have demonstrated excellent performance and higher efficiency on various multi-modal conversational emotion recognition data sets by introducing attention mechanisms or GNNs. In this work, we draw inspiration from Mamba and explore the ability to build a state space model (SSM) based model to improve multi-modal emotion representation learning without efficient parallel sequence modeling using attention, while retaining the sequence modeling advantages of Transformer.",

      "text": "Broad Learning System (BLS) is different from traditional deep learning methods that it mainly focuses on discovering the relationship between features in the input data, rather than extracting features through multi-level nonlinear transformations. The core idea of BLS is to jointly solve the optimization problem by integrating the semantic information of feature nodes and enhancement nodes. Notably, the feature nodes and enhancement nodes only contain one layer of learnable network parameters, so BLS has faster inference speed than other deep learning architectures. The overall process of the BLS algorithm is shown in the Fig.  2 .\n\nSpecifically, for a given input data X ∈ R 𝑁 ×𝑀 , where 𝑁 represents the number of samples and 𝑀 represents the dimension of the feature. The generated feature nodes are defined as follows:\n\nwhere W 𝑧 𝑖 ∈ R 𝑀 ×𝑑 𝑧 and 𝛽 𝑧 ∈ R 1×𝑑 𝑧 are the learnable parameters. 𝑑 𝑧 is the embedding dimensions of generated features and 𝜙 is the activation function. The set of generated feature nodes is represented as\n\nwhere 𝑛 is the size of the set of generated feature nodes. Similarly, enhancement node features are defined as follows:\n\nwhere W ℎ 𝑖 ∈ R 𝑑 𝑧 ×𝑑 ℎ and 𝛽 𝑧 ∈ R 1×𝑑 ℎ are the learnable parameters. 𝑑 ℎ is the embedding dimensions of enhancement features. The set of enhancement feature nodes is represented as\n\nwhere 𝑚 is the size of the set of enhancement feature nodes.

Furthermore, to facilitate the model to capture the dependencies between long-distance positions in the sequence, we introduce sine and cosine position encoding embedding as follows:  (10)  where 𝑝𝑜𝑠 represents the position in the sequence. 𝑖 represents the dimension index of position encoding, 𝑖 = 0, 1, ..., 𝐷 -1.

As shown in Table  3 , we found that the performance of the model will decrease after removing PE, which indicates that positional encoding information is quite important for understanding contextual semantic information. Furthermore, without BLS, the performance of the model also degrades. The performance degradation is attributed to the underlying contextual data distribution which is also crucial for emotion prediction. Finally, when the PFM module is removed, the performance of the model drops sharply. Experimental results demonstrate the necessity of multi-modal feature fusion. Different modalities contribute differently to the model's understanding of emotional information, and using label probabilities can guide the model to adaptively learn the weights of different modal features to better integrate multi-modal features.\n\nAblation studies for multi-modal features. To show the impact of different modal features on experimental results, we conducted ablation experiments to verify the combination of different modal features. From the experimental results in Table  IV , it is found  that: (1) In the single-modal experimental results of the model, the accuracy of emotion recognition in text mode is far better than the other two modes, indicating that text features play a dominant role in emotion recognition. effect. The emotion recognition effect of video modality features is the worst (2) The emotion recognition effect using bimodal features is better than its own single-modality result. Furthermore, since text features play a dominant role in emotion recognition, this results in the bimodal feature combination with text modality performing better than the combination of acoustic and visual modalities. (3) The emotion recognition effect using three modal features is optimal. Experimental results prove the necessity of fusion of multi-modal features for emotion recognition.\n\nEffect of Different Fusion Strategies. To study the effectiveness of the probability-guided fusion method proposed in this paper, we compare it with some previous multi-modal fusion strategies:\n\n(1) Add: multi-modality is implemented by element-wise addition of multi-modal features. Information fusion. (2) Concatenate: directly concatenating multi-modal features. LFM: feature fusion is achieved by introducing a low-rank tensor fusion network.\n\nAs shown in Fig.  5 , compared with other fusion methods, the probability-guided fusion strategy we proposed has better emotion recognition effects on the two data sets. The results show that the emotion recognition effect of directly adding or concatenating multi-modal features to achieve multi-modal information fusion is relatively poor. The multi-modal information fusion effect of LMF is better than the adding method and the concatenating method. The probabilistic fusion strategy we propose introduces label information to guide the fusion of multi-modal information and further achieves parameter optimization of the model. Interestingly, the fusion effect of the concatenate method on the IEMOCAP data set is better than that of the add method, but the effect on the MELD data set is worse than that of the add method. This may be because the dimensionality of the multi-modal features of the MELD dataset is relatively high, so dimensionality disaster may occur by concatenating multi-modal information. In contrast, our proposed probabilistic guided model effectively uses label information to guide the consistency of multi-modal semantic information.",
