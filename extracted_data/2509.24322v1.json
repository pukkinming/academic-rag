      "text": "In recent years, large language models (LLMs) have driven major advances in language understanding, marking a significant step toward artificial general intelligence (AGI). With increasing demands for higherlevel semantics and cross-modal fusion, multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have emerged, integrating diverse information sources (e.g., text, vision, and audio) to enhance modeling and reasoning in complex scenarios. In AI for Science, multimodal emotion recognition and reasoning has become a rapidly growing frontier. While LLMs and MLLMs have achieved notable progress in this area, the field still lacks a systematic review that consolidates recent developments. To address this gap, this paper provides a comprehensive survey of LLMs and MLLMs for emotion recognition and reasoning, covering model architectures, datasets, and performance benchmarks. We further highlight key challenges and outline future research directions, aiming to offer researchers both an authoritative reference and practical insights for advancing this domain. To the best of our knowledge, this paper is the first attempt to comprehensively survey the intersection of MLLMs with multimodal emotion recognition and reasoning.

      "text": "In recent years, large language models (LLMs)  [15, 142]  have made significant progress in natural language processing (NLP). By expanding the scale of training data and the number of model parameters, LLMs have demonstrated unprecedented emergent capabilities, enabling them to perform well in many tasks, especially instruction following (IF)  [136] , in-context learning (ICL)  [130] , and chain-of-thought (CoT)  [138] . IF enables the model to understand and perform complex tasks, ICL enables the model to flexibly handle different problems based on context without explicit training, and chain-of-thought enhances the model's decision-making process through step-by-step reasoning.\n\nAlthough LLMs have performed well in many NLP tasks  [60]  and have also demonstrated amazing zero-shot and few-shot reasoning capabilities in some complex real-world applications  [38, 140, 166] , LLMs are essentially still \"blind\" to visual information. LLM working principle is mainly based on text data and cannot directly process multimodal data (e.g., images or videos). In contrast, large visual models (LVMs) can efficiently process and understand image content  [54, 105] . Through convolutional neural networks (CNNs)  [53, 107, 113]  and Transformers  [91, 95]  architectures, LVMs have demonstrated excellent performance in visual recognition and image generation  [86, 172] . However, despite their powerful ability to reason about visual information, LVMs have certain limitations in natural language understanding and generation, resulting in lagging or lack of flexibility in reasoning. Given the outstanding performance and complementarity of LLMs and LVMs in their respective fields, combining the advantages of both has become a hot topic of research, giving rise to the emerging field of multimodal large language models (MLLMs)  [63, 150] . Specifically, MLLMs are designed to receive, reason about, and output information from multiple modalities, such as text, images, audio, etc. Through cross-modal fusion, MLLMs enable models to process and understand more complex and diverse data, reason under multimodal inputs, and provide more accurate and rich outputs  [82] . The development of MLLM provides new perspectives and approaches for realizing true artificial intelligence, especially in tasks that require simultaneous understanding of language and visual information (e.g., visual question answering, image description generation, etc.), showing great potential and application value  [37, 99] .\n\nMultimodal emotion recognition and reasoning, as a challenging task, requires not only the model to extract emotion information from a single modality, but also to perform deep reasoning in multimodal interactions to understand and capture complex emotion expressions and contexts  [68, 81, 147, 164] . With the rapid advancement of MLLMs, the solutions to multimodal emotion recognition and reasoning tasks have also changed significantly  [21, 23, 149] . Through a unified generation paradigm, MLLMs are not only able to process multimodal data, but also to integrate information between multiple modalities, significantly improving the effect of emotion recognition and reasoning. It is worth noting that some MLLMs have been able to perform multimodal emotion recognition and reasoning without any additional training data, which means that they have strong zero-shot and few-shot reasoning capabilities  [10, 145] . Compared with traditional multimodal emotion recognition models, the latter usually rely on supervised learning and require a large amount of labeled data to fine-tune the model to adapt to different emotion recognition tasks  [2, 96, 106, 108, 110, 114] . MLLMs are able to surpass traditional multimodal emotion recognition models without the need for large-scale labeled data, which gives them a significant advantage in multimodal emotion recognition and reasoning tasks. More importantly, MLLMs can share knowledge across multiple modalities and process multiple data sources through joint training and reasoning, which provides stronger reasoning ability and higher accuracy.\n\nDue to the remarkable progress of LLMs and MLLMs in emotion recognition and reasoning, the interest and investment in these models in academia and industry have also shown a sharp growth trend. Therefore, this paper aims to explore the following key questions: (1) What is the current application status of LLMs and MLLMs in emotion recognition and reasoning tasks? We will review the relevant literature and analyze the specific usage and advantages of LLMs and MLLMs in emotion recognition and reasoning.  (2)  Have traditional multimodal emotion recognition methods been replaced by MLLMs, or can they effectively make up for the shortcomings of traditional methods? (3) What is the future development direction of MLLMs for multimodal emotion recognition and reasoning?\n\nTo answer the above questions, we made the first attempt to conduct a comprehensive and detailed survey of LLMs and MLLMs for emotion recognition and reasoning as shown in Fig.  1 . The goal of this study is to explore and summarize the current development and applications of LLMs and MLLMs in emotion recognition and reasoning tasks. In view of the rapid development of this field, our study not only aims to clarify the specific applications of these models in emotion recognition and reasoning, but also hopes to reveal the potential, limitations and future research directions of these models through systematic analysis. To this end, this paper first introduces the basic concepts and background of multimodal emotion recognition and reasoning, and reviews the preliminary related research results. Then, we focus on introducing the application paradigms of LLMs and MLLMs in emotion recognition and reasoning, and propose a unified framework to help understand how MLLMs process and reason about cross-modal data. Specifically, we classify the existing application paradigms of LLMs and MLLMs into two categories. (1) Parameter freezing applications: LLMs and MLLMs pre-trained models are able to perform zero-shot learning (ZSL)  [8, 50, 131]  and few-shot learning (FSL)  [13, 41, 70]  without much additional data, thanks to their strong language understanding capabilities. By freezing most of the model parameters and only adjusting a few key parameters, this approach greatly improves the efficiency of the model and reduces the need for labeled data  [16, 123, 135] . (2) Parameter tuning applications: LLMs and MLLMs require parameter tuning on specific tasks to further improve the accuracy and adaptability of the model  [133, 171] . The Full Parameter Tuning method involves fine-tuning the parameters of the entire model to ensure that it can better handle modal data in emotion recognition tasks  [87, 161] . Efficient Parameter Tuning focuses on using optimization algorithms (e.g., learning rate adjustment, progressive training, etc.) to effectively adjust a few parameters of the model with less training data and computing resources, thereby improving performance under resource-constrained conditions  [67] . Finally, we explore the current research bottlenecks and challenges, and conclude by identifying potential frontiers for future research, as well as relevant challenges that inspire further exploration.\n\nIn summary, our contributions are as follows:\n\n• New Taxonomy: We provide a new taxonomy including (1) parameter-frozen and (2) parameter-tuning methods, which provides a unified view to understand LLMs and MLLMs for emotion recognition and reasonging. To the best of our knowledge, we present the first comprehensive review of LLMs and MLLMs for emotion recognition and reasoning.   [3, 109, 112, 114] . Unlike unimodal recognition, multimodal emotion recognition integrates complementary and redundant information across modalities, thereby enabling more robust and reliable affective inference  [2] . Formally, given an input set of 𝑀 ∈ {1, 2, . . . 𝑚} modalities as follows: X = {𝑋 (1) , 𝑋 (2) , . . . , 𝑋 (𝑚) }\n\nwhere each modality 𝑋 (𝑚) ∈ R 𝑑 𝑛 ×𝑇 represents a temporal sequence of dimension 𝑑 𝑛 over 𝑇 time steps, the task of multimodal emotion recognition is to learn a mapping function 𝑓 : X → Y, where Y denotes the label space of emotions (categorical, dimensional, or mixed).\n\nTo capture inter-modal and intra-modal dependencies, multimodal emotion recognition models often introduce a latent joint representation z that integrates modality-specific embeddings: z = F 𝜙 1 (𝑋 (1) ), 𝜙 2 (𝑋 (2) ), . . . , 𝜙 𝑚 (𝑋 (𝑚) )\n\n(\n\nwhere 𝜙 𝑚 (•) denotes the feature extractor for modality 𝑚, and F (•) is the fusion function capturing cross-modal interactions. The final prediction is obtained via:\n\nwith 𝜃 denoting the trainable parameters of the model. Therefore, multimodal emotion recognition can be rigorously defined as the problem of learning the optimal 𝜃 * such that:\n\nwhere D is the multimodal dataset and L (•) is an emotion recognition loss (e.g., cross-entropy for classification or mean squared error for dimensional regression). Multimodal emotion reasoning. While multimodal emotion recognition focuses on mapping multimodal inputs to emotion labels, multimodal emotion reasoning extends the task by generating not only predictions but also interpretable explanations or causal reasoning chains  [117, 158] . Formally, the reasoning-enhanced task can be defined as follows:\n\nwhere R denotes the reasoning space, consisting of causal relations, evidential supports, or natural language explanations. A typical probabilistic formulation is\n\nwhere 𝑦 ∈ Y is the predicted emotion label and 𝑟 ∈ R represents its associated reasoning path. This expansion highlights the importance of transparency, explainability, and causal understanding of reasoning. This shift is crucial for building trustworthy multimodal emotion systems.",

      "text": "The evolution of Multimodal Emotion Recognition has been driven by the need to effectively integrate heterogeneous signals and capture both their complementary and conflicting cues. Early approaches primarily relied on feature-level fusion  [27, 170]  and decision-level fusion  [120, 167] , where unimodal features were either concatenated or late-averaged to yield the final prediction: ) ); 𝜙 2 (𝑋 (2) ); . . . ; 𝜙 𝑚 (𝑋 (𝑚) )]\n\nwhere\n\nTo enable cross-modal interaction, these modality-specific features are projected into a shared embedding space via learnable transformation matrices W (𝑚) , yielding\n\nwhere vec(•) denotes vectorization. The multimodal fusion is then performed as:\n\nwhere denotes a modality fusion operator (e.g., concatenation, bilinear pooling, or tensor fusion), and 𝜙 (•) denotes a non-linear transformation. This fusion mechanism not only preserves intramodal representations but also enables cross-modal interactions, thereby capturing emotion-relevant dependencies across modalities.\n\nRecurrent Neural Networks (RNNs), and especially Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) models  [100] , are widely adopted to capture sequential dependencies in speech and conversational data. Formally, given 𝑚 modalities, we first compute modality-specific gates:\n\nand candidate memory content as:\n\nThen, multimodal fusion is introduced at the cell state level via:\n\nwhere 𝛼 (𝑚) are learnable or attention-based modality weights ensuring adaptive contribution from each modality. Finally, the hidden state is updated as:\n\nThese advances enabled models to learn temporal emotion dynamics rather than relying solely on static fusion. The introduction of attention mechanisms further enhanced multimodal emotion recognition by allowing selective focus on salient cross-modal cues  [96, 110] . Cross-modal attention is formalized as follows:\n\nwhere q (𝑖 ) 𝑡 and k ( 𝑗 ) 𝑡 are query and key representations from modality 𝑖 and 𝑗. Building upon this principle, Transformer architectures enabled scalable modeling of long-range dependencies through multi-head self-attention  [72, 91] :\n\nwhere Q, K, V denoting query, key, and value matrices. Transformers have since become a dominant backbone in multimodal emotion recognition due to their ability to align asynchronous multimodal signals at scale. To extend attention into multimodal contexts, modality-specific queries, keys, and values {Q (𝑚) , K (𝑚) , V (𝑚) } 𝑀 𝑚=1 are first derived. Then, cross-modal attention aggregates complementary signals by computing:\n\nThis allows each modality 𝑖 to selectively attend to relevant information from other modalities 𝑗.\n\nFinally, the fused multimodal representation at time 𝑡 is obtained as\n\nThis formulation enables both intra-modal temporal modeling and cross-modal interaction, thereby aligning asynchronous multimodal signals and enhancing emotion-related representation learning. Beyond sequence-based modeling, graph neural networks (GNNs) advanced multimodal emotion recognition by representing multimodal interactions as structured graphs  [94, 111, 115, 116] . Given a multimodal graph G = (V, E), with nodes denoting modality-specific features and edges encoding inter-modal relations, message passing iteratively refines node embeddings. To explicitly capture cross-modal interactions, we extend the graph to a multimodal setting. Each node is associated with a modality index 𝑚 ∈ {audio, text, video} and initialized with modality-specific feature h (0,𝑚) 𝑣 . During message passing, cross-modal attention weights are introduced to adaptively fuse signals from different modalities:\n\nwhere N (𝑣) is the neighborhood of node 𝑣, 𝛼 (𝑚←𝑛)   𝑢𝑣 denotes the attention coefficient that controls the contribution of modality 𝑛 at node 𝑢 to modality 𝑚 at node 𝑣. The final multimodal embedding is obtained by fusing across modalities:\n\nThis formulation enables GNN-based multimodal emotion recognition to (i) preserve modalityspecific structural information, (ii) adaptively integrate complementary cues through cross-modal message passing, and (iii) mitigate modality imbalance and redundancy by dynamically weighting heterogeneous edges.",

In this paradigm, modality-specific encoders are employed to extract unimodal features. For example, text inputs are processed by a pre-trained text encoder to obtain embeddings. To leverage the powerful reasoning capability of LLMs, these embeddings are further projected into a unified textual space before being fed into the LLM, as illustrated in Fig.  2 (a). Formally, let 𝜙 𝑚 (•) denote the encoder for modality 𝑚 ∈ {text}, the embedding is defined as:\n\nThe final prediction is then generated by the LLM as:\n\nDespite their simplicity, such pipelines suffer from one main limitations: the reliance on textual features alone and the inability to capture fine-grained cross-modal interactions, which are particularly crucial for affective understanding.

Unlike LLM-based pipelines that retrofit unimodal embeddings into the textual space, MLLMs are inherently designed to integrate heterogeneous signals in an end-to-end manner. As shown in Fig.  2 (b), embeddings from text, audio, and video encoders are aligned with the token space of the language model through connector modules, which serve as the critical bridge between modality encoders and the generative reasoning capability of LLMs. The design of these connectors has gradually evolved to support more expressive multimodal alignment  [131] . The simplest approach employs a multilayer perceptron (MLP) to linearly project modality embeddings into the token dimension of the LLM, providing a lightweight yet effective alignment mechanism. To further enhance cross-modal interaction, Q-Former  [62]  structures have been introduced, which rely on a set of learnable queries to selectively extract salient semantic features from modality embeddings before injecting them into the LLM, thereby",

      "section_name": "Parameter-Frozen Paradigm",
      "text": "In the parameter-frozen paradigm, the backbone LLM/MLLM remains unchanged and task adaptation is realized purely through prompting and in-context specification  [58, 133] . This setting is particularly attractive for multimodal emotion recognition and reasoning because (i) it avoids expensive fine-tuning on large models, and (ii) it enables rapid transfer across datasets with heterogeneous label spaces. Let 𝑋 = {𝑥 𝑡 , 𝑥 𝑎 , 𝑥 𝑣 } denote text, audio, and video inputs after modality-specific encoding or serialization into model-acceptable inputs, and let I denote a task instruction template that defines the goal (e.g., \"Infer the speaker's emotion and briefly explain the evidence. \"). The model produces a distribution over label strings given the constructed prompt Π(𝑋, I):\n\nwhere Θ are frozen parameters and 𝜈 (𝑦) is a verbalizer mapping each class 𝑦 to one or more label strings (e.g., \"happy\", \"joyful\"). The final decision is ŷ = arg max 𝑦 𝑃 Θ (𝑦 | 𝑋, I), optionally with length normalization when 𝜈 (𝑦) contains multi-token strings.\n\nZero-shot learning. Zero-shot multimodal emotion recognition and reasoning relies solely on natural-language instructions without task-specific examples  [77, 150] . A well-engineered prompt serializes heterogeneous evidence into a structured context that highlights affective cues while minimizing spurious correlations. In LLM-based pipelines, non-text modalities are first converted into textual evidence snippets, e.g., prosodic summaries, facial action units, and salient visual events-through auxiliary encoders, and concatenated with raw transcripts using role tags (e.g., <Text>, <Audio-Prosody>, <Visual-AU>). In MLLM-based pipelines, raw embeddings are passed alongside textual tokens, but the model is still queried through instructions; hence Eq. (  25 ) applies with Π(•) injecting modality tokens or connector-produced embeddings. To reduce prompt sensitivity and improve robustness, zero-shot systems commonly employ (i) instruction variants and prompt ensembling with majority voting or probability averaging, (ii) self-consistency with reasoning where latent rationales 𝑟 are sampled and marginalized as follows:\n\nand (iii) contextual calibration, which subtracts a prior estimated from a content-free prompt to alleviate label-word frequency bias. Zero-shot decoding can output both a label and an explanation, providing weak but valuable interpretability for auditing emotion decisions.\n\nRepresentative systems have instantiated these principles in diverse ways. CLIP  [102]  pioneered large-scale contrastive training on image-text pairs, enabling zero-shot transfer simply by casting downstream tasks into natural-language prompts. Building on this idea, Qwen-Audio  [26]  and Video-LLaVA  [79]  extend frozen LLMs with lightweight modality encoders for audio and video streams, respectively, illustrating that non-text signals can be seamlessly injected into zero-shot pipelines. MiniGPT-v2  [17]  and LLaVA-Next  [83]  further refine visual-language alignment by introducing enhanced connector modules, thereby improving the sensitivity of emotion-related cues under zeroshot prompting. Scaling up this paradigm, InternVL2.5  [20]  and Qwen-VL  [5]  leverage extensive multimodal pretraining to unify images and videos, demonstrating strong generalization across recognition and reasoning benchmarks. Beyond perception, reasoning-oriented variants such as GPT-4 (CoT) [1] highlight the benefit of integrating chain-of-thought prompting, which enhances interpretability by generating intermediate rationales without any parameter updates.\n\nFew-shot learning. Few-shot multimodal emotion recognition and reasoning augments the instruction with 𝑘 demonstration pairs {(𝑋 𝑖 , 𝑦 𝑖 )} 𝑘 𝑖=1 injected into the prompt as in-context exemplars  [13, 70] . The predictive distribution is\n\nwhere the selection of D 𝑘 is crucial. Effective strategies balance relevance to the query and diversity across emotions and modalities, often via embedding-based retrieval with a determinantal or max-min objective to avoid redundancy  [123] . Demonstrations should expose the model to prototypical prosodic contours, facial micro-expressions, and discourse contexts (e.g., irony, negation) that are underrepresented in pre-training. Ordering also matters: placing task definition first, then structured exemplars (\"context → rationale → label\"), and finally the query tends to reduce hallucination. For classification with free-form generation, a rationale-then-verbalizer template first eliciting a short explanation 𝑟 and then constraining the final answer to 𝜈 (Y) often improves calibration and stability. When label spaces differ across datasets, dynamic verbalizers provide a principled bridge by defining synonyms per class and aggregating token probabilities as in Eq. (  25 ). Representative few-shot systems have further substantiated these principles. Otter  [58]  and BingChat  [163]  illustrate how general-purpose large language models can be adapted to multimodal settings with only a handful of in-context exemplars, showing consistent improvements over zeroshot prompting. LVLMs  [57]  extend this approach by explicitly integrating visual evidence with frozen LLMs, thereby enhancing the model's ability to capture subtle affective cues such as facial micro-expressions in few-shot contexts. Domain-specific adaptations like EMOTIC  [34]  demonstrate that curated multimodal demonstrations can guide models toward recognizing nuanced emotional states beyond basic categories. At a larger scale, Flamingo  [4]  exemplifies the state of the art in multimodal few-shot learning by introducing a gated cross-attention mechanism that allows visual tokens to interact directly with frozen LLM layers, enabling strong performance across a wide variety of benchmarks without full fine-tuning. Subsequent works such as ARC-LLM  [35]  and Exp-CLIP  [168]  push this direction further by leveraging explicit rationales or structured demonstrations, improving interpretability while mitigating label imbalance. Collectively, these systems show that few-shot learning provides a pragmatic balance between efficiency and adaptability, making it an attractive paradigm for emotion recognition and reasoning where annotated data is scarce yet diverse affective cues must be reliably captured.",

      "text": "Unlike the parameter-frozen setting, the parameter-tuning paradigm adapts the internal weights of LLMs/MLLMs to the target task, thereby improving domain specialization and calibration for multimodal emotion recognition and reasoning  [87, 171] . Let 𝜙 𝑚 be modality encoders for 𝑚 ∈ {text, audio, video}, 𝑔 𝜓 the connector(s), and 𝑓 Θ the LLMs/MLLMs with parameters Θ. Given D = {(𝑋, 𝑦, 𝑟 )} where 𝑋 = {𝑥 𝑡 , 𝑥 𝑎 , 𝑥 𝑣 }, 𝑦 is a discrete label or continuous affect (valence-arousal), and 𝑟 is an optional rationale, a generic supervised objective is  (28)  where L task is cross-entropy or MSE for continuous affect; L gen is a token-level negative loglikelihood for explanation sequences; L align often adopts a contrastive InfoNCE  [44]  between modality summaries 𝑢 𝑖 and textual anchors 𝑣 𝑖 as follows:\n\nand L temp encourages smooth predictions across time for videos, e.g.,\n\nwhere 𝑝 𝑡 is the distribution at time 𝑡. Class imbalance is commonly handled via class-balanced weighting 𝛼 𝑦 ∝ 1-𝛽 1-𝛽 𝑛𝑦 or focal loss. Full-parameter tuning. Full fine-tuning  [148, 154]  updates all parameters of the backbone LLM/MLLM as shown in Fig.  4 , the connectors, and optionally the modality encoders:\n\nThis yields the greatest flexibility, facilitating domain-specific lexical cues, prosodic-linguistic coupling, and long-context dialogue reasoning but demands substantial memory and compute. Practical recipes include stage-wise training (first warm up 𝑔 𝜓 and cross-attention, then unfreeze upper Transformer blocks), mixed-precision with gradient checkpointing, and curriculum schedules that progress from single-utterance supervision to multi-turn dialogue windows. Instruction tuning with multimodal emotion recognition and reasoning-style prompts further improves alignment between training signals and inference-time usage; when high-quality human preferences on explanations are available, one may add preference optimization (e.g., DPO  [139] ) with a pairwise  Video frames are encoded by a visual encoder and mapped to the LLM token space by multiple visual projectors. A projector fusion gate with learnable coefficients (𝜔 1 , 𝜔 2 , 𝜔 3 ) aggregates the projected features and emits visual tokens. Audio is processed by an audio encoder and projector to produce audio tokens, while the text instruction is embedded by a text encoder. The resulting visual, audio, and text tokens are interleaved into the pretrained LLM's token stream for joint reasoning  [165] .\n\nobjective for preferred 𝑦 + over 𝑦 -as follows:\n\nRepresentative full-tuning approaches have demonstrated the strengths and limitations of this paradigm. Early multimodal systems such as VisualBERT  [66]  and UNITER  [19]  established the foundation by fully fine-tuning pretrained transformers on paired image-text datasets, achieving strong performance in tasks like visual question answering and image-text retrieval. Building on these successes, video-oriented models such as VideoMAE  [128]  and Video-LLaMA  [22]  extended full-parameter tuning to spatiotemporal settings, showing that large-scale video pretraining coupled with complete fine-tuning yields substantial gains in downstream multimodal reasoning tasks. OneLLM  [42]  and LLaMA-VID  [69]  exemplify more recent efforts that scale this strategy to cover multiple modalities simultaneously, relying on end-to-end optimization to align speech, vision, and language under a unified backbone. Similarly, Chat-UniVi  [52]  integrates full-tuning with dialogue-style supervision, demonstrating that updating all parameters can improve long-context reasoning and multimodal dialogue alignment. While these models underscore the versatility and performance benefits of full-parameter tuning, they also reveal the accompanying computational burdens, motivating the exploration of more efficient alternatives such as parameter-efficient tuning.\n\nParameter-efficient tuning. To lower cost while retaining most gains of full fine-tuning, parameter-efficient tuning (PET)  [171]  updates a small, carefully placed subset of parameters, keeping the base weights frozen as shown in Fig.  5 . Popular instantiations include Adapter-tuning  [49] , Prefix/Prompt-tuning  [133, 138] , and LoRA  [45] /IA 3  [85] /BitFit  [11]  families. Adapter-tuning inserts a bottleneck MLP in each block and learns only the adapter weights as follows:\n\nPrefix/Prompt-tuning prepends learnable key/value vectors to each attention layer; if 𝐾, 𝑉 are original keys/values, the attention uses K = [𝐾 𝑝 ; 𝐾], Ṽ = [𝑉 𝑝 ; 𝑉 ] with trainable prefixes (𝐾 𝑝 , 𝑉 𝑝 ) while freezing backbone weights, thereby steering attention without changing 𝑊 𝑞 ,𝑊 𝑘 ,𝑊 𝑣 .",

In MLLMs, PET is frequently combined with connector tuning (train 𝑔 𝜓 and cross-attention blocks, keep the language core frozen), or partial unfreezing of the last 𝐿 Transformer blocks to better adapt discourse-level reasoning while keeping compute bounded.\n\nRepresentative PET-based systems have validated the practicality of this paradigm in multimodal emotion recognition and reasoning.

VideoChat2  [65]  further improves alignment by combining low-rank adapters with cross-attention, highlighting the scalability of PET for complex video-language benchmarks. Emotion-specific adaptations such as Emotion-LLaMA  [21]  demonstrate that parameter-efficient designs can preserve sensitivity to subtle affective states when domain-specific supervision is scarce. At the same time, SALMON  [124]  and mPLUG-Owl  [152]  show how adapter-style connectors can be tuned alongside frozen backbones to support flexible multimodal extensions.

      "text": "In multimodal large language model research for emotion recognition, the use of benchmark datasets is essential for algorithm validation and performance evaluation. As shown in Table  1 , we summarize several commonly adopted multimodal emotion recognition datasets. Below, we provide a brief description of each dataset. HUMAINE  [32] : The HUMAINE database is one of the earliest large-scale resources dedicated to affective computing and emotion recognition. The dataset contains both naturalistic and experimentally induced emotional expressions, spanning multiple modalities such as audio, video, and physiological signals. Importantly, it provides detailed manual annotations of emotional states based on categorical labels (e.g., joy, anger) as well as dimensional descriptors (e.g., arousal, valence).\n\nVAM  [40] : The Vera am Mittag (VAM) corpus consists of spontaneous emotional expressions extracted from the German television talk show Vera am Mittag, providing a rich collection of\n\nnatural audio-visual interactions. Each segment is annotated using dimensional emotion descriptors-valence, arousal, and dominance by multiple human raters, ensuring both reliability and fine-grained analysis of affective states.\n\nYoutube  [97] : The YouTube dataset comprises video clips collected from YouTube, capturing spontaneous expressions of opinion across diverse topics and speakers. Each clip contains audio, visual, and textual modalities, with sentiment annotations assigned at the utterance level.\n\nAFEW  [30] : The Acted Facial Expressions in the Wild (AFEW) dataset is constructed from a diverse collection of movie excerpts, containing audio-visual samples that encompass a wide range of speakers, contexts, and environmental conditions such as varying lighting, and occlusions. Each sample is annotated with one of the basic emotion categories (e.g., anger, happiness, sadness).\n\nAM-FED  [93] : Affectiva-MIT Facial Expression Dataset (AM-FED) contains more than 1,500 video recordings comprising over 242 hours of spontaneous facial behavior. Each video is annotated with affective labels, covering both basic emotions and continuous affective dimensions.\n\nAFEW-VA  [31] : The Acted Facial Expressions in the Wild-Valence and Arousal (AFEW-VA) dataset extends the original AFEW corpus by introducing continuous annotations of emotional dimensions. Specifically, it provides frame-level labels for valence and arousal in video clips extracted from movies, thereby enabling fine-grained analysis of affective dynamics.\n\nLIRIS-ACCEDE  [9] : The LIRIS-ACCEDE corpus consists of more than 9,800 short movie excerpts carefully selected from Creative Commons films, covering a broad range of genres, visual styles, and emotional contexts. Each clip is annotated with continuous valence and arousal ratings.\n\nEMILYA  [36] : The EMILYA corpus contains a wide range of motion capture recordings in which actors perform daily actions under different induced emotional states such as happiness, anger, sadness, and fear. Each sequence is annotated with categorical emotion labels as well as dimensional descriptors of valence and arousal.\n\nSEWA  [55] : The SEWA database contains audio-visual recordings of more than 400 participants engaged in naturalistic dyadic interactions across six different cultural backgrounds. Each recording is richly annotated at multiple levels, including continuous valence, arousal, and liking dimensions.\n\nCMU-MOSEI  [155] : The CMU Multimodal Opinion Sentiment and Emotion Intensity (CMU-MOSEI) dataset contains more than 23,000 annotated video segments collected from over 1,000 speakers across a wide range of topics on YouTube. Annotations cover both sentiment (from highly negative to highly positive) and six basic emotion categories, with continuous intensity scores.\n\niMiGUE  [89] : The iMiGUE comprises more than 3,000 video samples collected from over 60 participants, with deliberate anonymization to remove identity-related cues such as facial appearance. Each sequence is annotated with both categorical emotion labels and dimensional descriptors.\n\nDFEW  [51] : The DFEW dataset comprises 16,372 video clips extracted from movies, capturing a wide spectrum of real-world complexities as shown in Fig.  7 . Each video clip is annotated through a rigorous crowdsourcing pipeline involving 12 expert annotators, with every clip independently labeled ten times to ensure annotation reliability. The dataset provides both single-label annotations covering the seven basic emotion categories and 7-dimensional expression distribution vectors.\n\nMER2023  [74] : The MER 2023 dataset was specifically designed to evaluate system robustness through three complementary tracks as shown in Fig.  7 . The MER-MULTI track requires participants to recognize both discrete categorical emotions and continuous dimensional attributes. The MER-NOISE track introduces artificial noise into test videos to systematically assess modality robustness,. The MER-SEMI track provides large volumes of unlabeled samples.\n\nEMER  [75] : The Explainable Multimodal Emotion Recognition (EMER) seeks to address the inherent subjectivity and ambiguity of affective labeling as shown in Fig.  7 . Each instance in the dataset not only contains multimodal signals (text, audio, and video), but is also paired with explanatory rationales that justify the emotion annotations.\n\nMERR  [23] : The Multimodal Emotion Recognition in Real-world (MERR) dataset integrates audio, visual, and textual modalities with rich affective annotations as shown in Fig.  7 . Each instance is labeled with both categorical emotions and continuous sentiment dimensions.\n\nDEEMO  [59] : The DEEMO corpus contains audio-visual-textual recordings paired with annotations covering categorical emotions, dimensional descriptors, and reasoning rationales, enabling not only recognition but also interpretability in emotion analysis.\n\nEmotionBench  [104] : The EmoBench dataset is a recently introduced benchmark specifically designed to assess the emotional intelligence of large language models (LLMs) as shown in Fig.  8 . EmoBench provides a comprehensive suite of emotion-related evaluations, including emotion recognition, cause identification, empathy assessment, and reasoning about affective situations. The dataset is linguistically diverse, containing carefully curated text-based scenarios that span a wide spectrum of emotional states and social contexts.\n\nMOSABench  [117] : The MOSABench corpus is designed to evaluate the fine-grained sentiment understanding capabilities of multimodal large language models (MLLMs). MOSABench emphasizes complex real-world scenes containing multiple objects and entities, each associated with distinct sentiment cues. The dataset pairs images with structured annotations covering object-level sentiment labels, relational context, and overall scene-level affect. MM-InstructEval  [150] : The MM-InstructEval benchmark is designed to assess the multimodal reasoning capabilities of large language models under zero-shot settings. It encompasses a broad spectrum of tasks that require integrating and reasoning over textual and visual modalities, including visual question answering, commonsense reasoning with images, multimodal entailment, and instruction following grounded in visual context.\n\nEIBench  [80] : The EIBench benchmark is specifically designed to evaluate the emotional intelligence of multimodal large language models (MLLMs). EIBench emphasizes higher-level emotional reasoning, including understanding the causes of emotions, interpreting multimodal affective cues, and generating contextually appropriate empathetic responses.",

Once fine-tuning is allowed, video-centric foundations (e.g., masked autoencoding families and spatiotemporal learners) overtake zero-shot LLM baselines by a substantial margin, with pronounced gains on difficult categories like disgust, fear, and surprise. The class-wise distribution further indicates that neutral or high-arousal emotions are easier, while subtle negative states remain challenging, suggesting that model capacity alone is insufficient without targeted temporal supervision and calibrated class priors.",

Two consistent trends stand out.

Second, affect-oriented instruction tuning yields robust gains across heterogeneous label spaces, improving both word-level sentiment understanding (MOSI/MOSEI) and multi-party dialogue emotion tracking (MELD).

      "section_name": "Temporal Reasoning In Multimodal Emotion Understanding",
      "text": "A critical yet underexplored challenge in multimodal emotion recognition lies in modeling longrange and cross-modal temporal dependencies. Emotional states evolve dynamically over time, often manifesting through subtle, asynchronous cues across modalities. For instance, a delayed facial reaction following a spoken utterance, or a gradual shift in vocal pitch preceding a visible expression of distress. However, most existing multimodal large language models (MLLMs) either process inputs in fixed-length, non-overlapping windows or rely on static fusion mechanisms that ignore temporal ordering altogether. Even when recurrent or transformer-based encoders are employed, they often treat each modality independently before late fusion, thereby failing to capture inter-modal temporal alignment, such as whether a smile coincides with a positive lexical choice or contradicts it. Moreover, standard self-attention mechanisms in vision-language transformers are not inherently designed for fine-grained temporal reasoning. They may attend to salient frames or tokens but struggle to model causal progression, emotional inertia (e.g., lingering sadness after a triggering event), or anticipatory cues (e.g., rising tension before an outburst). This limitation is exacerbated in real-world scenarios where modalities are sampled at heterogeneous rates (e.g., 30 Hz video vs. 16 kHz audio) and exhibit variable latency or missing segments.\n\nTo address these issues, future MLLMs for emotion recognition should incorporate temporally grounded cross-modal architectures. Promising directions include: (1) synchronous temporal alignment modules that learn modality-specific time warping functions to align affective events across streams; (2) state-space models or neural ODEs that model emotion as a continuous latent trajectory; and (3) causal transformer variants with explicit memory buffers or recurrence to maintain emotional context over extended interactions. Additionally, benchmarks must evolve beyond frame-level or utterance-level labels to provide dense temporal annotations of emotional dynamics, enabling models to learn not just what emotion is present, but how it unfolds.",

Parameter-efficient tuning methods such as LoRA and QLoRA  [29]  should be extended to multimodal contexts, enabling adaptation to emotion recognition tasks without prohibitive memory and energy costs. Beyond fine-tuning, modular adapters  [39]  specialized for affective features could provide a lightweight pathway for injecting emotional sensitivity into general-purpose MLLMs. Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) frameworks  [78]  also hold promise, as they allow selective activation of modalityspecific experts during inference, reducing unnecessary computation while preserving task accuracy. Multi-scale temporal modeling represents another promising avenue: by first capturing coarse emotional trends at lower granularity and then refining local details such as micro-expressions or vocal tremors, models can achieve a more efficient trade-off between latency and fidelity. Selfsupervised pretraining on large, in-the-wild multimodal corpora will be indispensable to improve generalization across domains and demographics, as affective signals are inherently diverse and context-dependent. However, efficiency must also extend to deployment: quantization, pruning, and hardware-aware compilation should be systematically studied to enable real-time inference on mobile and wearable devices, thereby democratizing access to affective intelligence technologies.",
