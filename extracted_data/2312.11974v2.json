      "text": "Speech Emotion Recognition (SER) has become a growing focus of research in human-computer interaction. Spatiotemporal features play a crucial role in SER, yet current research lacks comprehensive spatiotemporal feature learning. This paper focuses on addressing this gap by proposing a novel approach. In this paper, we employ Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) with varying kernel sizes for spatial and temporal feature extraction. Additionally, we introduce Squeeze-and-Excitation (SE) modules to capture and fuse multi-scale features, facilitating effective information fusion for improved emotion recognition and a deeper understanding of the temporal evolution of speech emotion. Moreover, we employ skip-connections and Spatial Dropout (SD) layers to prevent overfitting and increase the model's depth. Our method outperforms the previous state-of-the-art method, achieving an average UAR and WAR improvement of 1.62% and 1.32%, respectively, across six benchmark SER datasets. Further experiments demonstrated that our method can fully extract spatiotemporal features in low-resource conditions.",

      "text": "Emotion recognition plays a crucial role in human-computer interaction, especially in cases like phone customer service and voice assistants, where only speech data is available. As a result, the direct automatic identification of human emotions and emotional states from speech is growing in significance  [1] .\n\nExtracting features from speech has always been an important factor in recognizing speech emotion. Traditional machine learning methods  [2, 3]  like Support Vector Machines (SVM) mainly rely on the effective extraction of handcrafted features. In recent times, with the continuous advancement of deep learning, profound changes have been brought about in speech processing due to the ability of Deep Neural Networks (DNN) to extract intricate features directly from data.\n\nConvolutional Neural Network (CNN)  [4, 5]  are highly effective in detecting and capturing complex features in data. Yenigalla et al.  [9]  improved recognition rates by using manually crafted phoneme sequences and spectrograms. Aftab et al.  [14]  extracted spectral, temporal, and spectral-temporal dependency features using three different filter sizes. Temporal neural networks like Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM)  [6]  and Temporal Convolutional Network (TCN) are widely applied in speech recognition to capture dynamic temporal changes in speech signals. Zhao et al.  [7]  extensively utilized CNN and Bi-LSTM to learn spatiotemporal features. Additionally, besides spatiotemporal features, capturing distant dependency relationships for context modeling is crucial for SER. Ye et al.  [16]  proposed a time-aware bidirectional multi-scale network called TIM-Net, achieving significant accuracy improvement in recognition. However, these methods suffer from the following drawbacks: 1) They extracted a large number of irrelevant features without filtering, causing the discriminator to learn these features. 2) They lacked the combination of local frequency features and long-term temporal features. 3) They lacked suitable regularization mechanisms when employing deeper networks for feature extraction, increasing the risk of overfitting.\n\nTo overcome the limitations of existing methods, we propose a novel approach, and we name the network the Multi-Scale Squeeze-and-Excitation Network, termed MS-SENet. We employ convolutional kernels of different sizes for the initial extraction of multi-scale spatial and temporal features in speech emotion recognition. Concurrently, we introduce Squeeze-and-Excitation (SE) modules to capture and fully exploit these multi-scale features. Moreover, we employ skipconnections and Spatial Dropout (SD) layers to prevent overfitting and increase the model's depth.",

We set the sampling rate to match the original sampling rate of each corpus and segmented the audio signal into 50-ms frames using a Hamming window, with a 12.5-ms overlap. Following the application of a 2048-point Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) to each frame, we perform Mel-scale triangular filterbank analysis on the speech signal. Subsequently, the inverse Discrete Cosine Transform is applied to calculate the MFCC for each frame, with the first 39 coefficients selected for model training.",

      "text": "We propose a novel feature fusion method, which mainly utilizes various convolutional kernels for the initial extraction of spatial and temporal features in speech emotion recognition. It employs SE modules for the selection and weighting of multi-scale features, further fusing them with the original information at multiple scales. Fig.  1  presents the network architecture of the method in Body Part I: Time-Frequency Feature Extraction. To enhance the robustness of feature fusion, the Time-Frequency Fusion Block incorporates a SD layer. Next, we provide a detailed introduction to each component.\n\nIn the Time-Frequency Fusion Block, due to the feature extraction of multi-dimensional signals, it's customary to individually account for each dimension when calculating receptive fields. Therefore, we employed a widely-used technique, employing three parallel convolutional kernels of dimensions 9 × 1, 1 × 11, and 3 × 3 to extract the spectral, temporal, and spectral-temporal dependencies in MFCCs.\n\nIn the subsequent stages, we opted not to employ pooling layers and instead utilized SD layers. As shown in Fig.  2 , SD layer can randomly sets all values in a specific dimension to zero. This decision was mainly driven by the following Spatial Dropout Fig.  2 . Illustration of Spatial Dropout. reasons: 1) Pooling layers, during downsampling, may result in the loss of certain original feature information, potentially leading to the omission of emotion-relevant details and thus impacting emotion recognition performance. 2) Emotional information might not solely depend on localized acoustic features but could also correlate with the distribution and temporal aspects of the entire signal. Incorporating spatial dropout layers can maintain positional invariance to some extent, enhancing the model's adaptability and capacity to better capture emotion-relevant information. Subsequent experiments also indicated the superiority of SD layers over pooling layers, with specific details presented in the results section. Finally, the features extracted from each pathway are concatenated and input into the SE layer.\n\nSqueeze-and-Excitation Module. We introduce the classic SE module into the model to perform weighted adjustments on feature channels, enhancing the effectiveness of multiscale features. The SE module aims to adaptively learn relationships between feature channels to better capture critical information. Specifically, we utilize the SE module to apply importance weighting to multi-scale features, strengthening those relevant to emotion recognition. The formula for the SE module is as follows:\n\nIn this formula, 𝛿 represents the ReLU function, 𝜎 represents the sigmoid function,\n\nare two fully connected matrices, and r is the number of intermediate hidden nodes. After obtaining the gated unit s, the final output X can be computed by:\n\n(2)",

The detailed network architecture of TIM-Net is illustrated in Bodypart II of Fig.  1 . It is a bidirectional network comprising different time-aware blocks, and as the forward structure is the same as the backward, we will briefly introduce the forward structure of this network. TIM-Net employs TAB(T ) for the selection of temporal features. Each of T consists of two sub-blocks and a sigmoid function 𝜎(•) to learn temporal attention maps A, so as to generate time-aware features 𝑭 through input and A. For the two identical sub-blocks of the 𝑗-th T 𝑗 , each sub-block starts by adding a DC Conv with the exponentially increasing dilated rate 2 𝑗 -1 and causal constraint. The DC Conv is then followed by a batch normalization, a ReLU function, and a spatial dropout. The input ì 𝑭 𝑗 for each ì T 𝑗+1 is derived from the previous TAB, as shown in the Eq.
