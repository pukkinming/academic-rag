This paper presents a comparative analysis of state-of-the-art Pretrained Language Models (PTMs) for fine-grained emotion classification on two benchmark datasets from GitHub and Stack Overflow. We evaluate six transformer models -BERT, RoBERTa, ALBERT, DeBERTa, CodeBERT and GraphCodeBERT against the current best-performing tool SEntiMoji. Our analysis reveals consistent improvements ranging from 1.17% to 16.79% in terms of macroaveraged and micro-averaged F1 scores, with general domain models outperforming specialized ones. To further enhance PTMs, we incorporate polarity features in attention layer during training, demonstrating additional average gains of 1.0% to 10.23% over baseline PTMs approaches. Our work provides strong evidence for the advancements afforded by PTMs in recognizing nuanced emotions like Anger, Love, Fear, Joy, Sadness, and Surprise in software engineering contexts. Through comprehensive benchmarking and error analysis, we also outline scope for improvements to address contextual gaps.",

      "text": "The exploration of emotion classification in software engineering (SE) texts has garnered considerable attention in recent years  [1, 2] , leading to the development of various emotion classification tools by researchers. Notable among these are ESEM-E by Murgia et al.  [3] , EMTk by Calefato et al.  [4] , and SEntiMoji by Chen et al.  [5] . Chen et al. 's comparative study, utilizing emotion datasets extracted from Stack Overflow and JIRA  [6, 7] , affirmed the superior performance of SEntiMoji compared to EMTk and ESEM-E, solidifying its prominence in the domain. However, compared to open-domain, Pre-Trained Language Models (PTMs) rarely have been used in software engineering text for emotion classification.\n\nA recent study by Li et al.  [8]  introduced the use of BERT  [9]  as part of a two-stage framework for ambiguity detection, surpassing the performance of SEntiMoji in a GitHub emotion dataset curated by Imran et al.  [10] . Another recent study by Bleyl et al.  [11]  found that BERT outperforms EMTk on Stack Overflow dataset curated by Novielli et al.  [7] . This shift towards leveraging PTMs prompts a critical inquiry into the overall efficacy of such models in the nuanced task of emotion classification within software engineering contexts. Notably, Pre-trained Transformer Language Models like BERT  [9]  and RoBERTa  [12]  have already demonstrated state-of-theart results across various software engineering domains, including code completion, code review, bug localization, sentiment analysis, and toxicity detection  [13] [14] [15] [16] [17] [18] [19] .\n\nIn light of these developments, this paper embarks on a comprehensive exploration of Pre-trained Transformers Language Models in emotion classification for software engineering texts. Through rigorous evaluation and comparison, we aim to shed light on the strengths, limitations, and potential implications of leveraging PTMs in this nuanced domain.\n\nOur study utilizes two distinct datasets sourced from GitHub by Imran et al.  [10]  and Stack Overflow by Novielli et al.  [7] , encompassing a diverse range of emotions expressed in software engineering contexts. We assess the effectiveness of six state-of-the-art PTMs, including four general domain models (BERT, RoBERTa, ALBERT and DeBERTa) and two specifically tailored for software engineering (CodeBERT and GraphCodeBERT). This evaluation is conducted against the benchmark set by the SEntiMoji model. EMTk and ESEM-E are excluded from this comparative analysis, aligning with findings reported by Chen et al.  [5]  indicating the superior performance of SEntiMoji.\n\nOur investigation is guided by two primary research questions, each addressing specific facets of PTMs for emotion classification: RQ1: How accurately can Pre-Trained Language Models classify emotions in software engineering texts compared to state-of-the-art model? To address this question, we evaluate the performance of the six aforementioned state-of-the-art PTMs against the SEntiMoji model. Utilizing two distinct datasets, the GitHub dataset by Imran et al.  [10]  and the Stack Overflow dataset by Novielli et al.  [7] , both annotated using the comprehensive model by Shaver et al.  [20] , we scrutinize the models' efficacy in capturing the nuances of emotions expressed in software engineering contexts. Our results suggest that the PTMs generally outperform state-of-the-art, average f1-score improvement ranges from 1.17% to 16.79%.",

We incorporate polarity features in attention layer of the PTMs. Our results suggest that they, indeed, improve the baseline PTMs further 1.0% to 10.23% in average f1-score metric.\n\nThe main contributions of this work are as follows:\n\n• To our best knowledge, this is the first study which leverages various PTMs for a large-scale comparative study against existing state-of-the-art tool for emotion classification in software engineering text. • This is the first study which leverages polarity features to enhance PTMs for emotion classification in software engineering text.\n\nWe release the source code at URL: https://anonymous.4open. science/status/SE_Emotion_PTM-3589.",

Previous research shows that BERT, RoBERTa and ALBERT work well in SE affect analysis  [17, 22] , while DeBERTa shows promising results in sentiment analysis  [23] . In addition to these four models, we compare against 2 domain-specific models that are widely used and proposed by Microsoft: CodeBERT and GraphCodeBERT -which showed promising results in various SE tasks  [24, 25] . The models are explained below. BERT  [9] : Introduced by Google in 2018, BERT, pre-trained on a diverse corpus, including Wikipedia and Book Corpus, revolutionized natural language processing NLP with its bidirectional transformer architecture. This design allows BERT to capture context from both left and right contexts of a given word, making it highly effective for a diverse range of NLP tasks. RoBERTa  [12] : Developed by Meta AI, RoBERTa represents a refinement in transformer-based models. By modifying key hyperparameters and leveraging an extensive training dataset, RoBERTa enhances its performance on benchmark NLP tasks, showcasing improved language representation understanding. DeBERTa  [26] : An evolution of BERT and developed by Microsoft Research, DeBERTa focuses on enhancing the decoding process in language understanding tasks. It incorporates directional masks ALBERT  [27] : Designed by Google Research, ALBERT introduces efficiency improvements to the BERT architecture without compromising representational power. This is achieved through parameter reduction techniques during training, showcasing resource-efficient yet highly effective language representations. CodeBERT  [28] : Tailored for programming languages and code understanding, CodeBERT, developed by Microsoft Research, is pre-trained on a large-scale dataset of programming tasks. This specialization allows CodeBERT to excel in source code-related tasks such as code summarization and variable naming. GraphCodeBERT  [29] : Developed by Microsoft Research, Graph-CodeBERT is a transformer-based model designed for comprehending programming languages and code. Pre-trained on a vast dataset of programming tasks, it effectively captures the complex structures and semantics of code, serving as a proficient solution for source code-related tasks.\n\nWe use the publicly available versions of each model in Hugging Face  [30] .

Due to space constraints, we focus exclusively on the GitHub benchmark which has gone prior error analysis  [10] . To understand where the PTMs commonly make mistake, we examine 67 cases where all six models agreed, yet the ground truth differed (9 false positives, 58 false negatives), distributed across emotions.\n\nFor assessment, we employ Novielli et al. 's  [33]  error categorization, using a thematic approach. An author initially mapped errors, and a senior undergraduate student reviewed and resolved disagreements through discussion. Echoing Imran et al. 's observations  [10] , the prevalent categories are 'General Error' and 'Implicit Sentiment Polarity.' General errors, occurring 29/67 times, manifest when models misinterpret or struggle to comprehend lexical cues conveying emotions. For instance, the text \"Nice, this is more slick thumbs-up\" is annotated as Joy. Another example, \"i'm actually surprised this didn't get flagged by the analyzer..., \" annotated as Surprise, remains mispredicted by all models. The majority of Surprise (10/15), Joy (8/14), and Love (4/5) errors fall into the general errors category.\n\nImplicit sentiment polarity errors occur 18/67 times. An example -\"Patiently waiting for any updates. [...]\" -is annotated as Sadness, with none of the models predicting it correctly. This category is particularly noticeable in Joy (6/14) and Sadness (5/11).\n\nThe third major error category is 'Figurative Language' (9/67), which occurs when users use humor, sarcasm, metaphors, etc to convey emotion. This category is noticeable among negative emotions (Anger 5/13 and Fear 3/9). For example, the following utterance \"[...] I understand what you mean by \"takeover\" however it doesn't hurt to be a little more explicit.\" -annotated as Anger but none of the models were able to detect it correctly.\n\nOf note, in 13/67 cases, the utterances contain emojis which contribute in expressing emotions. The models possibly fail to capture them. For instance, \"And yes, there should be tests facescreaming-in-fear face-screaming-in-fear face-screaming-in-fear\"annotated as Fear, none of the models predict it accurately.\n\nRQ1 Takeaway: The transformer-based PTMs consistently outperform the state-of-the-art SEntiMoji model across all emotions for both datasets. DeBERTa and RoBERTa emerge as top performers. General PTMs outshine domain-specific ones in this context.",

We aim to explore its applicability to emotion classification within the SE domain.  to extract word polarity. This involves a series of steps such as tokenization, part-of-speech tagging, and identification of words with discernible sentiment, resulting in a concise list of polarity words for each utterance. Subsequently, the model architecture is fine-tuned at the attention level, with a focus on polarity words. Attention weights are adjusted to assign greater significance to tokens linked with polarity words. This involves a strategic blending of attention weights related to the primary input text and those corresponding to polarity words. The adjustment ensures a heightened emphasis on the embeddings of polarity words, achieved by multiplying attention weights for primary input text's hidden states by 0.75 and those for polarity words' hidden states by 0.25, followed by concatenation. This modification enhances the model's sensitivity to sentiment-carrying terms during training, allowing for improved discernment of subtle variations in sentiment expression.

      "text": ". The results of emotion classification using polarity-enhanced PTMs are presented in Table  3 , along with the percentage difference in performance against a state-of-theart model and baseline PTMs. The findings show that polarityenhanced PTMs outperform the state-of-the-art SEntiMoji model and baseline PTMs. GitHub Dataset: SEntiMoji baseline: DeBERTa achieves the highest micro-averaged F1-score of 0.620, showing a 17.09% improvement. On the macro-averaged F1-score metric, BERT achieves the highest score of 0.621, reflecting a 19.28% improvement. Analyzing individual emotions, polarity-enhanced PTMs outperform SEnti-Moji 33 out of 36 times, with improvements in Anger, Love, Fear, and Surprise for all six models, Joy for five models, and Sadness for four models. Anger achieves the highest F1-score of 0.588 by DeBERTa, marking a 27.88% improvement from SEntiMoji, Love F1-score 0.787 by RoBERTa (+22.63%), Fear F1-score 0.583 by BERT (+54.58%), Joy F1-score 0.633 by BERT (+13.85%), Sadness F1-score 0.674 by BERT (+7.07%), and Surprise F1-score 0.661 by BERT (+44.19%). PTM baseline: The improvement on PTM baseline ranges from 2.52% to 9.16% on micro-averaged F1-score and from 1.04% to 8.37% on macro-averaged F1-score. The most improved PTM is ALBERT in both micro and macro-averaged F1-score. enhancement is observed consistently across individual emotions, with Joy and Sadness improving for all six models, Anger and Fear for five models, Love for four models, and Surprise for four models. Noteworthy improvements include a 26.61% enhancement in Anger by CodeBERT, a 5.80% improvement in Love by CodeBERT, a 25.37% improvement in Fear by ALBERT, a 31.19% improvement in Joy by ALBERT, an 8.47% improvement in Sadness by GraphCodeBERT, and a 17.04% improvement in Surprise by RoBERTa. Stack Overflow Dataset: SEntiMoji baseline: RoBERTa achieves the highest micro-averaged F1-score of 0.766, showing a 7.36% improvement; as well as and the highest-averaged F1-score of 0.646, reflecting a 21.93% improvement. Analyzing individual emotions, polarity-enhanced PTMs outperform SEntiMoji 33 out of 36 times, with improvements in Love, Fear, Joy, and Sadness for all six models, Anger for five models, and Surprise for four models. Anger achieved the highest F1-score of 0.777 by RoBERTa and ALBERT, marking a 2.44% improvement from SEntiMoji, Love F1-score 0.880 by RoBERTa (+7.47%), Fear F1-score 0.667 by ALBERT (+55.56%), Joy F1-score 0.643 by DeBERTa (+47.74%), Sadness F1-score 0.664 by BERT (+16.0%), and Surprise F1-score 0.400 by BERT (+120.0%).\n\nPTM baseline: The improvement on PTM baseline ranges from 1.0% to 1.91% on micro-averaged F1-score and from 3.11% to 10.23% on macro-averaged F1-score. The most improved PTM is ALBERT in macro-averaged F1-score metric and CodeBERT in macro-averaged F1-score metric. While the improvement in Stack Overflow dataset against baseline PTMs is less compared to the GitHub dataset, this enhancement is observed consistently across individual emotions, with Surprise improving for all six models, Love, Fear and Joy for five models, Sadness for four models, and Anger for four models. Noteworthy improvements include a 2.04% enhancement in Anger by ALBERT, a 1.47% improvement in Love by GraphCodeBERT, a 15.15% improvement in Fear by ALBERT, a 6.53% improvement in Joy by DeBERTa, an 18.15% improvement in Sadness by ALBERT, and a 140.0% improvement in Surprise by RoBERTa.\n\nThe average PTM improvement in both dataset are similar to the general domain sentiment analysis results  [34, 35] .\n\nError Analysis: Similar to RQ1, we look into GitHub dataset for this case as well. In RQ1 error analysis, we observe that in 67 cases all models predict incorrectly. Out of those 67 cases, we find that 40 cases still produce erroneous results. However, in rest 27 cases, at least one model predict correctly. The most prominent resolved error categories are: 13/29 (44.82%) general errors, 9/18 (50%) implicit sentiment polarity, and 2/3 politeness. For example, \"i'm actually surprised this didn't get flagged by the analyzer..., \" -this utterance is now correctly predicted by CodeBERT.\n\nThe least improved error category is 'Pragmatics'. Pragmatics is the error category when the classifiers deal with context information. That is often human annotators consider external facts for annotation. example, consider the following utterance, \"[...] This change makes it the same as the line above and I don't see any reason to have two lines that are showing the same thing. \" -is annotated as Anger as the commentator is annoyed/disagreed with the change in code. 6/7 (85.71%) Pragmatics related errors remains unresolved. Another least improved error category is 'Figurative Language' -6/9 (66%) utterances predictions remained unchanged. For example, this following utterance, \"[...] We need to add this test coverage. It's just not 'urgent'. neutral-face\" -which expresses sarcasm and annotated as Anger. The models predict it incorrectly.\n\nWe observe that there still remains a considerable amount of utterances (10/13) that are misclassified contain emojis. For example, the previously mentioned utterance, \"And yes, there should be tests face-screaming-in-fear face-screaming-in-fear face-screamingin-fear\" -all models still predict incorrectly.\n\nRQ2 Takeaway: Polarity-enhanced PTMs consistently outperform the SEntiMoji model and baseline PTMs in both datasets. Notable improvements are seen in micro-and macro-averaged along with substantial enhancements for individual metric across various models. While the findings indicate that integrating sentiment polarity improves PTM performance, it do not always help to capture context-dependent emotions.",

This suggests that the pre-training objectives and textual domains carry greater relevance than task-specific tuning in the emotion classification task within SE text.\n\nSecondly, the incorporation of polarity features during finetuning consistently enhances performance, emphasizing the value of sentiment awareness. However, challenges persist, especially with negative emotions like Anger and Fear, which pose difficulties in context understanding.\n\nThirdly, no single model excels across all emotions in all metrics, necessitating careful benchmarking and tradeoff analysis. Common error categories, such as implicit polarity, figurative language, and pragmatics, underscore the challenges in understanding contextual gaps in nuanced emotion recognition. Addressing these complexities requires further customization. For example, Imran et al.  [37]  addressed the issue of understanding figurative language in SE text using contrastive learning.\n\nLastly, persistent challenges arise in handling emojis, as models struggle to interpret emotive signals. Incorporating dedicated approaches to handle emojis may offer mitigation strategies.",

Recognizing that emotion classification often treats each category separately, a hierarchical framework may enhance performance by first identifying broad emotional valence (positive, negative, or neutral) before classifying specific categories, as demonstrated by Li et al.  [8] .\n\nIn SE-specific models, exploring pre-training with polarity-word masking, emojis, and emoticons atop general word masking is warranted, given promising results in the general domain for sentiment analysis  [38] . Research also suggests that aspect-based sentiment analysis (ABSA)-enhanced PTMs outperform baseline PTMs  [35, 39] . As polarity-enhanced PTMs have already shown superiority over baseline PTMs, exploring ABSA-enhanced PTMs may further improve classifiers.\n\nAdditionally, investigating the multi-modal fusion of text and emojis cues during the pre-training/fine-tuning step could enhance the interpretation of emotive expressions. Exploring generative language models like GPT-4 and LLaMA for emotion detection using zero-shot and few-shot learning presents an intriguing direction. Recent advancements in these models enable synthesizing natural language responses, facilitating data augmentation and prompting techniques for improved classification  [40] [41] [42] [43] . Focusing on detecting the most relevant emotions that may harm productivity, such as Frustration and Disappointment, holds merit  [44] .

Construct validity assesses how well the study measures the concepts and constructs it aims to evaluate. While potential issues may arise from manually annotating the error analysis in RQ1, we mitigated this by employing thematic analysis to address any possible problems. Internal validity. Internal validity focuses on the extent to which the study's findings can be attributed to the manipulation of the independent variable. Threats may arise from mistakes in our experiments, but we have provided a replication package and outputs for independent verifications. Another potential threat is the absence of cross-validation on smaller datasets, which we addressed by using stratified sampling for representativeness and an 80%-20% train-test split. There's also a potential threat related to data leakage in SEntiMoji models against the GitHub benchmark dataset, but this is unlikely as SEntiMoji was pre-trained before 2019  [5] , and data points of the GitHub dataset came afterward  [10] . However, verification of this is beyond the scope of our study given that not all pre-trained data is released by the authors  [5] . External validity. External validity concerns the generalization of our study's findings to other settings and contexts. Our results may not extend beyond the specific models, datasets, and domains of GitHub and Stack Overflow. However, we utilized diverse pretrained models and the most comprehensive datasets available in this field. Further investigation is necessary to validate our results beyond the datasets and pre-trained models used in our study.",

Through evaluation on two datasets, sourced from GitHub and Stack Overflow and annotated using Shaver's emotion model, we address two key research questions. First, we examined the accuracy of PTMs in classifying emotions compared to SEntiMoji, we found consistent enhancements with models like BERT, DeBERTa and RoBERTa achieving upto 16.79% improvements in terms of macro and micro-averaged F1 scores. The results showcase the prowess of general domain PTMs, with domain specific CodeBERT and GraphCodeBERT underperforming. Analysis of common errors revealed struggles in handling general comprehension, implicit polarity, figurative language and contextual pragmatics. Next, we incorporated polarity features during PTM finetuning and demonstrated additional gains over both SEntiMoji and baseline PTMs. This validates the benefit of augmenting with explicit polarity information for nuanced emotion classification. However, errors linked to figurative language and pragmatics persisted. In conclusion, this study provides a robust benchmark of diverse PTMs in a complex affective analysis task within software engineering, showcasing their effectiveness not only in sentiment analysis but also in fine-grained emotion recognition. These findings underscore the potential of PTMs in advancing empathetic software intelligence, with opportunities for further refinement to address contextual gaps.",
