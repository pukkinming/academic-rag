      "text": "The Multimodal Sentiment Analysis Challenge (MuSe) 2022 is dedicated to multimodal sentiment and emotion recognition. For this year's challenge, we feature three datasets: (i) the Passau Spontaneous Football Coach Humor (Passau-SFCH) dataset that contains audio-visual recordings of German football coaches, labelled for the presence of humour; (ii) the Hume-Reaction dataset in which reactions of individuals to emotional stimuli have been annotated with respect to seven emotional expression intensities, and (iii) the Ulm-Trier Social Stress Test (Ulm-TSST) dataset comprising of audio-visual data labelled with continuous emotion values (arousal and valence) of people in stressful dispositions. Using the introduced datasets, MuSe 2022 addresses three contemporary affective computing problems: in the Humor Detection Sub-Challenge (MuSe-Humor), spontaneous humour has to be recognised; in the Emotional Reactions Sub-Challenge (MuSe-Reaction), seven fine-grained 'in-the-wild' emotions have to be predicted; and in the Emotional Stress Sub-Challenge (MuSe-Stress), a continuous prediction of stressed emotion values is featured. The challenge is designed to attract different research communities, encouraging a fusion of their disciplines. Mainly, MuSe 2022 targets the communities of audio-visual emotion recognition, health informatics, and symbolic sentiment analysis. This baseline paper describes the datasets as well as the feature sets extracted from them. A recurrent neural network with LSTM cells is used to set competitive baseline results on the test partitions for each sub-challenge. We",

      "text": "The 3rd edition of the Multimodal Sentiment Analysis (MuSe) Challenge addresses three tasks: humour detection and categorical as well as dimensional emotion recognition. Each corresponding sub-challenge utilises a different dataset. In the Humor Detection Sub-Challenge (MuSe-Humor), participants will detect the presence of humour in football press conference recordings. For MuSe-Humor, the novel Passau Spontaneous Football Coach Humor (Passau-SFCH) dataset is introduced. It features press conference recordings of 10 German Bundesliga football coaches, recorded between August 2017 and November 2017. Initially, the dataset comprises about 18 hours of video, where each of the 10 coaches accounts for at least 90 minutes of data. The subset provided in the challenge still features 11 hours of video. Originally, the data is annotated for direction as well as sentiment of humour following the two-dimensional model of humour proposed in  [36] . In the challenge, only the presence of humour is to be predicted.\n\nFor the Emotional Reactions Sub-Challenge (MuSe-Reaction), emotional reactions are explored by introducing a first of its kind, large-scale (2,222 subjects, 70+ hours), multi-modal (audio and video) dataset: Hume-Reaction . The data was gathered in the wild, with subjects recording their own facial and vocal reactions to a wide range of emotionally evocative videos via their webcam, in a wide variety of at-home recording settings with varying noise conditions. Subjects selected the emotions they experienced in response to each video out of 48 provided categories and rated each selected emotion on a 0-100 intensity scale. In this sub-challenge, participants will apply a multi-output regression to predict the intensities of seven self-reported emotions from the subjects' multi-modal recorded responses: Adoration, Amusement, Anxiety, Disgust, Empathic Pain, Fear, Surprise .\n\nThe Emotional Stress Sub-Challenge (MuSe-Stress) is a regression task on continuous signals for valence and arousal. It is based on the Ulm-Trier Social Stress Test dataset (Ulm-TSST), comprising individuals in a stress-inducing scenario following the Trier Social Stress Test (TSST). This sub-challenge is motivated by the prevalence of stress and its harmful impacts in modern societies  [12] . In addition to audio, video and textual features, Ulm-TSST includes four biological signals captured at a sampling rate of 1 kHz; EDA, Electrocardiogram (ECG), Respiration (RESP), and heart rate (BPM). MuSe-Stress was already part of MuSe 2021  [42] , where it attracted considerable interest. Due to some participants reporting challenges generalising to the test set  [20, 27] , we rerun the challenge, allowing participants to submit more predictions than in the previous iteration. We thereby hope to encourage participants to thoroughly explore the robustness of their proposed approaches. Moreover, for this year's MuSe-Stress sub-challenge, we use the labels of last year's MuSe-Physio sub-challenge as the arousal gold standard.\n\nBy providing the mentioned tasks in the 2022 edition of MuSe, we aim for addressing research questions that are of interest to affective computing, machine learning and multimodal signal processing communities and encourage a fusion of their disciplines. Further, we hope that our multimodal challenge can yield new insights into the merits of each of the core modalities, as well as various multimodal fusion approaches. Participants are allowed to use the provided feature sets in the challenge packages and integrate them into their own machine learning frameworks.\n\nThe paper is structured as follows: Section 2 introduces the three sub-challenges alongside with the datasets they are based on, and outlines the challenge protocol. Then, pre-processing, provided features, their alignment, and our baseline models are described in Section 3. In Section 4, we present and discuss our baseline results before concluding the paper in Section 5.\n\nA summary of the challenge results can be found in  [1] .",

      "text": "Humour is one of the richest and most consequential elements of human behaviour and cognition  [25]  and thus of high relevance in the context of affective computing and human-computer interaction. As humour can be expressed both verbally and non-verbally, multimodal approaches are especially suited for detecting humour. However, while humour detection is a very active field of research in Natural Language Processing (e. g.,  [16, 52] ), only a few multimodal datasets for humour detection exist  [28, 38, 51] . Especially, to the best of our knowledge, there are no datasets for detecting humour in spontaneous, non-staged situations. With MuSe-Humor, we intend to address this research gap.\n\nIn this challenge, the Passau-SFCH dataset is utilised. It features video and audio recordings of press conferences of 10 German Bundesliga football coaches, during which the coaches occasionally express humour. The press conferences present natural, live, semistaged communication of the coaches to and with journalists in the audience. All subjects are male and aged between 30 and 53 years. The dataset is split into speaker independent partitions. The training set includes the videos of 4 coaches, while the development and test partition both comprise the videos of 3 coaches. We only include segments in which the coach is speaking to ensure that humour is detected from the behaviour of the coach and not the audience, e. g., laughter. Participants are provided with video, audio, and ASR transcripts of said segments. To obtain the transcripts, we utilise a Wav2Vec2-Large-XLSR  [17]  model fine-tuned on the German data in Common Voice  [6]   1  . Moreover, manually corrected transcripts are included.\n\nEvery video was originally labelled by 9 annotators at a 2 Hz rate indicating sentiment and direction of the humour expressed, as defined by the two-dimensional humour model proposed by Martin et al.  [36]  in the Humor Style Questionnaire (HSQ). For the challenge, we only build upon binary humour labels, i. e., indicating if the coach's communication is humorous or not. We obtain a binary label referring to presence or absence of humour using the following three steps. First, we only consider the humour dimension label of sentiment. Second, based on the sentiment labels, we filter out annotators displaying low agreement with other annotators. In order to account for slight lags in annotation signals, we choose to compute the target humour labels for frames of two seconds using a step size of one second. Finally, such a frame is considered as containing humour if at least 3 of the remaining annotators indicate humour within this frame. As a result, 4.9 % of the training partition frames, 2.9 % of the development partition frames, and 3.9 % of the test partition frames are labelled as humorous. We deliberately opted for a split in which the humour label is over-represented in the training partition in order to help participants' models with learning. The provided features are extracted at 2 Hz rates. They can easily be mapped to the 2 s segments they belong to.\n\nFor evaluation, the AUC metric is utilised, indicating how well a model can separate humorous from non-humorous frames.",

      "text": "Computational approaches for understanding human emotional reactions are of growing interest to researchers  [32, 46] , with emerging applications ranging from pedagogy  [15]  to medicine  [41] . A person's reaction to a given stimulus can be informative about both the stimulus itself, e. g., whether educational material is interesting to a given audience, and about the person, e. g., their level of empathy  [48]  and well-being  [57] . However, progress in developing computational approaches to understand human emotional reactions has been hampered by the limited availability of large-scale datasets of spontaneous emotional reactions. Thus, for the MuSe-Reaction sub-challenge, we introduce the Hume-Reaction (Hume-Reaction) dataset, which consists of more than 70 hours of audio and video data, from 2,222 subjects from the United States  (1, 138)  and South Africa (1,084), aged from 18.5 -49.0 years old.\n\nThe subjects within the dataset are reacting to a wide range of emotionally evocative stimuli (2,185 stimuli in total  [18] ). Each sample within the dataset has been self-annotated by the subjects themselves for the intensity of 7 emotional expressions in a range from 1-100: Adoration, Amusement, Anxiety, Disgust, Empathic Pain, Fear, Surprise.\n\nThe data is self-recorded via subjects' own webcams in an environment of their choosing, including a wide variety of background, noise, and lighting conditions. Furthermore, different subjects spontaneously reacted with their faces and voices to varying degrees, such that the audio and multi-modal aspects of this sub-challenge will be particularly interesting to incorporate. The organisers also provide labels for detected (energy-based) vocalisations to aid participants in incorporating audio, with a total of 8,064 multi-modal recordings found to include vocalisations.\n\nFor the MuSe-Reaction sub-challenge the aim is to perform a multi-output regression from features extracted from the multimodal (audio and video) data for the intensity of 7 emotional reaction classes. For this sub-challenge's evaluation, the Pearson's correlations coefficient (𝜌) is reported as the primary baseline.",

      "text": "The MuSe-Stress task is based on the multimodal Ulm-TSST database, for which subjects were recorded in a stress-inducing, free speech scenario, following the TSST protocol  [31] . In the TSST, a job interview situation is simulated. Following a short period of preparation, a five-minute free speech oral presentation is given by the subjects. This presentation is supervised by two interviewers, who do not communicate with the subjects during the five minutes. Ulm-TSST comprises recordings of such TSST presentations of 69 participants (49 of them female), aged between 18 and 39 years. Overall, Ulm-TSST includes about 6 hours of data (cf. Table  1 ). On the one hand, the dataset features the audio, video, and text modalities. On the other hand, the physiological signals ECG, RESP, and BPM are provided. For extensive experiments on multimodal emotion recognition in TSST-based multimodal datasets see  [9] .\n\nUlm-TSST has been annotated by three raters continuously for the emotional dimensions of valence and arousal, at a 2 Hz sampling rate. Regarding valence, a gold standard is created by fusing the three corresponding annotator ratings, utilising the Rater Aligned Annotation Weighting (RAAW) method from the MuSe-Toolbox  [45] . RAAW addresses the difficulties arising when emotion annotations -subjective in their nature -are to be combined into a gold standard signal. In short, RAAW first tackles the inherent rater lag by aligning the (per annotator) standardised signals via generalised Canonical Time Warping (CTW)  [56] . After that, the Evaluator Weighted Estimator (EWE)  [26]  is applied to the aligned signals. EWE fuses the individual signals using a weighting based on each rater's inter-rater agreement to the mean of all others. A detailed description of RAAW can be found in  [45] . We obtain a mean inter-rater agreement of 0.204 (± 0.200) for valence.\n\nAs for the arousal gold standard, a different approach is employed. Instead of fusing the three annotators' arousal ratings, we take the labels of last year's MuSe-Physio sub-challenge as the arousal gold standard. Here, the annotator with lowest inter-rater agreement is discarded and replaced with the subject's electrodermal activity signal (EDA) which is known to indicate emotional arousal  [14] . This signal is downsampled to 2 Hz and smoothed using a Savitzky-Golay filtering approach (window size of 26 steps) in advance. Then, the two remaining annotators and the preprocessed EDA signal are again fused via RAAW, resulting in a mean inter annotator agreement of 0.233 (±0.289). This signal is called physiological arousal in the following. The motivation to employ this kind of gold standard is to obtain a more objective arousal signal. Considering such an objective criterion for arousal in addition to subjective annotations is especially relevant given the task at hand: in the job interview setting, individuals can be expected to try to hide their arousal, making it more difficult for annotators to recognise it. Detailed experiments on combining subjective annotations with objective physiological signals are provided in  [8] .\n\nUlm-TSST is split into train, development, and test partitions containing 41, 14, and 14 videos, respectively. The split is identical to the split used in last year's challenge. Figure  1  shows the distributions of the valence and physiological arousal signals for the dataset.",

For MuSe-Reaction -as can be seen in Table  1  -, a 60-20-20% split strategy is applied. There is no additional segmentation applied to clean the data further, each sample contains a single reaction to an emotional stimulus, and labels were normalised per sample to range from [0 :1]. For further exploration, the participants are also provided with voice activity segments from the samples, which show to contain audio of substantial energy. In the Ulm-TSST dataset, we make sure to exclude scenes which are not a part of the TSST setting, e. g., the instructor speaking.

In MuSe-Humor, we use the default configuration to extract the 88 eGeMAPS functionals for each two second audio frame. For the audio of MuSe-Reaction, the 88 eGeMAPS functionals are extracted with a step size of 100 ms and window size of 1 second.

In the videos of MuSe-Humor, typically more than one face is visible.

Two steps are carried out to filter extracted faces that do not show the coach in Passau-SFCH: first, we automatically detect the respective coach's faces using FaceNet 8 embeddings of reference pictures showing the coach. The results of this procedure are then corrected manually. Ulm-TSST, in contrast, has a simple, static setting. The camera position is fixed and videos only show the TSST subjects who typically do not move much. Similarly, for MuSe-Reaction, the video is captured from a fixed webcam. Hence, the performance of MTCNN is almost flawless for both Hume-Reaction and Ulm-TSST. The extracted faces then serve as inputs of the feature extractors VGGface 2 and Py-Feat .",

We sample the visual features with a rate of 2 Hz in all sub-challenges. The only exception is the FAUs in MuSe-Reaction, which are sampled at a 4 Hz rate. Regarding the audio features (DeepSpectrum and eGeMAPS), we apply the same frequency in MuSe-Humor and MuSe-Stress, while eGeMAPS features are obtained using a step size of 100 ms in MuSe-Reaction. As VGGish and FAUs are only meaningful if the respective frame actually includes a face, we impute frames without a face with zeros.\n\nFor MuSe-Humor, the binary humour label refers to frames of at most 2 seconds length. Hence, each label in MuSe-Humor corresponds to at most 4 facial and acoustic feature vectors. 2 Hz sentence embedding vectors are constructed by assigning every sentence to the 500 ms frames it corresponds to. If two sentences fall into the same frame, their embeddings are averaged to form the feature for that frame.\n\nRegarding MuSe-Reaction, there is no alignment needed with labels, as each file is associated to a single vector of 7 emotional reaction labels.\n\nFor the MuSe-Stress sub-challenge, we provide label-aligned features. Hence, these features exactly align with the labels. We apply zero-padding to the frames, where the feature type is absent. Moreover, we downsample the biosignals in Ulm-TSST to 2 Hz, followed by a smoothing utilising a Savitzky-Golay filter. Participants are provided with both the raw signals and the downsampled ones.\n\nIn both Ulm-TSST and Passau-SFCH, manual transcripts are available. However, they lack timestamps. Hence, we reconstruct word level timestamps utilising the Montreal Forced Aligner (MFA)  [37]  tool. Here, we employ the German (Prosodylab) model and the German Prosodylab dictionary. The text features are then aligned to the 2 Hz label signal by repeating each word embedding throughout the determined interval of the corresponding word. In case a 500 ms frame comprises more than one word, we average over the word embeddings. Zero imputing is applied to parts where subjects do not speak. For the sentence embeddings in Passau-SFCH we choose an analogous approach, repeating and, if applicable, averaging the embeddings.",

More specifically, we employ a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM)-RNN. Initially, we train a single model on each of the available feature sets. Regarding MuSe-Stress, we separately train a model for both labels, valence and physiological arousal. We conduct an extensive hyperparameter search for each prediction target and feature. We thus optimise the number of RNN layers, the dimensionality of the LSTM's hidden vectors and the learning rate. Of note, we also experiment with both unidirectional and bidirectional LSTMs. The code as well as the configurations found in the hyperparameter search are available in the baseline GitHub repository 12 .\n\nEach label in MuSe-Humor is predicted based on all feature vectors belonging to the corresponding 2 s window. Hence, the sequence length in the MuSe-Humor training process is at most 4 steps.\n\nIn both MuSe-Reaction and MuSe-Stress, we make use of a segmentation approach which showed to improve results in previous works  [43, 44, 47] . We find that a segmentation of the training data with a window size of 50 s (i. e., 200 steps) and a hop size of 25 s (i.e., 100 steps) leads to good results for MuSe-Stress. For MuSe-Reaction a slightly larger size of 500 steps and a hop size of 250, lead to more robust results.\n\nFollowing the unimodal experiments, in order to combine different modalities, for MuSe-Humor and MuSe-Stress, we implement a simple late fusion approach. We apply the exact same training procedure as before, now treating the predictions of previously trained unimodal models as input features. In these experiments, we use one configuration per task, without performing a hyperparameter search for every possible modality combination in MuSe-Stress. As this approach for late fusion is less suited to a multi-label strategy, we apply an early fusion strategy for MuSe-Reaction. For early fusion, we simply concatenate the best performing feature sets for each modality (audio and video), and then train a new model with the same hyperparameters from the uni-modal experiments. The code and configuration for the two fusion methods are also part of the baseline GitHub repository 13 .

This comes as no surprise, given that the expression of humour is often accompanied by smile or laughter and thus recognisable from facial expressions features. A manual inspection of the humorous segments confirms this intuition. Nevertheless, audio features are able to detect humour, too. Partly, this may be due to the presence of laughter. The performance of text features (.7888 on the test set) is slightly worse than for the features 13 https://github.com/EIHW/MuSe2022 based on the video modality, but also better than the performance of the audio features. We find that the sentence-level BERT features outperform the token-level features. With the simple fusion of modalities, the performance is not improved. Specifically, the late fusion approach typically shows worse generalisation to the test data than the unimodal experiments. e. g., there is a discrepancy of about .16 between mean AUC on the development (.8219) and test (.6633) sets for the combination of audio and video.",

      "text": "Table  3  shows the results for the MuSe-Reaction baseline. As expected, the audio results are substantially lower than those from the video modality. Of particular note, as it pertains to audio, we see that the emotion-tailored feature-set of eGeMAPS performs poorly, almost 0.05 𝜌 lower on the development set than the DeepSpectrum features. Given that there is limited speech in the data set, this may be why the DeepSpectrum features perform better, as due to being spectrogram-based, they can potentially capture a more general acoustic scene and non-speech verbalisations potentially better.\n\nFor the video features, the FAUs are performing much better on the test set than VGGface 2 (although both are derived from faces), given the nature of the data being 'reactions', it may be that the facial action units are much more dynamic generally, and these features model more accurately the emotional expression occurring within the scene.\n\nInterestingly, when we observe the individual class scores, we see that Amusement is consistently performing better than all other classes, a finding which is consistent for audio and video features (eGeMAPS: .148 𝜌, and FAU: .405 𝜌). As well as being the most likely class to contain non-verbal communication e. g., laughter, this performance may be due to the known ease of modelling highly aroused states of emotional expression  [49] . However, it may also relate to the valence of the emotions as we can see from Figure  2 , the Disgust class is the worst performing for FAU.\n\nIt is worth noting that in this case, the early-fusion of the two best-performing feature sets in each modality does not yield any beneficial results. This holds, although we do consider that through the use of a knowledge-based audio approach, we may see more improvement for audio, which may result in stronger performance via fusion.",

      "text": "Table  4  reports the results obtained for MuSe-Stress. Consistent with results reported by some of last year's participants  [20, 27] , the results for MuSe-Stress partly fail to generalise to the test data. With respect to single modality experiments, this observation is particularly significant for the video features. For example, the best seed for predicting physiological arousal based on Facial Action Units yields a CCC of .5191 on the development set, but only results in a CCC of .0785 on the test partition. The audio feature sets, in comparison, achieve better generalisation with the most extreme difference between development and test CCC being about .12 (for eGeMAPS on physiological arousal). Moreover, for both prediction targets, the DeepSpectrum audio features perform best among the unimodal approaches with CCC values of .4239 and .4931 on the test sets for physiological arousal and valence, respectively.   3 . A surprising aspect of the unimodal results is that audio features yield better results for valence than for arousal, contrary to previous results in the domain of multimodal emotion recognition. For the visual features, no such tendency to work better for one of the two dimensions can be observed: FAUs lead to better results for predicting valence (mean CCC of .3878 on the test set) than for physiological arousal (.1135); the same is true for the VGGface 2 features (.1968 and .1576 mean CCC on the test set for valence and arousal, respectively). The textual BERT features account for higher CCCs on the development partition for valence (mean CCC of .3221) than for physiological arousal (.2828). Surprisingly, however, for arousal, they generalise better to the test data, while for valence, the mean BERT CCCs drops from .3221 to .1872 when evaluating on the test set. These partly counterintuitive results may be attributed to the job interview setting. Job interviewees typically suppress nervousness in an attempt to give a relaxed, sovereign impression. This might make the detection of arousal from audio and video difficult. The comparably stable performance of textual features for physiological arousal may be due to correlations between participants pausing their speech for a longer time -or hardly at all -and arousal. We find such correlations to exist for several participants.\n\nWe also experiment with the downsampled biosignals, motivated by some of last year's approaches (  [11, 34, 55] ) to the task which used these signals as a feature. To do so, we concatenate the three signals (BPM, ECG, and respiratory rate) into a three-dimensional feature vector and normalise them. Here, severe generalisation and stability problems can be observed. To give an example, for arousal, the mean CCC performance of biosignal features on the development set is .2793, but for the test set, it drops to .1095. What is more, the standard deviations obtained with the biosignal results are consistently higher than those of any other modality. Because of these issues and in order not to inflate the number of experiments, we exclude the physiological modality from the late fusion experiments.\n\nWhile valence prediction could not be improved by late fusion, the late fusion of the audio and text modality accounts for the best result on the test set for physiological arousal prediction (.4761 CCC), slightly surpassing the late fusion of audio and text (.4413) as well as DeepSpectrum (.4239). For valence, a generalisation issue for late fusion is apparent. To give an example, the late fusion of acoustic and visual features yields by far the best result on the development set (.6914) but only achieves a CCC of .4906 on the test set.",
