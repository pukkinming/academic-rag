      "text": "Multimodal emotion recognition plays an important role in humancomputer interaction. Recently, researchers have made significant progress in this field. However, this task is still not well solved and its performance still cannot meet the requirements of practical applications  [1] . To this end, last year, we launched MER2023  [2] , focusing on three important topics: multi-label learning, noise robustness, and semi-supervised learning. This year, we continue the latter two tracks and introduce a new track around open-vocabulary emotion recognition, aiming to describe emotional states accurately.\n\nFirst, it is hard to collect samples with emotion labels. On the one hand, the collected samples are often emotionless (i.e. neutral)  [3] . On the other hand, researchers usually hire multiple annotators and use majority voting to improve label consistency  [4] , greatly increasing the annotation cost. To address the sparsity of emotional data, previous works used unlabeled data and focused on unsupervised or semi-supervised learning. Recently, MERBench [1] has conducted a systematic analysis, pointing out the necessity of using unlabeled data from the same domain as labeled data. Therefore, we provide a large number of human-centric unlabeled videos in MER-SEMI and encourage participants to explore more effective unsupervised or semi-supervised strategies.\n\nSecondly, in real scenarios, we cannot ensure that every video is free of audio noise and every frame is in high resolution. To copy with complex environments, emotion recognition systems should have a certain degree of noise robustness. Therefore, we organize MER-NOISE to fairly evaluate the noise robustness of different systems. Although there are many types of noise, we only consider the two most common ones: audio additive noise and image blur noise. In this track, we encourage participants to use data augmentation  [5]  or other effective techniques  [6, 7]  to improve performance under noisy conditions.\n\nThirdly, to improve label consistency, existing datasets usually restrict the label space to a few discrete categories, then employ multiple annotators and use majority voting to select the most likely label. However, this process may cause some correct but non-candidate or non-majority labels to be ignored. Therefore, we introduce MER-OV, centered around open-vocabulary emotion recognition. We encourage participants to generate any number of labels in any category, trying to describe emotional states accurately.\n\nIn summary, MER2024 consists of three tracks: MER-SEMI, MER-NOISE, and MER-OV. In MER-SEMI, we encourage participants to use unlabeled data during training; in MER-NOISE, we focus on noise robustness; in MER-OV, we require participants to describe emotional states as accurately as possible. The MER series of challenges aims to provide participants with a common platform to fairly compare the performance of different techniques. In the rest of this paper, we will introduce the datasets, baselines, evaluation metrics, and experimental results in detail.",

      "text": "MER2024 is an extended version of MER2023  [2]  and its construction process is summarized in Figure  1 . Specifically, MER2023 contains four subsets: Train&Val, MER-MULTI, MER-NOISE, and MER-SEMI. In the last subset, in addition to the labeled data, it also contains a large amount of unlabeled data. In MER2024, we merge all labeled samples and obtain the updated Train&Val. Meanwhile, we collect more unlabeled data and select a subset for annotation, getting MER-SEMI and MER-NOISE. For MER-OV, we select 332 samples from Train&Val and provide open-vocabulary labels. Table  1  summarizes the statistics of these datasets.",

      "text": "As shown in Figure  1 , MER2024 expands the dataset size. Its data collection process is borrowed from MER2023 and includes two key steps: video cutting and video filtering.\n\nVideo Cutting. The raw data in MER2024 comes from movies and TV series, which are close to real scenarios. However, these videos are usually long and have many characters, so they need to be segmented into video clips. In this process, we require that the content in these video clips is relatively complete. For videos with subtitles, the timestamps in the subtitles provide accurate boundary information, and we use them for video segmentation. For videos without subtitles, we use the voice activity detection toolkit, Silero VAD  4  , to segment the video and the speaker identification toolkit, Deep Speaker 5  , to merge the consecutive clips if they are likely to be from the same speaker.\n\nVideo Filtering. Through the above process, we can generate video clips containing relatively complete content from the same speaker. However, it only guarantees that the audio is from the same person, but cannot guarantee that there is only one person in the visual frames. Therefore, we further filter these video clips. Specifically, we use the face detection toolkit, YuNet  6  , to ensure that most frames contain only one face. Then, we use the face recognition toolkit, face.evoLVe  7  , to ensure that these faces belong to the same person. Meanwhile, the length of video clips is also important. Video clips that are too short may not convey the complete meaning; video clips that are too long may contain emotional changes,",

      "section_name": "Mer-Semi And Mer-Noise",
      "text": "Annotating all unlabeled data requires a lot of labor costs. To reduce the cost, we only select samples with a high probability of explicit emotions. Specifically, we use the top-16 results in last year's challenge and calculate the proportion of primary labels as the basis for selection. For example, if a sample is predicted as happy 10 times and neutral 6 times, its score is 𝑣 = max(6, 10)/16. Then, taking into account the calculated score and class balance, we select a total of 6,000 samples for labeling. During the annotation process, we hire 5 annotators and only select samples in which at least 4 annotators assign the same label, resulting in 2,339 labeled samples. All these samples are equally divided into two parts, one for MER-SEMI and the other for MER-NOISE.\n\nFor MER-NOISE, we additionally add noise to videos. This paper considers two types of noise: audio additive noise and image blur noise. For the audio, we select noise from the MUSAN dataset  [32] , which contains three subsets: music, noise, and speech. The noise in the first two subsets may convey emotions and affect the emotion of the raw audio. For example, rain and thunder may lead to a negative sentiment, while a pleasant breeze may generate a positive sentiment. Therefore, we only use the noise in the last subset. Specifically, we randomly select a speech-to-noise ratio (SNR) between 5dB∼10dB and randomly select noise from the speech subset. For the video, image blur is a common noise. To generate blurry images, we downsample the image to lose some details and then upsample the low-resolution image to keep the size unchanged. This paper randomly selects a downsampling factor from 𝑟 = {1, 2, 4}.",

      "text": "Unlike MER-SEMI and MER-NOISE which predict the most likely emotion within a fixed label space, MER-OV needs to predict any number of emotions in any category. Previously, researchers made an initial attempt at this task  [8] . They first annotated emotionrelated acoustic and visual clues. Then, they relied on the reasoning ability of LLMs to disambiguate subtitles using these clues. This process can generate descriptions with rich emotions. After that, they used GPT-3.5 (\"gpt-3.5-turbo-16k-0613\") to extract all labels using the following prompt: Please assume the role of an expert in the field of emotions. We provide clues that may be related to the emotions of the characters. Based on the provided clues, please identify the emotional states of the main characters. Please separate different emotional categories with commas and output only the clearly identifiable emotional categories in a list format. If none are identified, please output an empty list.\n\nFinally, they performed the manual check and got the ground truth 𝑌 𝑔𝑡 . Through the above process, each sample can have an average of 3 labels. However, due to the high cost, they only annotated 332 samples  [8] . For MER-OV, participants can borrow some basic ideas from this process. Meanwhile, we encourage participants to use MLLMs or to further conduct instruction fine-tuning.",

For MER-OV, each team can submit any number of labels in any category. Meanwhile, participants cannot use closed-source models (such as GPT or Claude) in MER-OV. For all tracks, participants should predict results for 115,595 unlabeled data, although we only evaluate a small subset of them. It requires participants to focus on the generalization ability and develop systems that do not require a lot of inference time. Additionally, participants cannot manually annotate samples in MER2024. We will ask them to submit the code for further checking. Finally, each team should submit a paper describing their method.

For feature selection, we adopt the recommendations of MERBench [1]. Language compatibility is important for lexical and acoustic features, so we mainly select encoders trained on Chinese corpora. Domain compatibility is important for visual features. Therefore, besides encoders trained on action or caption datasets, we also select encoders trained on human-centric videos. Table  2  lists the model cards of some representative encoders.\n\nRegarding the fusion strategy, MERBench points out that the attention mechanism can achieve relatively good performance  [1] . The reason lies in that the labeled samples are limited in emotion recognition. Complex architectures may cause overfitting problems, which will affect the model's generalization ability on unseen data. Assume that acoustic, lexical, and visual features are 𝑓 𝑎 ∈ R 𝑑 𝑎 , 𝑓 𝑙 ∈ R 𝑑 𝑙 , 𝑓 𝑣 ∈ R 𝑑 𝑣 , respectively. During the fusion process, we first map them to a fixed dimension 𝑑:   3 : Prompt for generating emotion-related descriptions using MLLMs (drawn from previous works  [8] ).",

To find the optimal hyper-parameters, we randomly select 50 parameter combinations and choose the best-performing combination in five-fold cross-validation. Finally, we report its average result and standard deviation.\n\nFor MER-OV, we directly use pretrained MLLMs. Due to limited GPU memory, we use their 7B weights by default.

This phenomenon suggests that unsupervised or semi-supervised strategies can capture universal representations, which are also helpful for emotion recognition. Meanwhile, previous works have emphasized the importance of domain compatibility Table  6 : Baseline results on MER-OV (taken from previous works  [8] ). The values in the gray column are used for the final ranking. Here, \"L\", \"V\", and \"A\" indicate whether lexical, visual, and acoustic information are used during inference. For the acoustic and lexical modalities, we primarily choose encoders trained on the Chinese corpus, as suggested by MERBench [1]. For the acoustic modality, we observe that unsupervised or semi-supervised models (e.g., HUBERT-large) generally perform better than traditional encoders (e.g., eGeMAPS), which is consistent with the findings in the visual modality.
