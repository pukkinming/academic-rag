      "text": "Emotional Analysis from textual input has been considered both a challenging and interesting task in Natural Language Processing. However due to the lack of datasets in low-resource languages (i.e. Tamil), it is difficult to conduct research of high standard in this area. Therefore we introduce this labeled dataset (a largest manually annotated dataset of more than 42k Tamil YouTube comments, labeled for 31 emotions including neutral) for emotion recognition. The goal of this dataset is to improve emotion detection in multiple downstream tasks in Tamil.We have also created three different groupings of our emotions (3-class, 7-class and 31-class) and evaluated the model's performance on each category of the grouping. Our MURIL-base model has achieved a 0.60 macro average F1-score across our 3-class group dataset. With 7-class and 31-class groups, the Random Forest model performed well with a macro average F1-scores of 0.42 and 0.29 respectively.",

      "text": "Emotional analysis is the classification task of mining emotions in texts, which finds use in various natural language applications such as reviews analysis in e-commerce, public opinion analysis, extensive search, personalized recommendation, healthcare, and online teaching  (Peng et al., 2021) .Emotions are psychological state that are often expressed through behaviour or language. Emotional analysis helps to analyze the text and extract the emotions which are expressed in the text. This is why emotional analysis plays a significant role in Natural Language Processing (NLP) and its applications. Most e-commerce and social media platforms have no restriction on users to creating informal content. Moreover, these platforms allow users to communicate in such a way that they feel comfortable either using native language or switching between one or more languages in the same conversation  (Vyas et al., 2014)  in order to improve user experience. However, most NLP systems that are trained on monolingual text fail when it comes to analyzing user-generated data  (Chakravarthi et al., 2020b) . Furthermore, most of the developments in emo-tional analysis systems are performed on monolingual data for high-resource languages. In contrast, the user-generated content in under-resourced languages is often mixed with English or other highresource languages  (Jose et al., 2020) . Code-Mixed or Code-Switched text is a text that contains mixed vocabulary and syntax of multiple languages at the level of the document, paragraph, comments, sentence, phrase, word or morpheme.  (Chakravarthi et al., 2021) . Since monolingual text lacks expressions, multilingual societies use codemixed text to their conversation or dialogue  (Vasantharajan and Thayasivam, 2021a) . Other than the code-mixing, people tend to use roman characters for texting on social media platforms instead of the native script. This has raised many challenges for natural language processing and encouraged researchers to develop various algorithms to handle code-mixed text and roman characters  (Vasantharajan and Thayasivam, 2021b) . In this paper, we describe the creation of a monolingual corpus for Tamil (a Dravidian language). Tamil is an official language in Sri Lanka and Singapore. Moreover, Tamil is widely spoken by millions of people around the world. But, the tools and resources available for developing robust NLP applications are under-developed for Tamil. In Tamil, the most complex words are formed by stringing together morphemes without changing them in spelling or phonetics  (Sakuntharaj and Mahesan, 2016) . Also, the writing system is a phonemic abugida written from left to right, and at one point in history, it used Tamili, Vattezhuthu, Chola, Pallava and Chola-Pallava scripts. Today's modern Tamil script was retrieved from the Chola-Pallava script that was conceived around the 4th century CE  (Sakuntharaj and Mahesan, 2018) . Regarding the Dravidian languages, there are various monolingual datasets available for numerous research aims. However, there have been few attempts to make code-mixed datasets for Tamil, Kannada and Malayalam  (Chakravarthi et al., 2020a)  and  (Chakravarthi et al., 2020b) . We will help overcome this resource bottleneck for Tamil by creating this dataset in order to equip Tamil with NLP support in emotional analysis in a way that is both cost-effective and rapid. To create resources for a Tamil scenario, we collected comments on various Tamil movie trailers and teasers from YouTube. The contributions of this paper are:\n\n1. We present a dataset for Tamil for the emotional analysis task.\n\n2. This monolingual dataset contains 31 types of labels with 42,686 comments.\n\n3. We evaluated this dataset on traditional Machine learning models and also provided benchmark results on pre-trained models.",

      "text": "In the past decade, several researchers have released emotion recognition datasets in several languages for a variety of domains, but they contained only a very small number of emotions, about 4 to 7, also it contained a smaller number of samples. Recently  (Rashkin et al., 2019 ) released an Empathetic dialogues dataset which consisted of text conversations labeled with 32 emotions and  (Demszky et al., 2020)  released GoEmotions which consists of Reddit comments labeled with 27 emotion categories for around 52k samples. To the best of our knowledge, there are no previous emotion recognition datasets available for Tamil. This is the first work to create a large dataset of finegrained emotions in the Tamil language.",

      "text": "Emotion classification is a type of text classification task that is used to detect emotions. Both traditional machine learning and Deep Learning models can be employed to classify emotions. Traditional machine learning models often use lexicons such as the Valence Arousal Dominance Lexicon  (Mohammad, 2018) . Deep Learning Models such as RNN, LSTMs and Transformer models can also be employed for this task. Transfer learning methods such as BERT  (Devlin et al., 2019) , Roberta  (Liu et al., 2019)  has achieved state of the art results in major NLP tasks. (Cortiz, 2021) fine-tuned different pre-trained models such as BERT, DistilBert, Roberta, XLNet and Electra and Roberta provided the better results.  (Suresh and Ong, 2021)  and  (Khanpour and Caragea, 2018 ) used a method to incorporate knowledge from emotion lexicons into an attention mechanism to improve emotion classification. In our work, we have used traditional Machine learning models and multilingual transformer models to provide a strong baseline to this dataset.",

      "text": "Data in social media platforms such as Twitter, Facebook and YouTube, are changing rapidly and can alter the perception or reputation of an individual or community drastically. This highlights the importance of automation in emotional analysis. YouTube is a popular social media platform in the Indian subcontinent due to its wide range of content available, such as movies, trailers, songs, tutorials, product reviews and etc. YouTube allows users to create content as well as allows other users to engage and interact with this content through actions such as liking or commenting. Because of this, there is more user-generated content in underresourced languages. Hence, we chose YouTube to extract comments to create our dataset. We collected data from movie trailers and teasers to create our dataset because movies are quite popular among the Tamil speaking populace in most countries. This significantly increases the chance of getting various views on one topic from different people. Figure  1  shows the steps that we followed to create our dataset. We used a YouTube Comment Scraper tool 1 for crawling comments from the YouTub videos and processing the collected comments to make the datasets for emotional analysis with manual annotations. We intended to collect comments that contain purely monolingual texts in the native Tamil language, with enough representation for each emotion class, so we did not worry about Code-Mixed text. As a part of the preprocessing steps to clean the data, we utilized langdetect library 2 to capture different languages and to eliminate the unintended languages. Also, in order to maintain data privacy, we made sure that all the user-related information was removed from the corpora. As a part of the text-preprocessing, we removed redundant information such as URL, comments that are nearly the same as other comments according to the Levenshtein Distance using a python library 3 . Moreover, we retained all the emojis, emoticons, and punctuation, and etc that are presented in the text to faithfully preserve the real-world usage.",

      "text": "We contacted the Indian Institute of Information Technology and Management in order to find volunteers for the annotation process. We created Google Forms that contain 25 comments in one page to collect annotations from annotators and send them through email. The student volunteer annotators received the link to the Google Forms and did the annotations on their personal computers or mobile phones. During the annotation process, gender, educational background and medium of schooling were also collected to ensure that the group of volunteers was diverse, with an equal/adequate reprsentation of gender,sexual orientation and socio-economic backgrounds. The annotators were cautioned that the user suggestions may have aggressive language. They were given a provision to discontinue the annotation process in case the content is too upsetting to deal with. They were requested not to be partial to a specific individual, circumstance or occasion during the annotation process. The annotators were also instructed to agree on the annotation guidelines before they were allowed to proceed further. We finished the annotation process in three stages. As the first step, each comment was annotated by two individuals. Then included the annotated comment in the dataset if both the annotations agreed.\n\nIn the event of contention, a third annotator was requested to annotate the comment. In the final stage, if all three of them disagreed, at that point, two additional annotators were asked to label the comments. Therefore, each form was annotated by at least three annotators.\n\n3 https://pypi.org/project/pylev/",

From Table  1 , we can see that 9 male and 7 female annotators volunteered to contribute to the task. The distribution of male annotators is slightly higher than female annotators in the task. The majority of the annotators have received undergraduate levels of education. We were also unable to find volunteers of the transgender community to annotate our dataset. From Table  1 , we can observe that the majority of the annotators' medium of schooling is English even though their mother tongue is Tamil. Since most of the participants' medium of education was the English language, we were careful that it would not affect the annotation process by ensuring that all of them are fully proficient in using the Tamil language.\n\nOnce the forms were created, a sample form (first assignment) was annotated by experts and a gold standard was created. Then, we manually compared the volunteer's submission form with gold standard annotations. Then, we eliminated the annotators for the following reasons during the first assignment to control the quality of annotation. • Annotators delayed unreasonably for respond-\n\n• labeled all sentences with the same label.\n\n• More than 10 annotations in a form were wrong.\n\nAfter the elimination, a total of 16 volunteers were involved in the annotation task. Once they completed the given Google Forms, 10 Google Forms (250 comments) were sent to them. If an annotator offered to volunteer more, the next set of Google Forms was sent to them with another set of 250 comments and in this way, each volunteer chose to annotate as many comments from the corpus as they wished.",

This is important to verify that the annotation process is consistent and that different annotators are able to label the same emotion label to a given comment. Generally, there are two questions that arise about the inter-annotator agreement. They are:\n\n• How do the raters agree or disagree in their annotation?\n\n• How much of the observed agreement or disagreement among the annotators might be due to chance?\n\nTo answer these questions and to ensure the annotation reliability, we used Krippendorff's alpha(α)  (Krippendorff, 1970)  as a inter-annotator agreement measure. For instance, if the annotators vary between Admiration and Anticipation classes, the difference is more genuine than when they differ between Optimism and Trust classes. α is sensitive and is characterized as follows:\n\nwhere D o is the observed disagreement between emotion labels annotated by the annotators and D e is the expected disagreement when the coding of emotions can be attributed to chance rather than due to the inherent property of the emotion itself. We used agreement module from nltk 4 for calculating α. The results of inter-annotator agreement between our annotators is 0.7452.\n\n4 https://www.nltk.org/",
