      "text": "The affective brain-computer interface is a crucial technology for affective interaction and emotional intelligence, emerging as a significant area of research in the human-computer interaction. Compared to single-type features, multi-type EEG features provide a multi-level representation for analyzing multi-dimensional emotions. However, the high dimensionality of multi-type EEG features, combined with the relatively small number of high-quality EEG samples, poses challenges such as classifier overfitting and suboptimal real-time performance in multi-dimensional emotion recognition. Moreover, practical applications of affective brain-computer interface frequently encounters partial absence of multi-dimensional emotional labels due to the open nature of the acquisition environment, and ambiguity and variability in individual emotion perception. To address these challenges, this study proposes a novel EEG feature selection method for missing multi-dimensional emotion recognition. The method leverages adaptive orthogonal non-negative matrix factorization to reconstruct the multi-dimensional emotional label space through second-order and higher-order correlations, which could reduce the negative impact of missing values and outliers on label reconstruction. Simultaneously, it employs least squares regression with graph-based manifold learning regularization and global feature redundancy minimization regularization to enable EEG feature subset selection despite missing information, ultimately achieving robust EEG-based multi-dimensional emotion recognition. Simulation experiments on three widely used multi-dimensional emotional datasets, DREAMER, DEAP and HDED, reveal that the proposed method outperforms thirteen advanced feature selection methods in terms of robustness for EEG emotional feature selection.",

      "text": "Based on the strategy of depicting emotions, emotion representation models can be broadly classified into two categories: discrete emotional models and multi-dimensional emotional models. Compared to discrete emotional models, multi-dimensional emotional models offer broader characterization and are capable of describing the evolution of emotional states  (Ezzameli and Mahersia 2023) . Electroencephalography (EEG) is a non-invasive technology that (2) The high dimensionality of multi-type EEG features and the relatively small number of samples lead to the curse problem of dimensionality. monitors neural activities and can quickly respond to diverse emotional states  (Yang et al. 2024; Zhang, Zhong, and Liu 2024) . Recently, EEG-based affective brain-computer interface (a-BCI) systems have garnered significant attention in the fields of affective interaction and emotional intelligence due to its high temporal resolution and undisguisable characteristics  (Si et al. 2024; Liu et al. 2024) . Multiple EEG feature extraction approaches, including differential entropy, function connectivity, and absolute power etc, have been employed to analyze the non-stationary and nonlinear specificities of EEG recordings, thereby facilitating precise emotional state identification.\n\nThe number of sensors available for affective computing is growing rapidly owing to advancements in EEG acquisition devices, leading to a vast amount of features derived from these electrodes  (Wang, Wu, and Yao 2020) . However, given the relatively small number of high-quality EEG instances, the features often become high-dimensional and may include redundant, useless, or interference information, which can substantially impair identification performance of emotional states  (Wang et al. 2020; Xu et al. 2023) . Feature selection is a valid approach for identifying significant features and eliminating irrelevant ones from the original set, thereby preserving the essential neural representation of EEG features and improving the transparency and interpretability of the affective computing model  (Xu et al. 2024; Jenke, Peer, and Buss 2014) . According to their feature evaluation and search mechanisms, EEG feature selection methods can be broadly categorized into following three types: filter, wrapper, and embedded methods  (Zhang et al. 2019b) .\n\nFilter methods evaluate the significance of EEG features in emotion recognition based on the statistical or information entropy characteristics of the data. However, these techniques often yield unsatisfactory EEG feature selection performance, regardless of the interactions the learning models  (Zhang et al. 2019b ). To solve this problem, several studies have explored wrapper methods  (Nakisa et al. 2018; Asemi and Farajzadeh 2025) , which adopt random or sequential search strategies to \"wrap\" features into candidate subsets and then a learning or prediction model is employed to compare the performance of these candidate subsets. The wrapper techniques generally obtain better learning performance than filter methods. Nonetheless, wrapper methods often involve numerous trials and incur substantial computational costs  (Saeys, Inza, and Larranaga 2007) .\n\nRecently, there has been growing interest in embedded approaches as a potential alternative to overcome the limitations of filter methods. Embedded techniques integrate the search for informative and non-redundant EEG features into the model optimization problem, evaluating the relative importance of each EEG feature while optimizing the learning models. Their effectiveness in EEG-based affective computing tasks has been demonstrated  (Xu et al. 2020 (Xu et al. , 2023)) .\n\nExisting EEG feature selection studies usually assume that EEG emotional data are complete. Nevertheless, due to the open nature of the acquisition environment, and ambiguity and variability in individual emotion perception, practical applications of the a-BCI frequently encounter partial absence of multi-dimensional emotional labels. This missing information directly hinders accurate modeling of the relationship between multi-channel EEG recordings and multidimensional emotional labels.\n\nTo address the challenges, we employ extended adaptive orthogonal non-negative matrix factorization to propose a robust EEG feature selection (REFS) method with incomplete multi-dimensional emotion recognition, as illustrated in Fig.  1 . This method reconstructs the label space by leveraging second-order and higher-order correlations within the multi-dimensional emotional labels, while simultaneously selecting discriminative and non-redundant EEG features despite the presence of incomplete multi-dimensional emotional labeling information.\n\nFurthermore, the contributions of our work are as follows:\n\n• An incomplete multi-dimensional emotional feature selection method is proposed for a-BCI applications. REFS integrates EEG emotional feature selection into a extended adaptive orthogonal non-negative matrix factor-ization framework. It can effectively mitigates the impact of missing values and outliers on EEG feature selection model construction, and incorporates second-order and higher-order correlations within multi-dimensional emotional labels to restore the missing emotional labels. • To address the optimization problem of REFS, an efficient alternative scheme is proposed to guarantee convergence and achieve an optimal solution. • To validate the effectiveness of REFS for incomplete multi-dimensional emotion feature selection, we employed three public EEG-based emotion datasets, DREAMER, DEAP, and HDED, which contain multidimensional emotional labels. Experimental results show that REFS outperforms thirteen state-of-the-art feature selection methods, achieving superior emotion recognition performance across six performance metrics.",

      "text": "EEG feature selection methods EEG feature selection techniques could be broadly categorized into three groups based on their interaction with learning models: filter, wrapper, and embedded methods  (Zhang et al. 2019b) . Filter methods evaluate the importance of each feature according to specific criteria. The most informative EEG features, which score highly, are then selected. Examples of such techniques include information gain  (Chen et al. 2015) , mRMR  (Wang, Nie, and Lu 2011; Lin et al. 2024) , ReliefF  (Zhang et al. 2016) , etc. However, the filter methods may overlook potentially important features that, when combined with other features, could improve discrimination. This is because the learning models are not considered during the feature selection process  (Saeys, Inza, and Larranaga 2007) . Wrapper methods, by contrast, \"wrap\" feature subsets into candidate EEG feature sets using random or sequential search strategies. A learning model then evaluates the performance of these candidate subsets. Several widely used wrapper methods, such as the evolutionary computation algorithm  (Nakisa et al. 2018 ) and the ReliefF-based genetic algorithm  (Kong, Yan, and Xu 2017) , have been proposed or applied to the EEG-based affective computing task. However, the computational cost of wrapper methods is often much higher than filter methods due to the iterative strategy of candidate feature subset search (Bolón-Canedo and Alonso-Betanzos 2019).\n\nTo overcome the limitations of the above feature selection approaches, embedded methods have been introduced  (Hao, Gao, and Hu 2025) . These methods integrate feature selection into the model learning process, evaluating the relative importance of each EEG feature while simultaneously optimizing learning models. The most frequently used statistical model for embedded feature selection is least squares regression (LSR), which is recognized for its statistical completeness and efficiency in data analysis  (Nie et al. 2010; Chen et al. 2018; Xu et al. 2022; Wu et al. 2021) . LSR-based feature selection algorithms aim to learn a projection matrix W and rank feature significance using {∥w 1 ∥ 2 , ..., ∥w d ∥ 2 |}  (Yang et al. 2019) .
