      "text": "Aspect-based sentiment analysis plays an essential role in natural language processing and artificial intelligence. Recently, researchers only focused on aspect detection and sentiment classification but ignoring the subtask of detecting user opinion span, which has enormous potential in practical applications. In this paper, we present a new Vietnamese dataset (UIT-ViSD4SA) consisting of 35,396 human-annotated spans on 11,122 feedback comments for evaluating the span detection in aspect-based sentiment analysis. Besides, we also propose a novel system using Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory (BiLSTM) with a Conditional Random Field (CRF) layer (BiLSTM-CRF) for the span detection task in Vietnamese aspectbased sentiment analysis. The best result is a 62.76% F1 macro for span detection using BiLSTM-CRF with embedding fusion of syllable embedding, character embedding, and contextual embedding from XLM-RoBERTa. In future work, span detection will be extended in many NLP tasks such as constructive detection, emotion recognition, complaint analysis, and opinion mining. Our dataset is freely available at https://github. com/kimkim00/UIT-ViSD4SA for research purposes.",

      "text": "Typically, before buying an item or deciding to use a service, people tend to seek advice from their predecessors who purchased the item or used the service. With the rapid development of the internet, more and more people find advice from websites, e-commerce sites, forums, or product review channels. Massive user reviews available on e-commerce platforms are becoming valuable resources for both customers and producers. For customers, this data source provides information about products and helpful advice to help them avoid buying products or signing up for services that are not suitable for their personal needs. On the other hand, user reviews are also valuable information for businesses, and if used correctly and effectively, this data can help businesses improve product quality, accurately identify the target customers for each segment.\n\nAspect-based sentiment analysis (ABSA)  (Hu and Liu, 2004 ) on user feedback is a challenging task that attracts interest from both academia and industries  (Jo and Oh, 2011; Kiritchenko et al., 2014; Chen et al., 2017) . Given specific feedback about a product or service, the main task of ABSA is to detect what is being discussed, then give sentiment analysis to the explored aspect. The ABSA problem can be divided into three basic tasks as follows: aspect detection, opinion target expression (OTE), sentiment polarity. In this paper, we focus on detecting the opinions of users based on aspects and their sentiment, which we call span detection for ABSA. Specifically, when a review is given \"Although staffs are nice, the phone is terrible!\", the span detection for ABSA task aims to get two opinions \"staffs are nice\" and \"the phone is terrible\", then classify these into right aspects also sentiment polarity. The task is described as follows:\n\n• Input: A customer feedback C for a smartphone that consists of n characters.\n\narXiv:2110.07833v1 [cs.CL] 15 Oct 2021\n\n• Output: One or more spans of customer opinions are extracted directly from feedback C for each aspect. Each span is extracted from position i to position j such that 0 ≤ i, j ≤ n and i ≤ j.\n\nUser interface contributes a significant part to the shopping experience on e-commerce platforms. The user interfaces of e-commerce sites are more convenient than ever before with the help of ABSA techniques. If an e-commerce site adopts ABSA to their platform, customers can focus on corresponding reviews effectively by choosing the aspect-based sentiment text they care. Besides, the site owners can keep track of their product and service qualities with the help of ABSA. Several Chinese ecommerce platforms such as Taobao, Dianping deploy ABSA-based user interfaces to improve user experience. Therefore, the potential and importance of ABSA techniques for this area are immense. On the other hand, E-commerce sites present in Vietnam are still inferior in providing feedback to users. Most e-commerce platforms in Vietnam provide a simple feedback system: users leave their comments on the system along with a 5-star rating system like the one in Figure  1 . Such systematic platforms include thegioididong 1  , fptshop 2  , shopee 3  , tiki 4  , and lazada 5  . Different from the rest, foody 6  (a restaurant review platform) allows users to respond on a 10-point scale and provides that score on several specific aspects (location, price, quality, service, and space). Therefore, we focus on the span detection for the ABSA problem, which not only detects aspects and their sentiment polarity but also detects spans of opinion.\n\nTo the best of our knowledge, current public datasets are constructed for ABSA, which limits further explorations of span detection. To addressing the problem and advancing the related research, this paper presents UIT-ViSD4SA, a benchmark Vietnamese smartphone feedback dataset for ABSA and span detection. All the feedback in UIT-ViSD4SA is collected from an e-commerce platform. There are 11,122 user comments, and each is manually anno-Figure  1 : A feedback from an e-commerce site in Vietnam. The comment means \"(I) will recommended to friends and family: Good prices but still have 5g, X has never made me disappointed. Y staff is very enthusiastic.\" in English. tated according to its spans towards ten fine-grained aspect categories with sentiment polarities. Figure  2  shows an annotated illustrative datapoint.\n\nWe have three main contributions summarized as follows:\n\n• First and foremost, we create a benchmark Vietnamese feedback dataset toward span detection aspect category sentiment analysis, named UIT-ViSD4SA, including 35,396 spans on 11,122 real-world smartphone feedback comments annotated with ten aspect categories.\n\nThe dataset is available freely for research purposes.\n\n• Next, we propose an approach using BiLSTM-CRF with embedding fusion for span detection in Vietnamese aspect-based sentiment analysis.\n\n• Last but not least, we provide several case studies and future suggestions for span detection in Vietnamese aspect-based sentiment analysis.\n\nThe rest of the paper is organized as follows. In Section 2, we present the related work. In Section 3, we explain the data building process. The architecture of the approach is described in detail in Section 4. In Section 5, we implement a BiLSTM-CRF model to solve the problem and analysis to find the weakness of the method on our dataset. Finally, Section 6 draws conclusions and future work.",

      "text": "The SemEval dataset series includes user reviews from e-commerce websites motivated for muchrelated ABSA research  (Li et al., 2019; Luo et al., 2020; Chen and Qian, 2020) . The SemEval-2014 task 4 (SE-ABSA14)  (Pontiki et al., 2014)  dataset consists of restaurant and laptop reviews. The restaurant subset includes five aspects categories (i.e., Food, Service, Price, Ambience and Anecdotes/Miscellaneous) and four polarity labels (i.e., Positive, Negative, Conflict and Neutral). The laptop subset was just annotated for aspect category detection and sentiment polarity classification. SemEval-2015 Task 12  (Pontiki et al., 2015)  dataset (SE-ABSA15) is built based on SE-ABSA14. SE-ABSA15 describes its aspect category as an entity type combined with an attribute type (e.g., Food#Style Options) and removes the Conflict polarity label. The SemEval-2016 task-5  (Pontiki et al., 2016)  dataset (SE-ABSA16) extended SE-ABSA15 to new domains such as Hotels, Consumer Electronics, Telecom, Museums, and other languages (Dutch, French, Russian, Spanish, Turkish, and Arabic).\n\nCompared with the prosperity of rich resource languages such as English, Chinese, or Spanish, the number of high-quality Vietnamese datasets are very low. In 2018, the first ABSA shared-task in Vietnamese was organized by the Vietnamese Language and Speech Processing (VLSP) community  (Nguyen et al., 2019b) . VLSP provided an ABSA dataset composed of hotel and restaurant reviews. Unfortunately, the VLSP dataset inspired by SE-ABSA15 was only annotated for entity#atribute aspect category and its sentiment but ignoring the Opinion Target Extraction.  Nguyen et al. (2019a)  proposed the dataset on the same domains as restaurants and hotels, including only 7,828 reviews at document-level with seven aspects combined with five polarity sentiments for two tasks. Dang et al. (  2021 ) also built a dataset for the same domain as two previous works annotated with high inter-annotator agreements at the sentence level.  Mai et al. (2018)  collected and annotated Vietnamese ABSA corpora consisted of only 2,098 sentences for two tasks: opinion target extraction and sentiment polarity detection for the smartphone domain. They presented a multi-task model for the two tasks using the sequence labeling scheme associated with bidirectional recurrent neural networks (BRNN) and conditional random field (CRF). To evaluate aspect-based sentiment analysis for mobile e-commerce, Phan et al., (2021) created a benchmark dataset (UIT-ViSFD) with 11,122 comments based on a strict annotation scheme. Furthermore, they developed a social listening system in Vietnamese based on aspect-based sentiment analysis. For span detection in ABSA,  Hu et al. (2019)  proposed a span-based extract-then-classify framework, where multiple opinion targets are directly extracted from the sentence under the supervision of Aspect Definition",

The creation process of our dataset is described as follows. To begin with, we edit and revise the annotation guidelines from  (Phan et al., 2021)  for annotators to determine spans and how to annotate data correctly (see Section 3.1). Annotators are trained with the guidelines and annotate data to ensure that the F1-score in the training process reaches over 80% before performing data annotation independently (see Section 3.2). Finally, we provide an analysis of the dataset that helps experts understand this dataset (see Section 3.3). We utilize the ABSA dataset collected from an e-commerce website for smartphones in Vietnam, which allows customers to write fine-grained reviews of a smartphone they have purchased. In the reviews, users comment on multiple aspects either explicitly or implicitly about many aspects such as camera, price, battery, service, and etcetera. The dataset includes 11,122 feedback with four attributes: comment, n star, date time, and label. Table 1 summarizes ten aspects in the guidelines, and each aspect has one of three sentiments (positive, negative, and neutral).",

The span is defined as the shortest span containing the opinions of the user about the aspect category. With ten predefined aspects, annotators are asked to annotate spans towards aspect categories with sentiment polarities of each review. Suppose a review is given, when a span is discovered within the review either explicitly or implicitly, the aspect category with sentiment polarity of that span is labeled as aspect#polarity as in Figure  1 .",

To begin with, we train annotators with the guidelines and randomly take about 30-70 reviews in the dataset to annotate, then calculate F1-core per review for those annotated data. For disagreement cases, annotators decide the final label by discussing and having a voting poll. Annotators spend four training rounds to obtain a high F1-score above 80% before performing data annotation independently.  An annotation is a triple (d, l, o), where d is a document id, l a label, and o is a list of start-end character offset tuples. An annotator i contributes a (multi)set A i of (token) annotations. We compute (1) for each 2-combination of annotators and report arithmetic mean of F1 across all these combinations  (Hripcsak and Rothschild, 2005) . Grouping annotations by documents or labels allows us to calculate F1 per document or label.\n\nFinally, our dataset is divided randomly into three sets: the training (Train), development (Dev), and test (Test) in the ratio 7:1:2.

The LSTM is equipped with a memory cell with an adaptive adjustment mechanism that adjusts information to be added to or removed from the cell.

According to our results, we can see that concatenate three embedding layers (syllable, character, and bert-based embedding) have significantly better performance than just one or two embedding layers. In particular, syllabel+char+XLMRlarge achieves the best F1 macro of 62.76%, 49.77%, and 45.70% for aspect, polarity, and aspect#polarity, respectively, whereas the model with just syllable embedding layer shows the lowest performances. On the other hand, our method tends to be less efficient with labels which consist of polarity, in which polarity task reach 49.77% F1 macro while aspect#polarity task gets 45.70% F1 macro . Detailed results per class of each task are shown in Tables  4, 5 , and 6 (with aspect#polarity label, we only show F1-score). For aspect task, only two aspects have a high F1-score above 70% (CAM-ERA and BATTERY) while the rest range from 60-70%, especially F1-score of PRICE and STORAGE is relatively low (below 50%). With the polarity task, the result is descending with the order POS-ITIVE, NEGATIVE, NEUTRAL. The result of aspect#polarity can be considered the sum of the two previous tasks: previous high-performing aspects labels combined with positive give the highest result. This result explains the lack of quantity uniformity in the labels (labels consist of NEUTRAL polarity only cover 6.25% of our dataset, detail in Figure  4 ). In general, our approach gets better performance when it comes to detecting span for aspect than polarity and aspect#polarity span detection.

With the cases of misclassification, we found that many cases of this mistake contained English loanwords. For example, in comment 2, the span \"Really like the dark mode\" is about the interface, and we annotate it as PERFORMACNE#POSITIVE. However, the model can understand it and classify it as CAMERA (as-   label is directed.
