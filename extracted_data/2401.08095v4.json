Existing EVC methods often rely on text transcriptions or time-alignment information and struggle to handle varying speech durations effectively. In this paper, we propose DurFlex-EVC, a duration-flexible EVC framework that operates without the need for text or alignment information. We introduce a unit aligner that models contextual information by aligning speech with discrete units representing content, eliminating the need for text or speech-text alignment. Additionally, we design a style autoencoder that effectively disentangles content and emotional style, allowing precise manipulation of the emotional characteristics of the speech. We further enhance emotional expressiveness through a hierarchical stylize encoder that applies the target emotional style at multiple hierarchical levels, refining the stylization process to improve the naturalness and expressiveness of the converted speech. Experimental results from subjective and objective evaluations demonstrate that our approach outperforms baseline models, effectively handling duration variability and enhancing emotional expressiveness in the converted speech.",

      "text": "E MOTIONAL voice conversion (EVC) involves modifying various acoustic characteristics of a voice, such as pitch and spectral envelope, to match a desired emotional state while preserving the speaker's identity  [1] . EVC has gained prominence, particularly in the realm of voice-interactive technologies such as virtual assistants and internet of things (IoT) devices, improving the human-like and emotionally resonant aspects of digital interactions  [2] -  [5] .\n\nIn the context of EVC, a crucial objective is to preserve the speaker identity and content of the original speech while modifying only those speech attributes that convey emotion  [1] ,  [6] . This necessitates an adjustment of prosody to align with the intended emotion. Prosody elements, including intonation, rhythm, and energy, play a critical role in both conveying and recognizing emotions in speech. Although the concept of controlling prosody for emotional conversion is intuitively appealing  [7] , refining each prosody component presents a significant challenge.\n\nThe field of EVC has been revolutionized by advances in deep learning  [8] ,  [9] . Initial approaches employed Gaussian mixture models  [10]  to convert spectral and prosody features, producing more expressive voices. Subsequent developments led to autoencoder-based methods  [11] -  [13] , enabling learning in non-parallel data-driven EVC. VAE-based approaches  [14]  and GAN-based frameworks  [15] -such as Cycle-GAN  [16] , StarGAN  [17] , and VAE-GAN  [18] -represent further advances. However, these methods often overlook the importance of rhythm in expressing emotion, as they typically support emotional conversion with fixed durations.\n\nSequence-to-sequence (Seq2Seq) models, capable of implicitly modeling duration, have become a notable development  [19] ,  [20] . These models often employ strategies, such as a two-stage learning approach integrating a text-to-speech (TTS) model, to improve stability  [21] ,  [22] . However, Seq2Seq models face challenges like long-term dependency and repetition, necessitating parallel generation for efficiency and reliability. Parallel generation requires explicit duration modeling, which many voice conversion models  [23]  achieve through phoneme duration derived from TTS alignments. Obtaining phoneme duration often requires encoder-decoder attention from pretrained autoregressive TTS models  [24]  or external forced alignment tools  [25] .\n\nRecently, discrete speech units derived from self-supervised learning representations have shown promise in addressing parallel generation challenges  [26] -  [29] . Certain studies  [28] ,  [29]  have proposed methods that model speech emotion conversion as a translation task, thereby enabling parallel audio generation. However, these methods still rely on autoregressive models for emotional translation, limiting their effectiveness in fully parallel generation.\n\nIn this paper, we propose a duration-flexible EVC framework, DurFlex-EVC, that eliminates the need for text or alignment information while supporting parallel generation. We use discrete speech units to model content and incorporate arXiv:2401.08095v4 [cs.SD] 21 Jan 2025 self-supervised representations to enrich acoustic details. Our model predicts unit sequences and their durations, which allows for flexible duration control.\n\nOur main contributions are as follows:\n\n• We propose DurFlex-EVC, a duration-flexible EVC framework that uses discrete speech units for content modeling, eliminating the need for text or external alignment information while supporting efficient parallel generation.\n\n• We introduce a unit aligner that models contextual relationships between speech features and unit sequences, enabling effective duration control without relying on text-based alignment. • We develop a style autoencoder that separates and reintroduces emotional styles in the input features, facilitating content-style disentanglement for emotional voice conversion.\n\n• We design a hierarchical stylize encoder that captures both global and local emotional patterns, thereby enhancing the expressiveness of emotional speech. • We perform extensive subjective and objective evaluations, demonstrating the superior performance of our method compared to existing approaches.",

Exploring Self-Supervised Learning in Speech\n\nSelf-supervised learning (SSL) is a machine learning paradigm in which models are trained on unlabeled datasets to generate meaningful representations. This approach is particularly advantageous in speech processing, where labeling data is labor-intensive and expensive. Models like wav2vec 2.0  [30]  and vq-wav2vec  [31]  have demonstrated SSL's potential, with wav2vec 2.0 leveraging contrastive learning and vq-wav2vec introducing quantization techniques for discrete representations. Subsequent developments, such as XLS-R  [32] , extend these ideas to cross-lingual applications, while models like Hidden-unit BERT (HuBERT)  [33]  and ContentVec  [34]  focus on masked prediction and speaker disentanglement, respectively.\n\nSSL representations have proven valuable across a wide range of speech-related tasks, including automatic speech recognition  [30] , voice conversion  [35] , speaker verification  [36] , and speech emotion recognition  [37] . The increasing adoption of SSL techniques motivates further exploration into how these representations can be leveraged for more complex and resource-efficient speech applications, such as emotional voice conversion, where conventional supervised methods are often limited by data availability.",

Techniques like SoundStream  [38]  and EnCodec  [39]  focus on high-fidelity audio compression, employing methods such as residual vector quantization (RVQ), while UniAudio  [40]  serves as a generalpurpose audio generation model. These neural codec-based methods, aimed at audio compression and restoration, utilize large codebooks and compact dimensions. Although these approaches excel in compression, they are less suited for tasks that require detailed modeling of linguistic and prosodic content.\n\nIn contrast, some methods emphasize encoding speech into semantic units to facilitate applications like speech synthesis  [29]  and emotion conversion  [33] . For instance, techniques have been developed to decompose and reconstruct speech into discrete units for content, pitch, and speaker identity  [26] . To improve naturalness and intelligibility, soft speech units were introduced  [28]  for enhanced content capture. Speech emotion conversion has also been framed as a language translation task  [27] , leveraging discrete representations of phonetic content, prosody, speaker, and emotion alongside neural vocoders for waveform generation. UnitSpeech  [29]  has demonstrated effectiveness in personalized TTS and voice conversion, using self-supervised units to fine-tune a diffusion-based TTS model with minimal data, thus bypassing the need for retraining across tasks. This focus on discrete units offers a promising solution to the challenges of aligning speech content, offering the potential for more efficient and accurate modeling.",

Recent studies have demonstrated that parallel generation methods can offer superior performance and reliability over autoregressive approaches for applications like text-to-speech, voice conversion, and vocoders. In text-to-speech systems, parallel generation typically relies on precise alignments between text and speech. These alignments are often derived using pretrained autoregressive teacher models  [24] , external aligners like the Montreal Forced Aligner (MFA)  [43] , or algorithms such as the monotonic alignment search (MAS)  [41] . Voice conversion methods often attempt to leverage the benefits of parallel generation. While many approaches  [44] ,  [45]  have adopted parallel generation strategies, certain models remain autoregressive  [46]  due to complexities in handling variable durations. To address these challenges, some solutions  [23] ,  [47]  have integrated variable-duration modeling with parallel generation. However, this often requires text-speech alignment similar to TTS frameworks. Additionally, vocoders have used techniques like GANs  [48] , normalizing flows  [49] , and generative diffusion models  [50]  to efficiently produce high-quality waveforms. The success of parallel generation frameworks has inspired further exploration into adapting these techniques for emotional voice conversion, with the goal of achieving efficient and expressive speech synthesis without relying on traditional alignment methods.",

FastSpeech  [24]  improved upon these methods by leveraging alignments from an autoregressive teacher model to explicitly model phoneme duration, thereby enabling parallel generation. Building on this, FastSpeech 2  [25]  introduced phoneme duration extraction using external forced alignment. Glow-TTS  [41]  further refined this approach by employing a monotonic alignment search to find optimal matches between text and latent representations. Duration modeling has also been explored in voice conversion, where seq2seq models are often used to manage variable durations  [46] ,  [53] . The DCVC model  [23]  utilized a phoneme-based information bottleneck for style transfer and speech speed control in voice conversion. Discrete speech units have also been leveraged in voice conversion for modeling duration by counting consecutive occurrences of each unit. This approach allows for effective duration control while bypassing the need for explicit text or phoneme alignment  [26] ,  [29] . In EVC, seq2seq structures have become a popular choice for managing duration variations  [22] ,  [54] .  [27]  leveraged discrete units for parallel emotional voice conversion but still incorporated seq2seq models for the translation of unit sequences, introducing challenges inherent to autoregressive architectures.

This choice provides continuous representations that retain comprehensive acoustic information, essential for accurately modeling emotional characteristics in speech. Next, the style autoencoder separates the emotional style from the input features and applies the desired target emotion. This disentanglement ensures that content and style are managed independently, allowing for precise emotional adaptation without relying on seq2seq structures. The unit aligner then processes the stylized features by aggregating contextual information at the frame level through a cross-attention module. This aggregated representation is compressed to the unit level, preparing it for further processing by the hierarchical stylize encoder. The hierarchical stylize encoder operates at both unit and frame levels, refining the emotional style to ensure consistency and expressiveness across different scales. Finally, the diffusion-based generator synthesizes a highquality Mel-spectrogram from the output of the hierarchical stylize encoder and the style vector.

      "text": "The feature extractor generates representations that encompass both content and style aspects of the speech. In this context, content refers to the linguistic information, while style includes emotional expression and speaker-specific characteristics. To model styles, we distinguish between speaker style and emotional style. The style autoencoder is designed to separate the source emotional style from the input features and apply a target emotional style, facilitating content-style disentanglement. Fig.  1b  shows the structure of the style autoencoder, which consists of two primary components: the de-stylize transformer and the stylize transformer.\n\nLayer Normalization (LN) is employed as a fundamental technique in both transformers, defined as:\n\nwhere z represents the input vector, µ is the mean, and σ is the standard deviation. LN ensures that the inputs to each layer have a consistent distribution, facilitating stable and efficient training.\n\nDe-stylize Transformer: This component removes the source emotional style from the input features, isolating the content. It employs mix-style layer normalization (MixLN)  [55] , which blends the original style vector with a shuffled style vector to disrupt the association between features and the source style, as shown in Fig.  1f . The MixLN is defined as:\n\nwhere\n\n. w is the original style vector, w is the shuffled style vector, and λ is a parameter sampled from a Beta distribution, Beta(α, α). This process helps in disentangling style-independent content by preventing the model from encoding style-specific features.\n\nStylize Transformer: This component applies the target emotional style to the content features. It employs conditional layer normalization (CLN)  [56] , which adjusts the normalized  input based on the target style vector w, as illustrated in Fig.  1g . The CLN is defined as:\n\nwhere γ(w) and β(w) are adaptive parameters derived from the style vector w. CLN allows the model to incorporate the desired emotional style into the content features seamlessly.\n\nThe style autoencoder consists of N de-stylize transformers and N stylize transformers. We construct the source style vector w src by combining the speaker vector s src and the emotion vector e src , and the target style vector w tgt by combining s src with the desired emotion vector e tgt :\n\nBoth the speaker vector s * and the emotion vector e * are obtained from the embedding look-up table. The de-stylize transformer uses w src to disentangle the source emotional style from the input features, while the stylize transformer applies w tgt to encode the target emotional style into the features. This design enables the model to adapt emotional styles effectively without relying on seq2seq structures, thereby supporting parallel processing and flexible duration modeling.",

The attention weights A unit are computed as follows:\n\nwhere d is the dimension of Q and K. Subsequently, these weights A unit are integrated with the value matrix V to produce the attention output z attn .\n\nFig.  1e  shows the process of learning attention weights to predict units and the modeling of the duration of the predicted units. We introduce an additional loss term to guide the attention module to learn semantic information. This approach implies a direct classification task by aligning the attention weights A unit with the target unit sequence y:\n\nwhere L is the length of the unit sequence and C is the number of unit classes, A i,j unit represents the predicted probability of the i-th element for class j from the attention weights A unit , and y i,j is the one-hot encoded class label for the ith unit for class j. We adopt the HuBERT unit as our target unit. This is an intended design feature that ensures that the context reflected in the unit aligner is consistent with the target style, rather than based on the context of the input speech. During the emotional voice conversion process, the style autoencoder first removes the source emotion from the input features and applies the target emotion. The unit aligner then processes these stylized features to predict the corresponding unit sequences. This design enables the model to transform context efficiently.

To extract a distinct sequence of units and their consecutive counts, a deduplication operation is applied:\n\nwhere ŷuniq contains the sequence of unique units, and n count represents the number of consecutive occurrences for each unit. For example, given an input sequence ŷ = [4, 4, 2, 2, 2, 2, 1, 1], the deduplication results in ŷuniq = [4, 2, 1] and n count =  [2, 4, 2] .

The emotion embedding was obtained using emotion2vec. Fig.  3  is a visualization of the features in emotion2vec, which shows that it encodes emotions independently of the speaker. We also evaluated the root mean square error (RMSE) for pitch and energy and calculated the difference of duration (DDUR) to assess prosody. The pitch was extracted using parselmouth  10  in Hz, and the energy was obtained as the L2-norm of the absolute value of the linear spectrogram. DDUR was obtained in the same way as in  [22] .

Each element is modified to align with the target emotion before being synthesized back into speech. • DurFlex-EVC: Our proposed model includes a unit aligner, style autoencoder, stochastic duration predictor, hierarchical stylize encoder, and a diffusion-based generator. This model stands out with its comprehensive and integrated approach to emotional speech synthesis. All comparison models were trained using the official implementation.

Table  II  shows the results of subjective evaluation. Table  III  shows the objective evaluation results. As the nMOS results show, the naturalness of the speech generated by our method outperforms that of other models. In terms of speaker similarity, our approach scored the highest on both sMOS and SECS. Fig.  4  shows the resulting SECS for all combinations of emotional conversions. This demonstrates that the proposed model is more robust in terms of speaker similarity than the comparison models for all combinations of transformations. Furthermore, the results of eMOC, ECA and EECS demonstrate that our method performs better in terms of perceptual quality as well as objective metrics. Fig.  5  shows the resulting EECS for all combinations of emotion transformations. This indicates that the proposed model synthesized speech with a higher emotional similarity than the comparison models for all combinations of transformations. The ASR evaluation also shows that our method achieves lower values in PER, CER, and WER compared to other models. This emphasizes the ability of our method to synthesize precisely pronounced speech.\n\nWe evaluated the computational efficiency of each model by comparing their RTF. Autoregressive models, including Seq2seq-EVC, Emovox, Mixed Emotion, and Textless-EVC, generally demonstrated slower inference speeds compared to parallel generation models such as StarGAN-EVC. DurFlex-EVC, as a diffusion-based model, exhibited varying RTFs depending on the number of sampling time steps. With just four time steps, DurFlex-EVC achieved an RTF of 0.1334, significantly faster than all compared autoregressive models. At this setting, DurFlex-EVC maintained competitive performance and exceeded the speed and performance metrics of other autoregressive models. However, when using 100 time steps, DurFlex-EVC achieved the highest performance, though at a slower RTF of 1.9200 due to the increased computational demand of the diffusion process.\n\nFor a quantitative assessment of prosody, we also compared pitch and energy duration. Table  IV  shows the evaluation results for each emotion. We found that the proposed model scored better than the other models in all prosody evaluations.",

Fig.  6  shows the change in cross entropy for styles as input features pass through SAE. To obtain cross entropy, we trained a classifier for emotion style on features extracted from all layers of SAE. The black line is the result for the model with SAE and the orange line is the result for the model without SAE. The w/o SAE model shows high cross entropy across the layers, while the model with SAE shows increasing cross entropy as it passes through the de-stylize transformer layers and decreasing cross entropy as it passes through the stylize transformer layers. This means that the style is disentangled and conditioned from the feature by SAE. We also experimented with adversarial training strategies to remove source styles from input features. This replaces the de-stylize transformer in the style autoencoder with a standard transformer, and adds a gradient reversal layer and classifier to prevent its output from learning the style. This adversarial training strategy is often used to disentangle specific styles  [67] -  [69] .\n\nThe results for this are shown in Table V as w/ adv, and show a performance degradation on all metrics except EECS.\n\n2) Effectiveness of Unit Aligner: The unit aligner (UA) was introduced to model stylized contexts. Table V w/o UA shows the results of the ablation experiment for this. The results showed that w/o UA performed better in terms of voice quality and pronunciation but not in terms of emotion conversion. This indicates that there remains a lot of information about the source style in the features and that the UA functions as a bottleneck and has a significant impact on style control.\n\nWe measured the Jensen-Shannon divergence (JSD) to validate that the predicted units in UA reflect the target emotion. Table  VI  shows the JSD results of the units for each emotion in Textless-EVC and DurFlex-EVC.

The results of the ablation study without the HSE are shown in Table V under the entry labeled w/o HSE. The evaluation results showed an overall performance degradation with w/o HSE. This is inferred to be due to HSE reducing the burden on the Mel-spectrogram generator, resulting in improved generation    We introduced a stochastic duration predictor (SDP) for duration modeling to represent the diversity of emotions. To evaluate, we compared our method with widely used deterministic duration predictors (DDP). The DDP follows the structure described in FastSpeech  [24] , which includes two convolutional layers, ReLU activation, layer normalization, and dropout. Tables V, w/ DDP shows the evaluation results of the model using DDP. The evaluation results show that the model using SDP is better than the model using DDP. We compared the JSD of unit duration for each emotion for each duration predictor. Table  VII  shows the JSD results for unit duration for models with stochastic duration predictors, w/ SDP, and deterministic duration predictors, w/ DDP.\n\nIn our experiments, we found that DDP does not always output the same length when generating the same sentence with the same conditions. We discovered that it was caused by a dropout within the DDP. We experimented with repeatedly generating the same speech, and Fig.  7  shows a histogram of  Diffusion-based generators have been shown to produce highquality and diverse results in a wide range of domains. We introduced a diffusion-based structure to generate more expressive speech for each emotion. We conducted experiments to compare our decoder with a feed-forward transformer (FFT) based structure, which is widely used in conventional speech synthesis studies for parallel generation. Table V w/ FFT shows the objective evaluation results of the model using the FFT-based decoder. The w/ FFT scored better in CER and WER for pronunciation, but lower on UTMOS for quality, and worse on ECA and EECS for emotion expression.\n\nTo verify the expressiveness of each emotion, we computed the JSD over pitch for each emotion. In Table VIII, w/ FFT is the model using an FFT decoder and w/ diffusion is the model using a diffusion-based structure. w/ diffusion shows better JSD on neutral, angry, sad, while w/ FFT shows better JSD in happy and surprise. Although w/ FFT outscores w/ diffusion in Happy and Surprise, it does not mean that FFT is more  expressive. Fig.  8  shows the pitch of the speech generated by multiple iterations of the same sentence. Models using FFT produce consistent pitch tracks that remain stable over repeated generations, while models using diffusion produce more dynamic results. This suggests that the diffusion-based structure captures higher expressiveness, resulting in a higher JSD compared to the FFT-based structure, which tends to average over dynamic emotions like happy and surprise.",

To explain the reasoning behind our choice of HuBERT features, we present a comparison of the input features. We compared Mel-spectrogram and linear spectrogram as features using conventional signal processing, and wav2vec 2.0  [31] , wavLM  [70] , and HuBERT  [33]  as SSL features that have recently been used as linguistic representations  [35] ,  [71] .\n\nAlthough the input feature dimensions differ in each experiment, they are aligned to the same hidden dimension through a linear layer.\n\nTable  IX  shows the results of the experiments by input feature. The results show that models using Mel-spectrogram and linear-spectrogram have lower UTMOS than SSL feature models. Models using wavLM performed better overall than those using wav2vec 2.0. The model using HuBERT outperformed the others in all metrics except ECA and EECS. In particular, the model using HuBERT shows a significant improvement in pronunciation, which is interpreted as advantageous for linguistic learning over other features because the target units used for training are obtained from the clustering of HuBERT features. To compare the linguistic modeling ability of each input feature, we calculated the BLEU score  [72]  and the unit error rate (UER) of the predicted units. Table  X  shows the BLEU score and UER of the predicted units for each feature.  We found that the prediction of units was correlated with the pronunciation accuracy of the synthesized speech, and this was due to the fact that HuBERT predicted units more accurately than the other features.\n\nWe also experimented with a model that takes unit input and generates speech. In Table  V , w/ unit2mel is a model that receives unit input and generates Mel-spectrogram. This model has the same structure, with the addition of a unit embedding layer to accept units as input. Furthermore, we experimented with models that generate waveforms directly from unit. w/ unit2wav is a modification of HiFi-GAN  [48]  to take unit as input, which is equivalent to not including f0 in Textless-EVC generator.\n\nThe w/ unit2mel shows a worse overall performance, except for ECA and EECS. The w/ unit2wav shows significantly worse metrics across the board, except for CER and WER. We interpret this to mean that the speech unit has enough information about pronunciation but not enough other speech information to generate a waveform. To overcome this, Textless-EVC uses additional information such as pitch and timbre to generate the waveform.",

To make it possible, we modified the model structure to allow speaker information to encode speaker embedding from reference audio instead of speaker IDs. We adopt the style encoder structure from Meta-StyleSpeech  [73]  as the speaker encoder. We added a gradient reversal layer (GRL)  [74]  and a linear layer to prevent the speaker encoder from learning information about emotion. The linear layer performs the emotion classification task, where the losses are reversed by the GRL to prevent the speaker encoder from learning about emotion. Fig.  9  shows the speaker encoder and emotion embedding designed in this way to model style embedding. We set the weight for adversarial losses due to GRL to 0.001. We trained our model on the ESD dataset. For the unseen speaker test, we composed the test set by randomly selecting five sentences for each speaker from the VCTK dataset that were not used for training. We set the emotion of the test set to neutral and converted all other emotions. Table  XI  shows the evaluation results for seen and unseen speakers for the modified model. The modified model scored better UTMOS, PER, CER, and WER than the original version, while performing weaker on ECA, EECS, and SECS. We infer that the synthesis quality and pronunciation are better due to the additional information encoded from the reference audio that helps with speech synthesis. However, the lack of style disentanglement leads to decreased performance on emotion and speaker-related metrics. The results of the unseen speaker show that the modified structure allows for the emotion conversion of a new speaker without losing quality. Fig.  10  shows the pitch tracks of the transformed samples of the unseen speaker for each emotion, showing distinct differences for each emotion. We found that the speaker similarity for unseen speakers was lower compared to seen speakers. Table  XI  shows the speaker similarity for each emotion. We observe a decrease in the speaker similarity for all emotions.

The primary distinction in our approach lies in the utilization of the cross-attention output as the input for our model, rather than relying on the predicted units.\n\nWe designed our model to generate a Mel-spectrogram.

However, the limitations of diffusionbased structures include their extensive computational demand and time-consuming nature. We anticipate that this challenge will be alleviated by the advent of the recent fast sampling method  [76] . Some applications have been developed in speech research  [77] . The scope of our experiments also encompassed speaker generalization. Although we successfully observed emotional transformations in the voices of unseen speakers, a discernible lack of speaker similarity was apparent, indicating the need for further refinement. Empirically, our observations suggest that models tested on unseen data often reflect the voice distribution of the data used for their pretraining. Expanding the dataset is expected to increase the representational capacity of the generator, and the performance of zero-shot emotion conversion is also expected to improve.\n\nIn the configuration of our style autoencoder, we utilized MixLN for de-stylizing and CLN for stylizing. It was observed that the perturbations introduced by MixLN resulted in a compromise that affected the equilibrium between expressiveness and pronunciation accuracy within our model. In addition, the task of effectively separating style from content remains a significant challenge  [78] ,  [79] , requiring ongoing research and development to address this issue. Although the diffusion model produces high-quality speech, it has limitations due to emotion datasets typically having a 16k sampling rate. Audio super-resolution models, such as  [80] , are expected to solve this problem. Although we only experimented with English, our model has the potential to be extended by considering a wide range of languages and combining it with speech-to-speech translations  [81] .

Exploiting discrete speech units derived from HuBERT, our model encodes content at the unit level and allows flexible duration control by extending unit-level duration prediction to the frame level. We developed a style autoencoder to disentangle emotional style from content, allowing precise manipulation of target styles. Additionally, we introduced a unit aligner to model emotional context at the unit level. A hierarchical stylize encoder further enhances emotional expressiveness by refining style application at both unit and frame levels. To improve synthesis quality, we incorporated a stochastic duration predictor and a diffusion-based generator, ensuring naturalness and diversity in generated speech. Through extensive experiments, DurFlex-EVC demonstrated superior performance over existing models, excelling in both emotional reproduction accuracy and speech quality. The framework effectively generalized to unseen speakers, preserving pronunciation and emotional clarity. These results demonstrate its potential for advancing emotional voice conversion, particularly in applications requiring duration flexibility and expressive emotional transformations.",
