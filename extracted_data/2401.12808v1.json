      "text": "In the context of our research activities on affective computing and human-robot interaction we are working on both the recognition of human's emotions and the expression of emotions by robots. In our vision, robots will be increasingly present in schools, factories, and homes, and their empathetic behavior may foster their acceptance. In particular, in one of our research, we sought to replicate gestures associated with specific emotions on a social robot, NAO. Our focus was on Ekman's six primary emotions, along with five emotions selected from Plutchik's wheel of emotions. In our opinion the cultural component linked to the expression of emotions through gestures certainly influenced both us and the participants. Thus, we would like to investigate the influence of our culture in the gestural expression of emotion.",

      "text": "The results obtained are interesting, even if we must replicate the experiment other times, and with a different sample of users. In our opinion the cultural component linked to the expression of emotions through gestures certainly influenced both us and the participants. Italian gestures, renowned globally for their expressive qualities, often serve as an additional language that transcends linguistic barriers and have evolved into a distinct form of communication (see for instance  [15] ), sometimes used to express stereotypes of Italian culture  [5] . While undeniably essential in conveying emotions, it would be fundamental to discern whether they hold cross-cultural significance or are more culturally specific. It would be interesting to see if these gestures are more understandable and shareable in the Mediterranean culture outside Italy than in all other countries.\n\nItalian gestures witness the vibrant and passionate nature of the Italian people. Hand movements and facial expressions are typical of the Italian culture, and act as an extension of spoken language. This non-verbal communication emotionally enriches conversations with additional layers of meaning and nuance.\n\nHowever, the meaning of Italian gestures may be less understandable in cultures where verbal communication takes precedence  [11] . In societies where explicit verbal expression is used to convey emotions, elaborate gestures might be deemed redundant. In these contexts, emphasis is likely placed on word choice and tone rather than physical movements. Additionally, the understanding of Italian gestures could pose challenges in cross-cultural communication. While enhancing communication within Italian culture, these gestures might be prone to misinterpretation or overlook in different cultural settings, potentially leading to misunderstandings.\n\nWhile undeniably significant within the Italian cultural context, the universal applicability and relevance of these gestures in different cultures should be further investigated, as for instance in  [4] .\n\nHence, an interesting opportunity for further exploration could be replicating our study across Mediterranean countries to ascertain whether the emotions conveyed by our 'Italian' robot are similarly recognized in settings with cultural similarities. Subsequently, a comparative analysis of the results with a subsequent study conducted in a Northern European country could yield valuable insights.\n\nTo advance this research agenda, seeking collaboration with interested researchers during this workshop could be beneficial. Collaborative efforts would involve replicating the study in different cultural contexts, allowing for a comprehensive cross-cultural examination of the reception of emotions expressed by the robot.\n\nThis proposed cross-cultural approach not only enhances the generalizability of our findings but also provides an opportunity to discern cultural influences in the interpretation of robotic gestures. It opens a dialogue for potential cultural variations in the perception of emotional cues, contributing to a wider understanding of how humanoid robots may be accepted across diverse cultural landscapes.\n\nInitiating discussions and collaborations within the workshop setting could pave the way for a more extensive and comprehensive research attempt, making light on the cultural universality or specificity of our robot's emotional expressions.",
