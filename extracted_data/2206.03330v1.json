      "text": "Emotion plays a significant role in our daily life. Recognition of emotion is wide-spread in the field of health care and human-computer interaction. Emotion is the result of the coordinated activities of cortical and subcortical neural processes, which correlate to specific physiological responses. However, the existing emotion recognition techniques failed to combine various physiological signals as one integrated feature representation. Meanwhile, many researchers ignored the problem of over-fitting model with high accuracy, which was actually false high accuracy caused by improper pre-processing. In this paper, sigmoid baseline filtering is conducted to solve the over-fitting problem from source. To construct a physiologicalbased algorithm, a 3D spatial and functional brain mapping is proposed based on human physiological mechanism and international electrode system, which combines the signals of the central and peripheral nervous system together. By combining the baseline filtering, 3D brain mapping, and simple 4D-CNN, a novel emotion recognition model is finally proposed. Experiment results demonstrate that the performance of the proposed model is comparable to the state of art algorithms.",

      "text": "Positive emotion can improve our sense of happiness  [8] , while negative emotion may lead to health problems  [33] . Recently, emotion recognition has attracted more and more attention, especially in academic research.\n\nGenerally, two main approaches are adopted for human emotion recognition: One utilizes non-physiological signals, such as facial expression  [11] , intonation  [21] , and emotional vocabulary  [7] . The another one utilizes physiological signals generated by the CNS and PNS (short for central and peripheral nervous system), including EEG  [19] , EOG  [3] , and PSR  [22] . As far as we are concerned, physiological signals are considered more reliable information, which reflect objective physiological variations of human emotion.\n\nHowever, many developed emotion recognition models focused on the accuracy but ignored the hidden problems in the preprocessing. Recently, a pre-processing method named base-mean, first proposed in a paper  [43] , was employed in many EEG-based emotional recognition research  [1, 3, 9, 23, 30, 40, 45] . Despite the fact that these models achieved high accuracy, it is further validated that this popular base-mean method results in a severe over-fitting problem which will finally lead to the unreliability of a model and false high accuracy. As validation, mathematical demonstration and experiment results are shown. To solve this over-fitting problem while following the idea of removing baseline effect, sigmoid baseline filtering in frequency domain is proposed.\n\nOn the other hand, there has never been a reliable and physiological-based algorithm to combine different physiological signals as an integrated representation. Some researchers only adopted EEG for emotion recognition  [14, 22] , some roughly combined EEG with other physiological signals after separate feature extraction  [3, 36] . To construct a highly reliable integrated feature representation, a 3D spatial and functional brain mapping algorithm is proposed in this paper, following the idea of cortical cartography  [13] . In this mapping algorithm, EEG signal is mapped as CNS signal by following the electrode system  [18] , and the selected peripheral physiological signals are mapped as PNS signals by coordinating the research results of functional brain divisions  [4, 10, 17, 20, 44] . Finally, a simple 4D-CNN is applied to extract features of CNS and PNS signals simultaneously on spatial, temporal, and functional dimensions.\n\nIn summary, the main contributions of this paper are as follows:\n\n(1) The over-fitting problem of the popular base-mean is revealed, and sigmoid baseline filtering is proposed to solve the problem.\n\n(2) The CNS and PNS signals are integrated into one 3D representation for the first time, by applying the proposed spatial and functional brain mapping based on physiological research results and international electrode system.\n\n(3) Extensive comparative experiments on DEAP and SEED datasets are conducted to demonstrate that the proposed model has comparable or better performance in emotion recognition.",

Both CNS and PNS signals are discrete timing signals, which record electrical intensity varying with time.\n\nIn  [45] , Z-sore normalization was implemented to normalize values per frame. In  [3] , different temporal window sizes were compared for EEG and EOG signals. Different band pass filtering in frequency domain were applied in  [25, 37, 43] . Besides that, one pre-processing with baseline called base-mean, proposed by Yang in  [43] , stood out for its high accuracy. This base-mean method tends to remove baseline effect in raw EEG signals. But it also unintentionally results in a high similarity problem, an over-fitting model, and the false high accuracy result. To overcome the above overfitting problem while following the idea of baseline effect removal, the sigmoid baseline filtering in frequency domain is proposed.",

      "text": "The emotional features in CNS and PNS signals can be extracted on three dimensions: spatial, temporal, and functional. Many researchers focused on spatial or temporal dimension and proposed various methods of feature representation and extraction, but very few of them made the best of PNS signals on the functional dimension.\n\nOn temporal dimension, CNS and PNS signals are time-series data in essence. So, many models were aimed at constructing and extracting temporal features. ACRNN in  [35]  was based on RNN and self-attention mechanism. Scaling-Net in  [16]  deployed convolution layers to extract temporal features. FAWT-RF in  [14]  transformed data to frequency domain for noise reduction and emotion classification.\n\nOn spatial dimension, emotional features also exist in the complex correlations between different EEG channels. To reconstruct the relative positional relationships of EEG signals, the form of 2D image series was put forward. Then, different interpolation algorithms were applied to further reconstruct the missing information  [32, 38] . Meanwhile, high-level spatial features were also revealed: Symmetric features were extracted by combining different ways of folding  [30] , and deeper relationships between adjacent channels were revealed by using dynamic and graphic EEG representation  [5] .\n\nOn functional dimension, the multi-modal data can be adopted as auxiliary signals with EEG in emotion recognition task. Multimodal data or peripheral physiological signals include EOG, EMG, GSR and so on  [19] , which reflect objective variations of human physiological function. However, existing models with multi-modal data failed to take CNS and PNS signals as an integrated feature representation  [31, 36] . In our proposed model, CNS signals and PNS signals are merged in 3D cuboid series using spatial and functional mapping, which maximizes the potential of all physiological signals.",

      "section_name": "Strengths And Weaknesses Of Base-Mean Pre-Processing.",
      "text": "Base-mean pre-processing is a simple and effective method to remove the baseline effect or the resting state in EEG signals. But it also results in extra similarity between training set and test set, which leads to an over-fitting model with false high accuracy result.\n\nThe strengths of base-mean are its simplicity and effectiveness of removing baseline effect in raw EEG data. As to simplicity, the base-mean only contains simple shape transformation and common mathematical operation. As to effectiveness, many models achieved very high accuracy by using base-mean method: The accuracy of LSTM-CNN in  [43]  improved greatly to 97.8%, 91.03% for arousal and valence classification. Additionally, other models using basemean method also achieved very high accuracy: 96.61%, 96.43% in 3D-CNN  [45] , and 94.22%, 94.58% in 4D-Attention  [40] ).\n\nThe major weaknesses of base-mean method are the similarity and over-fitting problems. Crucial steps of base-mean are explained below. In the beginning, the Base-Mean and Raw-EEG matrices of the same shape are the results of splitting and taking elementwise mean values of the EEG data. Then Base-Removed matrices are equal to subtraction of Raw-EEG with Base-Mean. On the surface, the subtraction is considered as removal of baseline effect. But actually, it is also a way of baseline marking, as the homologous Raw-EEG matrices, which correspond to the same emotion label, are marked by the same Base-Mean matrix. Thus, similarity between homologous Base-Removed matrices increases for their same baseline feature. Then, the random shuffling separates homologous Base-Removed matrices into a training set and test set randomly. Finally, the extra baseline marking can be learned easily by the neuron network, which leads to over-fitting and false high accuracy.\n\nIn Table  2 , the results validate the existence of the high similarity problem and the baseline marking. On the one hand, base-mean indeed removes the baseline effect, for the similarity within homologous Base-Removed matrices actually increased compared to Raw-EEG. On the other hand, the notable increase of similarity between Base-Removed and Base-Mean validates the existence of baseline marking.\n\nwhere A and B represents two matrices of the same shape, m and n represents number of channels and frames per data, cov represents the covariance, and 𝜎 represents standard deviation.\n\nIn Table  1 , the results of DT, KNN, and SVM are listed, showing the severe over-fitting problem and false high accuracy by using base-mean method. The 1st and 2nd rows show that the accuracy is very high even with minimal training ratio by using base-mean, which is usually a sign of over-fitting. The 2nd, 3rd, and 4th rows show that the model using base-mean actually learned a lot from the baseline features in the homologous Base-Removed matrices. The 5th and 6th rows show that the severe over-fitting results by using base-mean in the way of replacing EEG data with randomvalued but normalized data. All these results prove that base-mean pre-processing leads to over-fitting and false high accuracy.\n\nIn the table, Raw represents EEG data without base-mean preprocessing, Random represents usage of random-valued but normalized matrices, and Split (ratio) represents ways of train-test-split and the training set ratio. Splitting by data means dividing the homologous matrices generated from one original data all to the training set or all to the test set, whereas the splitting by index means randomly dividing the homologous matrices from one original data between the training and test set based on the exact ratio. The over-fitting problem of base-mean stems from dealing with different homologous Raw-EEG matrices by subtracting them from the same Base-Mean matrix. To solve the high similarity and overfitting problem from source, the sigmoid baseline filtering is conducted in frequency domain, following the idea of baseline effect removal, multiple band-pass filter, and echo reduction in multiple microphone audio system.  [12, 39] . The filtering mainly contains two steps: First, convert data to frequency domain and quantify the baseline effect; Second, remove the baseline effect and convert data back to time domain.\n\nThe raw data are divided into Base-Mean and Raw-EEG matrices, which are transformed into frequency domain by using Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) as follows,\n\nwhere R and B represents the Raw-EEG and Base-Mean matrices, while RT and BT represents Raw-EEG and Base-Mean matrices after FFT.\n\nThen, the baseline influence can be measured by the difference between the values of RT and BT, forming the Deactivate-Filter matrices which are calculated as follows,\n\nwhere D represents Deactivate-Filter matrix containing quantified value of baseline effect in every Raw-EEG matrix. Sig means the sigmoid function which softens the result. Notice that Deactivate-Filter is computed differently even for homologous RT. So the high similarity problem is avoided, and the over-fitting problem is solved from source. Finally, the Filtered-EEG matrices are calculated using above RT, BT, and D matrices and transformed back to time domain, which is shown as follows,\n\nwhere F represents Filtered-EEG, symbol • indicates element-wise multiplication (Hadamard product). IFFT means Inverse Fast Fourier Transform (IFFT).\n\nTo summarize, the core idea of sigmoid baseline filtering is to remove baseline effect from every segment of raw EEG. Specifically, to lower the value of some frequencies in Raw-EEG, which have high intensity in Base-Mean. Unlike base-mean, the over-fitting problem is avoided from source for every homologous EEG segments are dealt with differently. The similarity comparison between matrices using sigmoid baseline filtering is shown in Table  2 .",

As for PNS signals selection, electrode placement system and functional brain division literature are referenced.\n\nOn DEAP dataset, there are 8 types of PNS signals: GSR, Respiration amplitude, Skin temperature, Blood volume by plethysmograph, Electromyogram (EMG) of Zygomaticus and Trapezius muscles, and Electrooculogram (EOG) of vertical and horizontal. Peripheral signals with apparent brain division and close to emotion are preferentially chosen to be the final PNS signals.\n\nEMG is an auxiliary examination of some neurological and muscular diseases  [27, 29] . It reflects the health and excitability of nervous system related to muscle movement, which relates to motor cortex located in anterior central gyrus at the boundary of frontal and central lobes  [10] .  Respiration amplitude was adopted in many emotion-related studies, like feedback of Laughter  [15]  and sleep  [2] . The respiration center  [44] , which gives orders to respiratory muscles, is located in the medulla oblongata and pons, which is close to the bottom of brain.\n\nSkin temperature was also adopted in many emotional recognition tasks  [20] . The preoptic anterior hypothalamus (POAH) is the principal center for body temperature regulation  [17] , which is close to the center of brain.\n\nEOG records electrical signals of vertical and horizontal eye movements, which was essential in some emotion recognition models  [31] . Since many brain regions are involved with eye movement and human vision, two visual cortex in the frontal lobe and pariental lobe are both considered  [4] .\n\nGSR is short for Galvanic Skin Response. It is usually regarded as a measurement of perspiration, which reflects stress and surprise  [26] . Studies showed that GSR is related to arousal  [28] , but no corresponding brain region is found for GSR.\n\nElectrocardiogram was also adopted in the field of emotion recognition. But the existence of cardiac autonomic nervous means that heart functions quite independently, and there is no brain region specifically associated with it.\n\nBlood volume is an essential index in medicine. However, it is influenced by many factors in complex ways, so no specific brain region is related. Besides that, the correlation between blood volume and emotion is also not yet verified.\n\nAs mentioned above, EOG, EMG, Respiration amplitude, and Skin temperature are selected as PNS signals for further functional mapping.",
