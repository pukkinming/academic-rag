      "text": "Over the past decades, the addition of hundreds of sensors to modern vehicles has led to an exponential increase in their capabilities. This allows for novel approaches to interaction with the vehicle that go beyond traditional touch-based and voice command approaches, such as emotion recognition, head rotation, eye gaze, and pointing gestures. Although gaze and pointing gestures have been used before for referencing objects inside and outside vehicles, the multimodal interaction and fusion of these gestures have so far not been extensively studied. We propose a novel learning-based multimodal fusion approach for referencing outside-the-vehicle objects while maintaining a long driving route in a simulated environment. The proposed multimodal approaches outperform single-modality approaches in multiple aspects and conditions. Moreover, we also demonstrate possible ways to exploit behavioral differences between users when completing the referencing task to realize an adaptable personalized system for each driver. We propose a personalization technique based on the transfer-of-learning concept for exceedingly small data sizes to enhance prediction and adapt to individualistic referencing behavior.

      "text": "As vehicles move towards fully autonomous driving, driving assistance functionalities are exponentially increasing, such as parking assistance, blind-spot detection, and cruise control. These features make the driving experience much easier and more enjoyable, which allows car manufacturers to design and implement numerous other additional features such as detecting eyes off-road using gaze monitoring, or enhancing secondary tasks while driving, such as music and infotainment control using mid-air hand gestures and voice commands. All these driving-and non-driving-related features require numerous sensors to work, such as external and internal cameras, gaze trackers, hand and finger detectors, and motion sensors. This enables researchers to design more novel features that could make use of the full range of available sensors, such as automatic music control using emotion recognition, and referencing objects (e.g., landmarks, restaurants, and buildings) outside the car. The latter feature is the focus of this paper. Selecting and referencing objects using speech, gaze, hand, and pointing gestures have been attempted in multiple domains and situations such as human-robot interaction, Industry 4.0, and invehicle and outside-the-vehicle interaction. Only recently did car manufacturers start implementing gesture-based in-vehicle object selection, such as the BMW Natural User Interface  [1]  using pointing, and outside-the-vehicle object referencing, such as the Mercedes-Benz User Experience (MBUX) Travel Knowledge Feature  [2]  using gaze. However, these features focus on single-modality interaction or limited multimodal approach where the second modality (usually speech) is used as event trigger only. This may deteriorate the referencing task performance during high-stress dynamic situations such as high-traffic driving or lane changing  [8, 11, 48] . While multimodal interaction is more natural and provides superior performance compared to single-modality approaches, it introduces inherent complexity and possesses multiple challenges, such as fusion techniques (e.g., Early versus Late Fusion  [9, 43, 47] ), translation, co-learning, representation, and alignment  [6, 7] . This has limited its use in previous systems, especially in complex dual-task situations where several modalities can be used in both tasks at the same time, such as infotainment interaction while driving.\n\nIn this paper, we explore several fusion strategies to overcome these challenges during the referencing task. Specifically, we focus on machine-learning-based approaches for personalized referencing of outside-the-vehicle objects using gaze and pointing multimodal interaction.",

      "text": "One-year-old infants learn to point at things and use hand gestures even before learning how to speak; hence, gestures are the most natural form of communication used by human beings  [49] . However, gesturing is not exclusive to hand movements; it can be done using face motion or even simple gazing. Therefore, researchers have attempted various approaches for controlling objects using symbolic hand gestures  [22, 38, 45, 52, 54] , deictic (pointing) hand gestures  [23, 25, 34] , eye gaze  [13, 24, 27, 31, 36, 37, 50, 51, 53] , and facial expressions  [3, 18, 46] . Specifically for the automotive domain, in-vehicle interaction has been attempted using hand gestures  [5, 16, 33, 40] , eye gaze  [36] , and facial expressions  [44] , while outside-the-vehicle interaction has been attempted using pointing gestures  [17, 41] , eye gaze  [24] , and head pose  [26, 30] . Although most of the previous methods focus on single-modality approaches while using a button or voice commands as event triggers, more recent work focused on multimodal fusion approaches to enhance performance. Roider et al.  [39]  used a simple rule-based multimodal fusion approach to enhance pointing gesture performance for invehicle object selection while driving by including passive gaze tracking. They were able to enhance the overall accuracy, but only when the confidence in the pointing gesture accuracy was low. When the confidence was high, their fusion approach would have a negative effect and lead to worse results. Similarly, Aftab et al.  [4]  used a more sophisticated deep-learning-based multimodal fusion approach combining gaze, pointing and head pose for the same task, but with more objects to select.\n\nWhile previous approaches, where both source and target are stationary, show great promise for in-vehicle interaction, they are not directly applicable to an outside-the-vehicle referencing task. This is because in this case, the source and the target are in constant relative motion. Moniri et al.  [32]  studied multimodal interaction in referencing objects outside the vehicle for passenger seat users using eye gaze, head pose, and pointing gestures and proposed an algorithm for the selection process. Similarly, Gomaa et al.  [19]  investigated a multimodal referencing approach using gaze and pointing gestures while driving and highlighted personal differences in behavior among drivers. They proposed a rule-based approach for fusion that exploits the differences in users' behavior by modality switching between gaze and pointing based on a specific user or situation. While both these methods align with the multimodal interaction paradigm of this paper, they do not strictly fuse the modalities together, but rather decide on which modality to use based on performance. They also do not consider time series analysis in their approaches, but rather treat referencing as a single-frame event.\n\nUnlike these previous methods, this paper focuses on utilizing both gaze and pointing modalities through explicit autonomous fusion methods. Our contributions can be summarized as follows: 1) we propose a machine-learning-based fusion approach and compare it with the rule-based fusion approaches used in previous methods; 2) we compare an early fusion approach with a late fusion one; 3) we compare single frame analysis with time series analysis; 4) we utilize individuals' different referencing behavior for a personalized fusion approach that outperforms a non-personalized one.",

We used OpenDS software  [29]  with a steering wheel, pedals, and speakers for the driving simulation; a state-of-the-art non-commercial hand tracking camera prototype specially designed for in-vehicle control for pointing tracking; and SMI Eye Tracking Glasses 1 for gaze tracking. For the driving task, we used the same 40-minute five-conditions star-shaped driving route with no traffic and a maximum driving speed of 60 km/hour as Gomaa et al.  [19] . The five counterbalanced conditions were divided into two levels of environment density (i.e., number of distractors around the Points of Interest (PoI)), two levels of distance from the road (i.e., near versus far PoI), and one autonomous driving condition. PoIs (e.g., Buildings) to reference are randomly located on the left and right of the road for all conditions and signaled to the driver in real-time. Drivers completed 24 referencing tasks per condition with a total of 124 gestures. These conditions were selected to implicitly increase the external validity of the experiment and the robustness of the learning models, however, there were not explicitly classified during model training. Finally, the PoIs' shapes and colors were selected during a pre-study to subtly contrast the surroundings and a pilot study was conducted to tune the design parameters.\n\nWe recruited 45 participants for the study. Six were excluded: one due to motion sickness and failure to complete the entire route, another due to incorrectly executing the task, and the other four due to technical problems with the tracking devices. The remaining 39 participants (17 males) had a mean age of 26 years (SD=6). Thirtytwo participants were right-handed while the rest were left-handed.  Early fusion is an end-to-end machine learning approach while late fusion requires pre-processing the pointing and gaze modalities first, and extracting final horizontal angles for both using the approach in  [19] .",

The three clusters are \"Participants with high pointing and high gaze accuracy\", \"Participants with high pointing and low gaze accuracy\", and \"Participants with low pointing and low gaze accuracy\"; there were no participants with high gaze and low pointing accuracy. Then, pointing and gaze input features are considered for each cluster of participants separately when applying the early fusion method to predict the GT angle.

Due to the small size of the training dataset, we use a small number of layers for the neural network implementation to reduce the number of learnable parameters; the FCNN network consists of three hidden layers of size 32, 16, and 8 respectively, while non-linearity is introduced using the rectified linear unit (ReLU) activation function, and the 1D CNN network consists of one hidden convolutional layer of 64 filters and a kernel size of 3. Lastly, the LSTM network consists of one hidden layer having 50 hidden units. The output layer for all types of networks is a fully connected layer of output one and a linear activation function to work as regressors.

For instance, a user might point at the edge of a wide building with a higher MSE than when pointing at the edge of a tall, narrow building. Therefore, we define another metric relating to the PoI width for performance comparison along with the RMSE.",

      "text": "Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) relates directly to the output angle. Figure  6  further illustrates this RMSE metric. The machine learning model attempts to predict a fused angle of pointing and gaze (𝜃 𝑝𝑟𝑒𝑑𝑖𝑐𝑡𝑒𝑑 ) as close to the PoI center (i.e., ground truth) as possible. The difference between the predicted angle and the ground truth angle (𝜃 𝑒𝑟𝑟𝑜𝑟 ) is calculated for each data point and squared; then, the mean of all 𝑁 square errors is calculated, which results in the MSE. Finally, the RMSE is simply the square root of the MSE, which produces an average estimation of prediction error in degrees as seen in Equation  1\n\nFor example, if the resultant MSE of our prediction is 225, it means that the average error of the model prediction (i.e., RMSE) is 15 degrees away from the center of the PoI, so if we assume that we have a PoI's angular width of 40 degrees in visual space, it means that our model already predicts a referencing angle completely within the PoI. Note that a limitation of the RMSE metric is that it does not differentiate between positive and negative offset since it is squared during the MSE calculation. So, this 15-degree average error could be to the left or the right of the PoI center. which we, in theory, could assess our model performance. However, when interpreting this error, caution must be taken, since larger error values have a more severe impact for far PoIs versus near ones as far objects have much lower angular width (𝜃 𝑤𝑖𝑑𝑡ℎ ) compared to closer objects. Thus, a relative metric would better describe the performance in comparison to an absolute one. Consequently, we introduced the Relative Distance-agnostic Error (RDE) metric, which divides the difference between the predicted angle and the ground truth angle (𝜃 𝑒𝑟𝑟𝑜𝑟 ) by half of the angular width ( 𝜃 𝑤𝑖𝑑𝑡ℎ 2 ) of the PoI on the screen at this time instance (since the vehicle is moving, the angular width changes with time). The resulting value then describes the error in multiples of half the PoI's width at each time instance. Thus, the MRDE is the average of the RDE for all 𝑁 time instances (i.e., data points) as seen in Equation  2 . Consequently, values less than one denote that the pointing vector lies within the PoI, while values larger than one denote that the referencing vector is outside the PoI's boundaries.",

Early fusion using the SVR model is superior to using the FCNN model for both RMSE and MRDE values with a relative average of 2.91% and 8.75% respectively. Additionally, both pointing and gaze single-modality prediction using SVR is on average more accurate than using FCNN for both RMSE and MRDE by 4.57% and 13.14% respectively. Since the entire training dataset consists of only 3596 data points (i.e., 29 participants with 124 data points per participant), we attribute the superiority of SVR over FCNN to the small dataset size in our use case. This is because deep neural networks generally require more data (even for the shallow FCNN used), but this remains to be tested in the future. Finally, the figures show a comparison between early fusion and hybrid fusion approaches. Fusion clusters (including high pointing accuracy, high gaze accuracy, or both) outperform the \"no GMM clustering\" approach for RMSE and MRDE by an average of 33.71% and 3.38% respectively, while the cluster where both modalities performed poorly (i.e., low pointing and low gaze accuracy) is degraded by 49.80% and 43.45% respectively. Moreover, for all clustering and no clustering cases, fusion models achieve better performance than single-modality ones. This means that the fusion model works better than the single best modality and does not get degraded by the other modality, unlike the rule-based fusion model in  [39]  that degrades with high pointing accuracy.\n\nNo  Fusion versus Hybrid Early fusion approach when using the SVR algorithm or FCNN against single modalities. The results are calculated using the \"middle pointing and first gaze\" frame selection method.\n\n5.1.3 Time Series Analysis using CNN and LSTM. Since both the CNN and LSTM algorithms require temporal information, the \"all pointing and all gaze\" frame selection method is used in analyses for both CNN and LSTM models as well as the previous SVR model for comparison. Figure  9a  and Figure  9b  show the results for these analyses while comparing the early fusion model to the hybrid fusion model as in the previous section. From the figures, it can be seen that while the temporal approach methods (i.e., CNN and LSTM) are almost equivalent for all cases in both RMSE and MRDE metrics, they are quite different from the non-temporal one (i.e., SVR). Although temporal models are slightly superior to the nontemporal model for RMSE values (Figure  9a ) with an average of 3.26%, they are inferior in terms of MRDE values (Figure  9b ) by an average of 7.33%, which suggests that a non-temporal approach is still the optimum approach. We hypothesize that the reason for that could also be the small dataset size, or it might be due to the fact that the temporal information for this task is too noisy or redundant to be useful for the fusion.",

Figure  10a  and Figure  10b  show the RMSE and MRDE results for the PM with the effect of this sampling weight, respectively, and they compare the PM to the UBM. It can be seen that the PM is superior to the UBM even if the personalized participant training data points (i.e., personalized samples) are weighted one-to-one with the other training participants' training data points (i.e., UBM samples); however, when giving more weight to the personalized participants' samples, the model adapts to the test data of these participants until we reach a point where the model starts overfitting and it does not perform well for this participant and the others. This point can be seen around a sampling weight ratio of one-to-fifteen in both Figure  10a  and Figure  10b , which shows a relative average enhancement for PM over UBM by 7.16% and 11.76% for RMSE and MRDE respectively. To further prove the personalization effect, it is tested against other participants that the model has not been personalized or adapted for. It can be seen from the same figures that, on average, PM works best for the personalized participant for all values of sample weight, with the largest gap around the oneto-fifteen optimum point. Further analysis on participants' level shows that at least 70% of the participants conform to these average figures and their referencing performance enhances with personalization. In conclusion, while there could be other personalization techniques that would enhance the referencing task performance further, these results show that our suggested PM outperforms a generalized one-model-fits-all approach.",

      "text": "From Equation  2 , we defined relative distance-agnostic error as the division of the difference between the predicted angle and the ground truth angle (𝜃 𝑒𝑟𝑟𝑜𝑟 ) by half of the angular width ( 𝜃 𝑤𝑖𝑑𝑡ℎ 2 ). However, it was noticed that at the middle frame of pointing, most of the buildings have very small angular widths (𝜃 𝑤𝑖𝑑𝑡ℎ ). Additionally, it was noticed that participants' average ground truth angle (𝜃 𝐺𝑇 ) at the middle pointing frame was ±9.8 degrees (i.e., 9.8 degrees to the left or the right) and the ninety percent quantile of the ground truth angle was ±17.3 degrees. This means that most of the time participants did not wait for the building to get closer (a close building angle being around 35 to 45 degrees) and pointed rather quickly as soon as they identified it on the horizon. This is also confirmed by the average pointing time of 3.69 seconds reported in  [19] , which shows that the users point quite quickly when the building appears, rather than waiting, even though the building remains in their view for approximately 20 seconds.\n\nTo leverage from this observation, a slightly modified task was created removing the pointing attempts whose ground truth exceeded ±17.3 degrees (i.e., the 90% quantile threshold) from the dataset and analyzing only pointing at faraway buildings, since pointing at close buildings corresponds to only 10% of this dataset and might not be representative. Then the PM's average RMSE and MRDE values are enhanced from 14.53 and 1.81 respectively (for the original task) to 5.45 and 0.544 respectively (for the modified far-pointing only task). This could be evidence that users attempt to point more accurately and gaze more precisely when referencing faraway objects to identify them, while they tend to be less accurate and more careless when pointing at near objects. In a real car environment, this observation is quite useful, since the surrounding world is captured using the car exterior camera and PoI angular width and distance can be easily identified. Moreover, the data was further split based on the ±9.8 average pointing angle to compare the pointing behavior at very faraway buildings (below this average angle) and faraway buildings (above this average angle). The RMSE and MRDE values for both those cases were: 4.83 and 0.64 for the very far case, and 6.67 and 0.63 for the far case. This shows a correlation between the distance of the object from the user and the referencing behavior which supports the previously mentioned hypothesis that users point more accurately at more distant buildings as seen from the better RMSE value.",

      "text": "Participants behave quite differently in multimodal interaction when referencing objects while driving. While previous work (such as  [19] ) showed pointing and gaze behavior and discussed the differences in users' pointing behavior quantitatively and qualitatively towards modality fusion, they did not investigate the implementation of the fusion model itself. In this paper, we focus more on leveraging this information and the implementation of a multimodal fusion model using both pointing and gaze to enhance the referencing task. We also compare such generalized models to a more user-specific personalized one that adapts to these differences in user behavior. Several machine learning algorithms have been trained and tested for the multimodal fusion approach and compared against the single-modality one. Also, different frame selection methods have been studied to assess the effect of time-series data on the performance when compared to single-frame methods.\n\nUBM results show that, on average, a multimodal fusion approach is more suitable than a single modality approach. They also show that a machine learning-based approach works better than deep learning, and time series analysis does not add much enhancement in performance compared to single-frame methods. However, this could be an artifact due to the dataset's small size, which we shall address in future work with longer experiment durations to collect more data. As for the personalization effect, non-weighted PMs show a slight enhancement over the UBM, which could be attributed to the low contribution ratio of the participants' data points. On the other hand, weighted PMs show a large enhancement in the referencing task performance for that participant due to the emphasis on their data points (i.e., individual behavior).\n\nFinally, the proposed fusion models, frame selection methods, and PM approaches enhance the referencing performance in comparison to both single-modality models and UBM. However, some aspects, like different pointing behavior based on the relative distance of the object to the user, are obscured through averaging over all data points, and this is not addressed in this study. In future work, these aspects require additional studies tailored towards this goal and further investigation to find a more concrete interpretation.",
