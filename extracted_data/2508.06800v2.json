Conventional approaches typically address this issue through missing modality reconstruction. However, these methods fail to account for variations in reconstruction difficulty across different samples, consequently limiting the model's ability to handle hard samples effectively. To overcome this limitation, we propose a novel Hardness-Aware Dynamic Curriculum Learning framework, termed HARDY-MER. Our framework operates in two key stages: first, it estimates the hardness level of each sample, and second, it strategically emphasizes hard samples during training to enhance model performance on these challenging instances. Specifically, we first introduce a Multi-view Hardness Evaluation mechanism that quantifies reconstruction difficulty by considering both Direct Hardness (modality reconstruction errors) and Indirect Hardness (cross-modal mutual information). Meanwhile, we introduce a Retrieval-based Dynamic Curriculum Learning strategy that dynamically adjusts the training curriculum by retrieving samples with similar semantic information and balancing the learning focus between easy and hard instances. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate that HARDY-MER consistently outperforms existing methods in missing-modality scenarios.

      "text": "Multimodal Emotion Recognition (MER) with missing modalities has emerged as a critical research direction in affective computing  [18, 24, 34, 37, 38, 44, 52] . In real-world scenarios, missing modalities frequently occur due to device failures  [32, 33, 38, 55] , asynchronous signals  [19, 30] , or low-quality inputs (e.g., degraded videos)  [42, 51] . However, most existing models are trained on complete-modality data, leading to poor performance under missing conditions and limiting their robustness in practical applications.\n\nTo mitigate these challenges, researchers have explored various methods and achieved significant progress  [5, 6, 18, 35, 51, 55] . Among these efforts, mainstream methods focus on reconstructing missing modalities using available modalities  [23, 52, 55, 58] . For instance, Zhao et al.  [55]  proposed an imagination network to recover missing modalities and to learn the joint representation. Yuan et al.  [52]  employed a diffusion model framework, leveraging available modalities to guide the generation of missing modalities and integrating the generated results with available information as a joint representation. Liu et al.  [23]  further improved the reconstruction process using modality-invariant features to strengthen model robustness under incomplete inputs.\n\nDespite recent advances, a critical limitation remains: conventional methods treat all training samples equally, overlooking the varying difficulty of reconstructing missing modalities across different instances, as illustrated in Fig.  1(a) . This homogeneous training strategy fails to acknowledge that certain samples are inherently harder to reconstruct due to factors such as semantic ambiguity, low signal quality, or strong inter-modal dependencies. Consequently, models tend to overfit on easy samples while underexploiting harder  ones, ultimately limiting their ability to generalize and adapt to complex real-world scenarios  [57] .\n\nTo address this limitation, we draw inspiration from educational psychology  [3] , where students often perform more exercises on harder concepts to enhance their understanding. Motivated by this strategy, we retrieve semantically similar examples for hard samples and integrate them into training, thereby encouraging the model to focus more on these challenging instances. We call this novel framework Hardness-Aware Dynamic Curriculum Learning, termed HARDY-MER. To achieve this, we mainly need two key functions: hardness measurement and hardness-aware training. First, we develop a Multi-view Hardness Evaluation mechanism that quantifies hardness based on two criteria: direct hardness, measured by reconstruction errors across modalities, and indirect hardness, assessed through mutual information between modalities. This dual-perspective evaluation enables a more comprehensive and accurate hardness assessment. Second, to prioritize harder examples during training, we propose a Retrieval-based Dynamic Curriculum Learning strategy. Specifically, we design a retrieval mechanism that fuses local similarities across available modalities into a unified global similarity score of the sample, which is then used to identify the most relevant candidate samples. The number of retrieved samples is then dynamically adjusted based on estimated hardness, allocating more training resources to harder samples while reducing emphasis on easier ones. The main contributions of this paper are as follows:\n\n• We propose a novel Multi-view Hardness Evaluation mechanism that jointly models direct and indirect hardness to facilitate comprehensive, modality-sensitive training hardness estimation.",

      "text": "Hard sample mining is a popular technique for enhancing a model's discriminative ability, widely applied in tasks such as face recognition  [28] , object detection  [31, 41] , speech separation  [40] , and masked image/audio reconstruction  [29, 39] , etc. Related studies have shown that hard samples frequently serve as model performance bottlenecks  [17, 36, 47] , and targeting these challenging instances can produce significant performance improvements  [21, 29, 39] . For example, Li et al.  [16]  utilized attention scores to pinpoint important instances from false negative bags, which were then used as hard negative instances to create hard bags, ultimately enhancing classification performance. Wang et al.  [39]  measured the reconstruction hardness of samples based on reconstruction error and performed masked reconstruction on image patches with higher reconstruction hardness to improve the model's ability to reconstruct masked images, thereby enhancing the robustness of visual representation learning. Tang et al.  [36]  proposed a teacherstudent framework with consistency constraints for multi-instance classification tasks. In this approach, the teacher model implicitly mines hard instances based on attention scores, which are then used to train the student model, enabling the student to learn better discriminative boundaries. However, when applied to multimodal tasks, traditional hard example mining methods face the following limitations: 1) Even when a modality is present in the input, its reconstruction hardness can still indicate whether its semantic information is redundant or complementary to other modalities  [18, 51] . A high reconstruction error for an observed modality suggests that the information it carries cannot be easily inferred from the others, thus making the sample intrinsically difficult for the model to learn. 2) Although single metrics such as reconstruction loss  [29, 39]  or attention scores  [36]  can be used to estimate sample hardness, they may not sufficiently capture the complexity of multimodal learning. In particular, these approaches often overlook the importance of crossmodal consistency  [9, 23] . Samples that are easy to reconstruct in individual modalities may still pose learning challenges when cross-modal consistency is weak  [20] .\n\nTo overcome the limitations described above, we propose a composite metric to comprehensively evaluate the learning hardness of multimodal samples. Specifically, our metric consists of two components: direct hardness, which intuitively reflects the sample's difficulty by assessing the reconstruction error of each modality; and indirect hardness, which measures the level of mutual information between different modalities, capturing the sample's challenge from the perspective of cross-modal consistency. By combining these two perspectives, the proposed metric provides a more comprehensive and reliable estimation of the hardness of the sample. This serves as a foundation for the subsequent retrieval of samples and the construction of the curriculum.",

This method equips pre-trained generative models with the ability to incorporate non-parametric memory, enabling them to effectively leverage external knowledge  [15] . In NLP tasks, RAG improves the quality of text generation by retrieving relevant documents  [2, 8, 11, 15, 48] . For example, Borgeaud et al.  [2]  proposed the Retrieval-Enhanced Transformer that enhances auto-regressive language models by conditioning on document chunks retrieved from a large corpus, based on local similarity with preceding tokens. Moreover, RAG has also been applied to dialogue generation tasks  [22] , where it is used to generate expressive speech that aligns with conversational styles. The traditional RAG method mainly focuses on directly incorporating the retrieved information into the generation process to improve output quality. In contrast, our approach enhances the training process by using retrieval techniques to find similar samples for challenging instances. Additionally, this is the first work to apply RAG technology to multimodal emotion recognition with missing modality.",

      "text": "Curriculum learning (CL) is a training strategy inspired by the structurally sequential learning approach in human education  [7, 49, 54] . Its core idea is to \"start small, \" using an easier subset of data to train the model, and then gradually incorporating more challenging data until the entire training dataset is covered  [1, 43, 46, 57] . Typically, curriculum learning utilizes a predefined  [54, 56, 57]  or automatically learned  [12-14, 29, 39]  difficulty predictor to distinguish between easier and harder samples, followed by a training scheduler that determines how to introduce the more challenging samples into the training process. CL not only accelerates the training process  [13, 27]  but also enhances the model's generalization capability  [45] . Recent extensive research has demonstrated the remarkable effectiveness of curriculum learning in fields such as computer vision  [45, 49] , human-object interaction detection  [57] , acoustic representation learning  [29] , etc. However, influenced by the \"easyto-hard\" training paradigm, traditional curriculum learning often prioritizes easy samples while inadequately addressing hard samples. Our method differs from these approaches in several notable aspects: 1) We innovatively integrate retrieval augmentation into curriculum learning, enabling semantic-aware instance expansion to enhance training sample diversity; 2) During retrieval, we incorporate sample difficulty signals to provide more semantically similar instances for challenging samples, therefore strengthening the model's capability to learn from hard cases. To the best of our knowledge, this represents the first approach that systematically unifies retrieval techniques with curriculum learning.",

Fig.  4  reports the Weighted Accuracy (WA) and Unweighted Accuracy (UA) under various modality conditions. Results show that using L2 distance for the text index (T-L2) consistently degrades performance, especially in text-only or text-involved settings (e.g., t, at, tv), highlighting the suitability of inner product for normalized textual embeddings. In contrast, switching to cosine similarity for acoustic (A-IP) or visual (V-IP) indexing reduces accuracy, with V-IP showing the most notable drop, particularly under visual-only input. These findings suggest that L2 distance is more effective for acoustic and visual features, which typically retain important magnitude information.",

      "text": "To improve sensitivity to hard samples and enhance robustness in missing-modality multimodal emotion recognition, we propose HARDY-MER, a novel framework that combines retrieval-augmented learning with curriculum learning. We introduce a multi-view hardness evaluation mechanism based on reconstruction errors and cross-modal mutual information, and design a Retrieval-based Dynamic Curriculum Learning strategy. This involves retrieving semantically relevant support samples from modality-specific feature banks, with retrieval quantity adaptively determined by sample hardness. The resulting hardness-aware curriculum guides model training. Experiments show HARDY-MER outperforms state-ofthe-art methods, and to our knowledge, it is the first to integrate retrieval and curriculum learning in this setting. Future work will explore extending HARDY-MER to large-scale pre-trained multimodal models for greater robustness under challenging conditions.",
