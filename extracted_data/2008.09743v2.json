      "text": "Considerable attention has been paid to physiological signal-based emotion recognition in the field of affective computing. For reliability and user-friendly acquisition, electrodermal activity (EDA) has a great advantage in practical applications. However, EDA-based emotion recognition with large-scale subjects is still a tough problem. The traditional well-designed classifiers with hand-crafted features produce poorer results because of their limited representation abilities. And the deep learning models with auto feature extraction suffer the overfitting drop-off because of large-scale individual differences. Since music has a strong correlation with human emotion, static music can be involved as the external benchmark to constrain various dynamic EDA signals. In this paper, we make an attempt by fusing the subject's individual EDA features and the external evoked music features. And we propose an end-to-end multimodal framework, the one-dimensional residual temporal and channel attention network (RTCAN-1D). For EDA features, the channel-temporal attention mechanism for EDA-based emotion recognition is first involved in mine the temporal and channel-wise dynamic and steady features. The comparisons with single EDA-based SOTA models on DEAP and AMIGOS datasets prove the effectiveness of RTCAN-1D to mine EDA features. For music features, we simply process the music signal with the open-source toolkit openSMILE to obtain external feature vectors. We conducted systematic and extensive evaluations. The experiments on the current largest music emotion dataset PMEmo validate that the fusion of EDA and music is a reliable and efficient solution for large-scale emotion recognition.

      "text": "The ability of emotion recognition is a significant hallmark of intelligent human-computer interaction (HCI). Empowering computers to discern human emotions better would make them perform the appropriate actions. In recent two decades, both the research groups and industries have aroused great interest that explores to enhance user experience with algorithms  [45] . With the advancement of sensor-based Internet of Things (IoT) technology, emotion recognition is in unceasing demand by a wide range of applications such as mental healthcare  [21] , driving monitor  [29] , wearable devices  [49] , etc.\n\nHuman emotions are usually defined as a group of affective states that evoke stimuli from external environments or interpersonal events as a response  [46] . According to behavioral researches, emotions are typically described as the set of discrete basic categories  [15] . They can also be represented in the continuous space  [22] , which can quantitatively describe the abstract emotion state percentage, which provides another method for understanding the concrete representations of abstract emotions. The valence-arousal space is one of the common emotion discrete spaces, where the valence reflects the value of the positive to negative state and the arousal measures the active to calm degree  [36] . For the advantage of conducting the Self-Assessment Manikins (SAM), most of the popular open-source emotion datasets applied the valence-arousal annotations, such as DEAP  [34] , AMIGOS  [12] , PMEmo  [63] , or etc.\n\nIn general, the data source of emotion recognition can be categorized into (1) peripheral physical signals such as facial expression  [33] , speech  [16] ; (2) physiological signals including electroencephalography (EEG), electrodermal activity (EDA), electrocardiogram (ECG), or etc. The first method has great advancement in data collection. However, it cannot guarantee reliability in recognition because human can consciously control body language to hide their personal emotionlike speech or facial expression. Using physiological signals can overcome this drawback. The physiological signals are reacted from the autonomic and somatic nervous systems (ANS and SNS). They are largely involuntarily activated and cannot be triggered by any conscious or intentional control  [28] . Thus, the physiological signal-based method provides an avenue to recognize affect changes that are less obvious to perceive visually  [28] . Compared with other physiological signals, the acquisition of EDA can be conveniently accomplished by intelligent wearable devices like smartwatches and wisebraves  [4] . The research of EDA-based emotion recognition can be put faster into practical applications such as emotion monitor  [43] , music liking recommendation  [11] , or etc. Hence, the EDA signal has great significance of scientific value and practicability.\n\nTo mine useful features from physiological signals, two broad methods exist: (1) the traditional well-designed methods with hand-crafted features, and (2) the deep learning models with auto feature extraction. According to previous studies, a wide range of statistical features have been explored to seek predictive power for the classification of emotions, including time domain, frequency domain, and time-frequency domain features  [53] . However, the hand-crafted feature-based methods suffer limitations in the following aspects. First, the traditional methods such as SCL have limited representation ability to extract the complicated EDA features from large-scale subjects. Second, the design of hand-crafted feature strongly depends on prior knowledge of statistics and physiology in the small-scale data. Researchers should take more and more effective hand-crafted features into account for better performance. It is a great challenge for their feature selection method. Although, Shukla  [53]  has provided a systematic exploration of the feature selection method, it cannot guarantee the robustness with large-scale complicated physiological signals.\n\nRecently, the effectiveness of deep learning model has been proven in tackling emotion recognition  [1] . Moreover, the end-to-end DNN model can directly learn discriminative features from data. Therefore, to involve less prior knowledge and explore the general solution for large-scale emotion recognition, we choose the end-to-end deep learning model. Compared with single subject, establishing the relationship between emotional state and the physiological signals with large-scale subjects is a challenging problem, because more subjects involve more complicated individual specificity. For emotion recognition with one subject, previous user-dependent system  [32]  has achieved more than 90% accuracy. However, when extending the subject from one to group, the accuracy of user-independent models decreased greatly  [28]  because of the individual specificity. Moreover, our experimental results in Section 5.2.1 have further supported this. Specifically, we use various hand-crafted classifier and CNN-based models to conduct incremental subject classification. In relatively small-scale datasets with dozens of subjects, such as DEAP (32 subjects), AMIGOS (40 subjects), and 1/10 PMEmo datasets (46 subjects), the models can build accurate relationships between EDA and emotion central states. However, when gradually increasing the subject number of PMEmo dataset to the maximum 457, the representation power of traditional classifiers with hand-crafted features is too weak to produce poor results, and the CNN-based deep learning model suffers overfitting. Since all those two mainstream methods have obvious defections, mining the single EDA single cannot further improve the performance for large-scale emotion recognition.\n\nTowards this, we consider fusing external features with EDA signals. The multimodal fusion has the great advantage to enrich the complementary information from different modalities  [5] . It has a broad range of successes, including multi-sensor management  [61] , and human-computer interaction  [27] . In the scene of psychological rehabilitation  [37] , or emotion tracing  [6] , music is commonly utilized medium because it is effective to modulate subject' s mood  [41] . In PMEmo dataset, music is what the authors use to induce emotions among participants. The tempo, beats, and other acoustic features regarding the music being played will correlate with the participants' observed emotions. Hence, we choose the music signal as the external constraint for supervised learning. As our experiments show, fusing the music features can efficiently improve the performance of RTCAN-1D and also overcome the defect that the EDA signal is relevant for arousal classification  [53, 57] .\n\nIn this paper, we propose RTCAN-1D, a novel end-to-end 1D residual temporal and channel attention network for emotion recognition in the valence-arousal dimension. We directly apply a 1D residual block to build the EDA residual feature extraction (RFE). To provide sufficient useful messages from 1-channel EDA, we apply the convex optimization-based EDA method  [20]  to decompose EDA into phasic, tonic components and feed the 3 channel mixed signals (origin, phasic, and tonic) into RTCAN-1D. Then, we involve the attention mechanism: (1) the signal channel attention module (SCA) to reweight the features of 3-mixed signal channels and (2) the residual nonlocal temporal attention module (RNTA) to explore the temporal correlations of EDA features. To the best of our knowledge, our model is the first attempt to involve the attention mechanism to process physiological signals We conduct extensive evaluations and compare our model with previous researches. Because the music and EDA signals from large-scale subjects are only available from the current largest PMEmo dataset, the multimodal fusion of RTCAN-1D is evaluated on PMEmo. Moreover, we prove the effectiveness of RTCAG with single EDA input from the small-scale DEAP and AMIGOS datasets. For a fair comparison with the SOTA methods, our proposed model was applied to the subject-independent binary classification of valence and arousal.\n\nIn summary, the contributions of our paper are represented as follows:\n\n• An end-to-end multimodal framework RTCAN-1D is proposed for user-independent emotion recognition. • The effectiveness of the attention mechanism is first proved to capture the channel-wise correlations and long-distance temporal information of EDA signals.\n\n• The fusion of individual specificity from EDA signals and external static benchmarks from music provides an efficient solution for large-scale emotion recognition.\n\nOur paper is organized as follows. Section 2 introduces literature and reviews related works. In Section 3, our proposed model is explained in detail. Experimental validations and result analysis are described in Section 4, along with the details of implementation. The slights and discussions are expressed in Section 5. Finally, we conclude this paper in Section 6 by summarizing the attributions and future prospects. Our codes have been released at https://github.com/guanghaoyin/RTCAN-1D.",

      "text": "When we focus on emotional recognition, the emotions should be quantitatively represented. Psychologists model the emotion in two types:  (1)  dividing the emotion into discrete classes and (2) using the multidimensional emotion space.\n\nThe discrete emotion representation uses several keywords to describe emotion rates. Plutchik  [47]  proposed a wheel model that includes eight basic emotions. In his model, the stronger emotions are in the center, while the weaker emotions are surrounded. More complex emotions can be formed by a mix of basic ones. Then, Damasio  [13]  categorised the emotions as primary (deriving from innate fast and responsive behaviour) or secondary (deriving from cognitive thoughts). Izard  [26]  extended to 10 basic emotions. However, the discrete description is unsuitable for analyzing complex emotions, because some mixed emotions cannot be precisely expressed in words.\n\nThe second mainstream presented a certain degree of specific emotional level in the multidimensional space of emotion. A first attempt was proposed by Wundt  [60] , where emotions were described in a pleasure-displeasure, excitement-inhibition, tension-relaxation 3D space. In 1979, Russell  [48]  postulated a two-dimensional model, spanned by the axes valence and arousal. The valence reflects the value of the positive or negative state, and the arousal measures the active or calm degree  [14] . Now, the V/A model becomes one of the most frequently employed model because it can be easily assessed using the Self-Assessment Manikins (SAM). The three affective datasets used in this paper are all measured by V/A space.",

      "text": "Multimodal information fusion technique is used to improve the performance of the system by integrating different information on the feature level, intermediate level, or decision level. To improve the robustness and performance of emotion recognition, previous researchers fuse the features from different physiological signals  [28, 32] , including ECG, RSP, EMG, EDA, and EEG because the fused signals contain more implicit information with the different sampling rate and more channels. But collecting multi-signals requires many conductive electrodes placed along the subject's scalp. The user-unfriendly acquisition limits practical applications. Therefore, some works added external media messages, which have a great relationship with human emotion. Kim et al.  [31]  systematically present the robust emotion recognition fusing the speech and biosignals. Liu et la.  [42]  combined the evoked video and EEG signals to predict the subject's emotional state. Koelstra et la.  [35]  combined the facial expression with EEG signals. And Thammasan et la.  [56]  fused the EEG and musical features. There is no effective exploration for the fusion of EDA and music signals, especially with large-scale subjects. Hence, our paper focuses on this issue.",

The approaches to process EDA signal include Bayesian Statistics  [53] , dictionary learning  [30] , and decomposition  [2] . We focus on the end-to-end general solution. Hence, complex processing is inappropriate. Therefore, we choose to decompose the EDA. The frequently used measurement of EDA is skin conductance (SC), which is composed of tonic, phasic components  [9] . The tonic phenomena (t) reflect slow drifts of the baseline level and spontaneous fluctuations in SC. The phasic phenomena (r) is generally a short-time rapid fluctuation and reflects the response to external stimulation  [9] . For realistic tasks, the measurement noise of equipment is also taken into consideration.\n\nThere have been several mathematical solutions associated with a stimulus for EDA decomposition in recent decades. Referring to Alexander 𝑒𝑡 𝑎𝑙 .  [2] , the well-known assumption is that the SC equals to the convolution between discrete bursting episodes of sudomotor nerve activity (SMNA) and biexponential impulse response function (IRF):\n\nThere exists some methods for EDA decomposition. Discrete deconvolution analysis (DDA)  [8]  claims the nonnegativity of the driver and maximal compactness of the impulses to decompose EDA through nonnegative deconvolution. Continuous decomposition analysis (CDA)  [7]  improves DDA with the IRF called Bateman function to conduct continuous decomposition. Convex Optimization-Based EDA Method (CvxEDA)  [20]  models the phasic, tonic, noise components and applies convex optimization to solve the maximum a posteriori (MAP) problem. CvxEDA provides a novel method to decompose EDA without preprocessing steps and heuristic solutions  [19] .",

      "text": "The great success of CNN frameworks depends on 2D convolution in signal processing and image domain  [23] . Our previous work  [62]  in EDA-based emotion recognition with the PMEmo dataset  [63]  also conducted 2D convolution. However, it is a detour to transform the 1D signal to 2D matrix just for fine-tuning pre-trained 2D CNN backbones. Moreover, if using the 2D convolution, the pre-precessing should be conducted to rearrange the 1D EDA sequences and transform them to 2D matrices as our previous work did  [62] , which is time-consuming and increases the computations. Accordingly, we directly use the 1D residual CNN framework to process EDA signals in this work.\n\nThe overall architecture of the proposed method is illustrated in Fig.  1 . Let the vector 𝑋 𝑇 = {𝑥 1 , 𝑥 2 , ..., 𝑥 𝑡 } be the input EDA sequence with 𝑡 points. 𝑌 𝑐𝑙𝑎𝑠𝑠 = {𝑦 1 , ..., 𝑦 𝑐 } denotes the ground truth for 𝑐-classes task. If the emotion state belongs to the 𝑖 𝑡ℎ class, 𝑦 𝑖 = 1 and 𝑦 𝑗 = 0 for 𝑗 ≠ 𝑖. Our goal is to establish the relationships between input EDA and emotion state, specifically decreasing the distance between ground truth label 𝑌 𝑐𝑙𝑎𝑠𝑠 and predicted result Ŷ𝑐𝑙𝑎𝑠𝑠 .\n\nFirst, after z-score normalization, we conduct CvxEDA decomposition. The normalized EDA signal (y) is composed of three N-long column vectors: the phasic (r) and tonic (t) signal plus the noise component (𝜀):\n\nwhere 𝑟 = 𝑀𝐴 -1 𝑝 and 𝑡 = 𝐵𝜆 + 𝐶𝑑. Then, with the transcendental knowledge of physiology and taking logarithmic transtorm, the MAP problem can be rewritten as a standard Quadratic-Programming (QP) convex form and can be solved efficiently using many available solvers (see more details in  [20] ). For denoizing in the process of solving optimization problem, we discarded the prior probability of noise term. After CvxEDA decomposition, the 1-channel EDA signal is expanded to mixed 3-channel signal\n\nAs shown in Fig.  2 , in order to reduce the computational complexity, we uniformly clip shallow feature to 3 parts and the clipped signals are subsequently fed into the residual temporal and channel attention group (RTCAG) with shared attention weights. The EDA feature vector is extracted by three parts: shallow feature extraction, attention module, and residual feature extraction. One convolutional layer extracts shallow feature 𝐹 𝑆𝐹 as\n\nwhere 𝐻 𝑆𝐹 (•) denotes convolution and batch-normalization operation. Then, the attention module reweights the shallow feature and focuses on more useful parts in temporal and channel-wise dimensions as  where 𝐹 𝐴 is rearranged feature and 𝐻 𝐴 (•) is the attention module respectively. To mine discriminative representations, we design the residual feature extraction (𝐻 𝑅𝐹 (•)) with ResNet-18 backbone  [23]  to output a EDA feature vector (𝐹 𝐸𝐹 ):\n\nIt should be emphasized that there exists other excellent CNN architectures such as VGG  [54] ,\n\nor DenseNet  [25]  to mine deep features, but a comparison of different CNN frameworks is not the focus of our research. To be specific, for dozens of people involved EDA dataset, the subjects' specificity is not so complicated that the RTCAN-1D can handle the single EDA input, which means\n\nFor the large-scale PMEmo dataset with hundreds of subjects, we fuse the EDA feature with an external static media feature (𝐹 𝑀𝐹 ). Under this circumstances, the full feature vector is the concatenation of EDA feature and media feature:\n\nFinally, 3 fully-connected layers followed with 3 ReLU functions, termed as (𝐻 𝐶𝐹 (•)), are fed with the full feature vector (𝐹 𝐹 𝐹 ) and output the classifying vector ( Ŷ𝑐𝑙𝑎𝑠𝑠 ) with the Softmax function Ŷ𝑐𝑙𝑎𝑠𝑠 = 𝑆𝑜 𝑓 𝑡𝑚𝑎𝑥 (𝐻 𝐶𝐹 (𝐹 𝐹 𝐹 )).\n\n(7)",

      "text": "For multichannel input, different channels make different contributions to a certain target. We involve a channel-wise attention mechanism to exploit the interchannel relationship and adaptively reweights them. It recently has been a hotspot in various researches such as image classification  [24] . By achieving high performance and robust to noisy inputs, the channel-wise attention mechanism is mobile and portable for different tasks. Referring to various channel-wise attention module, our SCA is adapted from the simplest structure of Squeeze-and-Excitation Block in  [24]  and replaces the convolution with 1D operation to fit signal inputs (see in Fig.  2(d) ). The multiplication operations of attention modules (seen in Fig.  2(c)(d) ) cause the unacceptable computational burden, especially with large feature maps. To improve the training efficiency, we consider to uniformly clip the long-temporal shallow feature to smaller groups in sequence dimension. The clipping method can reduce the length of each feature sequence, then reduce the computational complexity of multiplication for each forward propagation. In order not to involve more network parameters, we also didn't add the number of attention modules but use one module with shared parameters to recursively process the clipped parts. With sufficient GPU memory, this recursive process can also execute in parallel. The number of clipping parts is considerable because an inappropriate division leads to the large size for each clip, and the detailed division will cause the gradient and optimal issues for the SCA. Referring to  [14] , the EDA signal evoked from stimulations passes through a procedure of the latency, rise time, half recovery time. Although these intervals are not homogeneous in time, the physiological knowledge guides us to roughly divide the shallow feature to 3 parts in sequence dimension:\n\nwhere 𝐹 𝑆𝐹 ∈ 𝑅 𝐶×𝐿 and 𝐹 𝑆𝐹 1 , 𝐹 𝑆𝐹 2 , 𝐹 𝑆𝐹 3 ∈ 𝑅 𝐶×𝐿/3 . We first aggregate the temporal information from the clipped feature with the average-pooling operation to get the temporal average-pooled features 𝐹 𝐿/3 𝑎𝑣𝑔 . Then the descriptor is forwarded to a multilayer perceptron (MLP) with only one hidden layer. To reduce parameter overhead, the channel of average-pooled features through the hidden layer 𝑊 0 is decreased by the reduction ratio 𝑟 to 𝑅 𝐶/𝑟 ×𝐿/3 , then recovered by the latter layer 𝑊 1 . The sigmoid activation function generates the normalized channel attention weight 𝑊 𝑅 ∈ 𝑅 𝐶×𝐿/3 between 0 to 1. Finally, the original shallow feature is reweighted by the multiplication with the attention weight of the channel. Overall, the reweighted channel-wise feature is computed as\n\nwhere 𝑖 = 1, 2, 3 and\n\nis forwarded to the RNTA to mine temporal-range dependencies.",

      "text": "Nonlocal operation is first proposed as a neighborhood filtering algorithm in the image domain  [10] . It can involve the long-range position contribution to the filtered response of a certain position and control the contribution under the guidance of appearance similarity. At the advantage of capturing long-range relationships, the nonlocal neural network has been validated effective in video classification, object detection, instance segmentation, and keypoint detection  [59] . The great generality and portability motivates us to apply nonlocal operation in the recognition of psychological signals based emotions. However, as described in Section 3.2.1, the traditional attention module will multiply the computational complexity for large-size features. Therefore, the RNTA module performs a piecewise nonlocal operation. It takes the three parts of clipping features from the SCA as the inputs. Similar to the SCA, the RNTA is also trained recursively to reduce the model complexity.\n\nReferring to  [10, 59] , the generic nonlocal operation in deep neural networks can be defined as\n\nwhere 𝑥 represents the input feature map, 𝑖 is the target index of an output position in time sequence, and 𝑗 is the index of all possible locations which contribute to the filtered response x𝑖 In our module (seen in Fig.  2 (e)), we set 1D convolution operation and an average-pooling operation with kernel of size 1 to conduct linear embedding as\n\nFor pairwise function 𝑓 (•), there exists various formulations to the relationship between long-range indexes like Embedded Gaussian, Concatenation, or, etc. Wang 𝑒𝑡 𝑎𝑙 .

Specifically, we found that in small-scale datasets, the SCAs of residual blocks will increase the fitting ability of RTCAG-1D and cause the overfitting drop-off (seen in Section 5.3.2).

Different emotion thresholds result in the same V/A score totally mapping to the opposite emotional state between different subjects. It should be noted that we involved the subject threshold just for generating proper subject-specific emotional classes. The user-independent model should not focus on a specific individual user but deal with greatly varying individual differences. But it does not mean that we can ignore the subject specificity when recreating the binary label from the original dispersed annotation. When mapping the 1-9 annotations to the binary classes, previous work  [17]  simply discretized the annotations into low (≤5) and high (≥5) V/A states. The reference  [54]  points out that since the subjective ratings also possess the nonstationarity and subject specificity, the fixed threshold may not be suitable for all individual preferences. If we attempt to validate the generalization of our work in large-scale data, personal threshold generating subject-specific emotional classes is essential. Specifically, inspired by the strategy in  [17]  for binary classification, we calculate the subject's emotion threshold with discrete annotations as the four-steps procedure. The example of one subject (Subject-ID: 10031 from PMEmo) is shown in Fig.  3 . The statistics of each class after label recreation is shown in Table  1 . It validates the relabeled processing will not cause imbalanced label distribution.",

However, the results reported by  [12, 18, 53]  show that the classification performance for the valence and arousal dimensions does not diverge considerably. Shukla et al.  [53]  reveals that the subject preferences of V/A annotation scores greatly influence the gap of V/A performance. In the specific dataset, the subject tends to annotate the valance score associated with arousal score, where the correlations of V/A scores are high. To systematically analyze the experiment results in Section 5.2, we should first analyze the annotation correlations in DEAP, AMIGOS, and PMEmo datasets. Following  [53] , we calculate the Spearman correlation coefficient 𝑟 between the valence and arousal annotations. The significant test of p-Value is also conducted. The statistics are listed in Table  2 . Compared with DEAP dataset (𝑟 = 0.15), there are relatively higher correlations (𝑟 = 0.56/0.52) between the annotated arousal and valence scores of AMIGOS and PMEmo with the strong p-value evidence (𝑝 ≤ .001). It means the valance annotations in those two datasets have been influenced by arousal annotations.\n\nFor DEAP dataset, the subject has no preference to annotate the valence scores associated with arousal annotations. The characteristics of annotation can explain that our RTCAG with single EDA delivers the accurate valence recognition with AMIGOS and PMEmo datasets, and the performance of valence variable is much lower than arousal one in DEAP dataset. For the multimodel fusion of RTCAN-1D, the involvement of music overcomes the defect of EDA signals to achieve high performance in both the valence and the arousal dimensions.",

      "text": "To prove the efficacy of the proposed multimodal structure, we should first prove that useful EDA characteristics can be extracted by our RTCAG. The single EDA recognition is conducted in three datasets, including DEAP, AMIGOS, and PMEmo. After being pre-processed, the composed 3-channel signals were fed into RTCAG, and the series liner layers classified the EDA feature vectors. The subjects are gradually increased from 10% to 40%, 70%, and 100%. It's clear that there is an significant drop-off from 10%to 40% subject percent and the decrease becomes gentle from 40% to 100%.\n\nThe results of our RTCAG in DEAP, AMIGOS, and PMEmo are listed on the 1st, 2nd, and 14th rows of Table  3 . It is clear that our model has accomplished accurate recognition in DEAP and AMIGOS, which proves the EDA feature extraction of RTCAG is excellent. Moreover, because of the annotation correlations, the results for V/A dimensions in AMIGOS and PMEmo are relatively close, and the performance in DEAP diverges considerably, which is aligned with the dataset characteristics in Section 4.3. However, the performance in the large-scale PMEmo decreases 10% with the increase in the number of participants, which intrigued us. Previous works of neural networks  [38, 39, 55]  reveal the DNN models, especially deeper models with large parameters, may suffer overfitting when the inputs are complicated from various different domains. Considering the various subject specificity, we assume the RTCAG may suffer overfitting.\n\nTo validate our assumption, we conduct an incremental subject experiment. The subjects from PMEmo are gradually increased from 10% to 40%, 70%, and 100%. The benefit of hand-crafted features is that they have been shown to be stable by a variety of studies  [53] . To systematically evaluate our model we add the traditional SVM classifier with time domain, frequency domain, and time-frequency domain features hand-crafted The 128 statistical features are calculated with the methods of  [53] . And we refer to  [12]  to set the regularization parameter 𝐶 of the linear SVM as 0.25. Because the RTCAG is well-designed for 3-channel EDA signals, we wonder if the simple CNN with EDA feature engineering may suffer less over-fitting. Hence, we add another model in which the 128 statistical features are fed into a 3 layers CNN. The basic convolution layer of simple CNN keeps the same with RTCAG. Keeping the same training settings, the results of three models are shown on the 3rd row to 14th row of Table  3  and illustrated in Fig  4 .\n\nAccording to the results with single EDA input, we can make some analyses: (1) for RTCAG, when the number of subjects (PMEmo-10%) is small, the recognition accuracies of RTCAG are competitive to DEAP and AMIGOS. When the involved subjects increase to hundreds, the recognition results decrease drastically. More individual specificity cannot help the model to converge but cause the RTCAG to overfit. (2) For 3 layers CNN with hand-crafted features, the model also suffers overfitting, but the decrease is not as sharp as RTCAG. It reveals that the EDA signals from hundreds of subjects are indeed complicated to cause overfitting even processed with feature engineering. On the other hand, the performance of 3 layers CNN is poorer than RTCAG, which means simpler architecture and fewer parameters limit the performance of CNN model. (3) As shown in Fig.  4 , the advantage of traditional SVM classifier with hand-crafted features is stable. When increasing the subjects, the SVM only shows a slight performance drop. However, it suffers underfitting and produces the worst recognition accuracy limited by the poor representation ability. (4) Although there is a slightly better performance for arousal, the recognition performance for the two variables in four subject scales does not diverge considerably, which is aligned with the high annotation correlation of PMEmo dataset as we have described in Section 4.3. According to the analyses, the defect of the single EDA input motivates us to include additional information through multimodal fusion.",

This situation is common for user-independent emotion recognition: the same song listened by different people will stimulate the different emotional states, then get the opposite labels. The parameter optimization of deep learning model is strongly dependent on the loss between the predicted output and ground-truth label for backpropagation. When the same input data maps the total different ground-truth labels, the network optimization becomes very hard. If there exists many such data, the network training may even get corrupted. Therefore, for single music recognition, we directly used the result (SVM + Music) in our previous work  [62] . The results are presented in the 7th row of Table  3 . We can make some analyses: (1) compared with single EDA input, the performance with single music input get improved for valence recognition because the EDA is less relevant to the valance state  [53, 57]  but the music has a strong relationship with subject's valence/arousal moods  [41] . (2) For single music features, if considering subject specificity, the same music might lead to a completely opposite emotional state, which means the same music input maps to label 0 and 1 with different subject. (3) The single music input can reveal people's general emotion states at a certain extent. But it is not enough for user-independent emotion recognition. Although the SVM classifier with single music feature has achieved 70% accuracies, it has limited ability to recognize the cases which map to different emotion labels because of individual differences. Towards this, we add the music feature as the static emotion benchmark to help the convergence of our RTCAN-1D.",

For some experiments of fitting ability, since the network structure has been slightly changed for different datasets, we present the results in DEAP, AMIGOS and PMEmo datasets.   4 .\n\nIn practice, we find that the best performance is given by the simplest structure. By using a deeper convolutional layer and more internal channels, the performance of RTCAN-1D get drop-off, and the network can be easily overfitting, which is more obvious in smaller scale DEAP and AMIGOS datasets. In general, a deeper network leads to better representation performance at the expense of space and time cost. However, when the inner class features are not consistent, and the number of training data scale is not large enough, such as millions of images for image recognition  [24] , the complicated structure is harmful for EDA feature extraction. It is much clear in Table  4 . Therefore, we applied the simplest structure 𝑑 = 1 and 𝑐 = [64, 64, 64, 64] for our res-block. Experimental results with different attention modules in three datasets are shown in Table  5 . As introduced in Section 5.2.1, the increase of subjects involved may increase the fitting ability of the model. In order to explore the appropriate structure of our network, we should analyze the results in the large-scale PMEmo dataset and two smaller scale DEAP and AMIGOS datasets, respectively.\n\nIn the large-scale PMEmo dataset, 𝐵𝑎𝑠𝑒 only contains the ResNet backbone and multi-linear layers to classify the fused EDA+music feature vector, hence it gets the poor accuracy in both three datasets. The higher recognition accuracies from 𝑅 𝑎 and 𝑅 𝑏 prove the effectiveness of the individual attention subnet, compared with 𝐵𝑎𝑠𝑒 model. When combining all the two modules, we can observe that the joint use of channel and temporal relationships 𝑅 𝑐 produces further improvement. Reviewing the results in Table  5 , it should be emphasized that both SCA and RTNA are indispensable because all the sequential methods outperform the basic backbone when adding a Basic single attention submodule in the large-scale PMEmo dataset. In smaller scale DEAP and AMIGOS datasets, it can be seen that the simplest 𝐵𝑎𝑠𝑒 is not the worst model. When adding the SCA_Res modules, three configurations 𝑅 𝑏 , 𝑅 𝑐 , 𝑅 𝑓 get performance drop, the accuracies and F1-scores of which are even lower than 𝐵𝑎𝑠𝑒. The most complicated structure 𝑅 𝑓 produces the worst results. It means when we add SCA modules in each residual block, the fitting ability of RTCAG-1D gets increased and causes the overfitting drop-off. When we only add the SCA and RTNA to process the extracted shallow feature, the 𝑅 𝑒 model achieves the best results. Therefore, we remove the SCA modules of residual blocks to avoid over-fitting in small-scale datasets. The experiments in this subsection also reveal that when we design the DNN structure for user-independent emotion recognition, the scale of the subject involvement should be carefully considered.",

      "text": "Recently, researchers in neural network interpretation have proposed some methods for qualitative analysis. One of the most popular methods is visualizing the weight distribution in the regions of input to show which parts are more important for predictions. Gradientweighted Class Activation Mapping (Grad-CAM)  [51]  is an excellent visualization method that applies back gradient computing to reversely acquire the important weight of the input positions in convolutional layers. In the image domain, the output mask of Grad-CAM is overlaid on the semitransparent input image in the form of a heatmap with a warm-to-cool color spectrum. As warmer color is applied, the highlighted pixels contribute more to the final prediction, and the model will focus more on these messages. For another model, if the Grad-CAM mask covers more target regions in the same input, the network's receptive field of the is larger. And generally, it means the network has superior representation ability.\n\nTo show the ability of our attention submodules intuitively, we compare the visualization attention weights of the 3 trained model in the preceding experiment of Section 5.3.2: 𝑅 𝑎 (channel attention model), 𝑅 𝑏 (temporal attention model) and 𝑅 𝑐 (integrated channel-temporal attention model). In order to fit the proposed framework, we adapt Grad-CAM and start the guided backpropagation from the output layer of each attention submodule in order to invert 1D attention weights in the 3-channel EDA input. Fig.  5  and Fig.  7  show the sequences of pre-processed input signal and output attention weights from Grad-CAM. The input of valence and arousal situation (Subject-ID: 100184, Music-ID: 1) are randomly selected. In order to illustrate the corresponding relationship more clearly, the curves the 3-channel signal curves and the attention weights histogram are shown in one chart. Moreover, attention weights are presented in the form of spectrograms in Fig.  6  and Fig.  8 . We can see that the attention weights of the channel attention module consider the relationships between different channels. The weight of attention of the temporal attention module focuses more on the temporal distribution. The attention weights of the integrated channel-temporal attention model selectively cover the regions better than other models because the corresponding spectrogram contains the most warm color, and black columns in the chart are densest in important regions. It is also clear that the integrated RTCAN-1D pays more attention to the sharp peaks in 3 curves. The quantitative experiment results in Section 5.3.2 and qualitative visualization comparisons in this subsection can show that the channel and temporal attention modules guide the proposed RTCAN-1D to improve the performance of the network.",

      "text": "To validate our proposed network's superiority, we provide extensive comparisons in three emotion datasets. The single EDA signals from the small-scale DEAP and AMIGOS datasets are used to compare our RTCAG with SOTA EDA-based methods. And large-scale PMEmo with music and EDA signals is applied to prove the effectiveness of our multimodal fusion. Those SOTA models include both the hand-crafted feature-based conventional classifiers and deep learning-based frameworks.\n\nFor single EDA, previous works applied various models to classify the hand-craft features such as Support Vector Machine (SVM)  [12, 34] , Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP)  [52] . The CNN-based methods  [40, 50, 62]  with auto feature extraction were also proposed. We notice that the EDA decomposition is gradually being used for emotion recognition task  [52] . And our previous work  [62]  has also combined CvxEDA  [20]  and ResNet  [23]  for emotion recognition. Recently, Machot et al.\n\n[1] trained a 3-layer SOTA CNN using a grid search technique to get 82% accuracy on the subjectindependent model. It should be noted that there is not much EDA-based emotional recognition in previous works. For example, there is no baseline use of EDA signals for valence and arousal classification in DEAP dataset. Hence, for a comprehensive evaluation, the comparisons are not limited to the EDA-based model. Other multimodal psychological signal-based methods (EEG,ECG) make use of traditional classifiers (𝑒.𝑔., SVM  [34] ) and deep learning model (𝑒.𝑔., DCNN  [40] ). Table  6  lists the comparisons between our model and previous studies. Our RTCAG outperforms existing EDA-based SOTA methods. It should be noted that for binary recognition in DEAP, the evaluation results of our model in valence dimension are a little lower than 3 layers CNN model  [1]  because they directly mapped the scales (1 ∼ 9) into 2 levels. For example, the valence scale of 1 ∼ 5 was mapped to \"negative\" and 6 ∼ 9 to \"positive\", respectively. The arousal scale of 6 ∼ 9 was mapped to \"passive\" and 6 ∼ 9 to \"active\", respectively  [1] . The direct value annotation labeling of Machot et al.  [1]  simplified the recognition problem without considering the subject emotion threshold. Moreover, Alexnet-2D  [40]  has fused 7 physiological signals, i.e. EEG, EOG, EMG, GSR, TMP, BVP, RSP, it's natural that our RTCAG-1D only with EDA signals cannot outperform Alexnet-2D  [40]  but the competitive results can also prove the effectiveness of our model.\n\nFor multimodal solution, the better performance of mixed-method multiphysiological signals also indicates the multi-feature fusion as mixed inputs contain more affective messages than a single input if acquisition equipments are sufficient. However, considering the user-friendly applications for reliability and hard acquisition, our RTCAG does not involve more physiological signals but adds the music features. With the effective temporal and channel attention mechanism, the representation ability of our well-designed RTCAG has improved to mine more useful EDA features. Hence, the performance of RTCAN-1D gets a significant improvement than our previous Res-SIN  [62]  without changing music features. All the results in three datasets validate the superiority of our RTCAN-1D.",

The single input music or EDA signal cannot alleviate this problem. Towards this, we make an attempt with multimodal fusion. In this work we propose an end-to-end framework called the 1-dimensional residual temporal and channel attention network for user-independent emotional recognition. As the first attempt, our proposed RTCAN-1D separately uses the temporal-channel attention modules to mine the longrange temporal correlations and channel-wise relationships to reweight the distribution of the shallow features. Moreover, in large-scale PMEmo dataset, the fusion of emotion benchmarks from external music stimulation and the individual specificity from EDA also significantly improves the performance of our model. Extensive experiments in three popular datasets validate the effectiveness of our model. In future work, the fusion of external static features and traditional physiological signals will be an efficient way for large-scale affective computing. The attention mechanism can also further improve the ability of CNN's end-to-end frameworks. We believe the research of EDA-based emotion recognition will promote a lot of practical applications.",
