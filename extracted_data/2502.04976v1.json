However, existing ERG research is predominantly confined to the singleton text modality, limiting its effectiveness since human emotions are inherently conveyed through multiple modalities. To combat this, we introduce an avatar-based Multimodal ERG (MERG) task, entailing rich text, speech, and facial vision information. We first present a large-scale high-quality benchmark dataset, AvaMERG, which extends traditional text ERG by incorporating authentic human speech audio and dynamic talking-face avatar videos, encompassing a diverse range of avatar profiles and broadly covering various topics of real-world scenarios. Further, we deliberately tailor a system, named Empatheia, for MERG. Built upon a Multimodal Large Language Model (MLLM) with multimodal encoder, speech and avatar generators, Empatheia performs end-to-end MERG, with Chainof-Empathetic reasoning mechanism integrated for enhanced empathy understanding and reasoning.

      "text": "In recent years, the advent of Large Language Models (LLMs)  [8-10, 20, 45, 52]  has endowed machines with unprecedented levels of intelligence, bringing us closer to the realization of Artificial General Intelligence (AGI). However, the true essence of AGI extends beyond merely achieving human-level intelligent abilities; it must also encompass emotional understanding and empathetic capabilities comparable to those of humans. For instance, during human-machine interactions, it is crucial for machines to comprehend human emotions and intentions  [12, 17, 28, 29, 53] . This necessity has driven the development of Empathetic Response Generation (ERG)  [36] , a task aimed at enabling machines to produce emotionally nuanced and compassionate responses to user queries, thereby facilitating emotion-aware conversations. Over the past decade, ERG has garnered significant research attention  [31, 38, 49] . Due to its ability to support emotional interactions with humans, ERG has been applied in various practical scenarios, such as psychological therapy and elderly companionship dialogue systems.\n\nHowever, current ERG research might encounter significant challenges due to its confinement to a singleton textual modality as task definition. It is worthwhile to reflect on how humans naturally express emotions; in many cases, the subtleties of emotions are more effectively and comprehensively conveyed through nontextual modalities. Specifically, in dynamic visual contexts, subtle facial expressions and body movements can communicate richer emotions and intentions. Simultaneously, in the auditory domain, variations in speech intonation and pitch can also convey emotional states that text alone cannot express. Figure  1  demonstrates a multimodal empathetic dialogue process. Existing text-based ERG tasks are restricted to providing users with mere textual responses, which lack enough warmth and emotional resonance inherent in human interactions, thereby falling short of achieving adequate empathetic effects. Furthermore, from the user's perspective, there is a desire to express emotions directly through speech or talking-facial video rather than being confined to text-based queries. In practical applications, numerous ERG scenarios require the ability to accept multimodal signal inputs and generate empathetic responses in multimodalities, such as in psychological therapy, companion robots, and electronic personal assistants. Unfortunately, there has yet to be any research on avatar-based Multimodal Empathetic Response Generation (MERG) within the community.\n\nTo bridge this gap, in this paper we present an Avatar-based Multimodal Empathetic Response Generation benchmark dataset (namely, AvaMERG). Building upon existing text-based ERG benchmark  [36] , we further augment the dataset to include multimodal signals and annotations. Specifically, for each utterance in the dialogue, we provide 1) authentic human-reading speech and 2) dynamic talking-face avatar videos (2D facial modeling) that both correspond to the intended emotion. AvaMERG features a wide variety of avatar profiles and covers broad common topics of real-world scenarios, including multiple age groups, genders, vocal tones, intonations, and appearances, thereby effectively simulating a diverse range of multimodal empathetic dialogue scenarios in realistic environments. We maintain the high quality of annotations through meticulous manual verification, guaranteeing the emotional accuracy and consistency of both the avatars' speech and video. Finally, we compile 33,048 annotated dialogues with 152,021 multimodal utterances, establishing a foundation for MERG research.\n\nA direct approach to generating multimodal empathetic responses can be first producing the textual part of the response using existing text-based ERG models (e.g., high-performing LLMs), and then through a pipeline paradigm to invoke external well-trained speech generator and talking-head generator (e.g., diffusion-based models) to generate the corresponding multimodal content. However, there can be several non-trivial issues and inherent challenges. First, ensuring the emotional accuracy across the text, audio, and video is the most fundamental capability. Second, it is essential to maintain synchronization and consistency among the three modalities in terms of content, emotion, and style. Pipeline models often suffer from inadequate interaction between different modules, making it difficult to guarantee consistency. For example, the generated speech may convey the emotion of a happy girl, while the corresponding avatar depicts a crying boy. Third, the discrete approach (where LLMs invoke external audio and video generators) can largely lead to the quality decrease of the generated content due to error propagation.\n\nTo achieve high-quality MERG, we thus propose a novel Multimodal LLM, termed Empatheia. Architecturally, we employ a multimodal encoder to feed all input signals into the central LLM for comprehension and reasoning. We then utilize StyleTTS2  [22]  as the speech generation module and DreamTalk  [30]  as the Talking Face Generation module. By using continuous embeddings as the medium for message passing, we connect the LLM to the frontend encoders and backend cross-modal generation modules, resulting in a full end-to-end system. Next, we optimize Empatheia by implementing a series of tuning strategies. We first devise a Chain-of-Empathetic Inference to assist the LLM to reason step-bystep, from understanding the emotion to identifying the underlying rationale and intent, and ultimately determining how to respond to the user's input. Then, we introduce Content Consistency Learning, which encourages the LLM to guide the two backend modules to produce speech and talking-face avatar videos that align with the empathetic textual content. Further, we propose a Style-aware Alignment and Consistency Learning mechanism to accurately identify the style signals transmitted by the central LLM, and ensure consistency in the style of both speech and video avatars, including emotion and profile. Finally, we perform overall MERG tuning to achieve overall high-quality multimodal empathetic responses.\n\nWe conduct experiments on the AvaMERG dataset, where the results demonstrate that our Empatheia system generates both textual and multimodal empathetic responses of higher quality compared to baseline models. In-depth analyses further reveal the underlying rationales for our model's advancements. Overall, this work pioneers the research of MERG, contributing a benchmark dataset and a strong-performing end-to-end MERG model, laying a solid foundation for future exploration in multimodal empathetic response generation.",

      "text": "ERG  [33, 34]  is one of the crucial tasks within the field of affective computing, which aims at enabling dialogue models to produce responses imbued with empathy during human-machine conversations. Due to its significant practical applications, ERG has attracted substantial and sustained prior research attention  [11, 24, 54] . Existing studies have developed various methods to enhance the performance of ERG systems  [2, 13, 38, 50] .\n\nYet current ERG approaches can be limited to a single text modality, which significantly restricts their effectiveness. In real-world dialogue scenarios, multiple modalities are often involved. As previously emphasized, multimodal information is crucial for generating more empathetic responses. Therefore, this paper tries to pioneer the research of Multimodal Empathetic Response Generation (MERG) by presenting a novel benchmark. It is also noteworthy that several recent related works have also touched upon multimodal ERG  [48, 51] .\n\nHowever, we emphasize that these studies do not fully address or cover all the modalities most relevant to empathy. Intuitively, both audio (capturing variations in a person's tone) and visual (capturing facial expressions) modalities can be important, and need to be simultaneously addressed. Moreover, it is insufficient to rely solely on emoticon-type visual features. Effective ERG that closely aligns with real-world application scenarios should present authentic facial visual signals.\n\nUnlike existing text-based ERG models and methods, achieving multimodal emotional understanding and generating multimodal signals requires the utilization of multimodal-related technologies. First, our approach is related to research on Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs), with our system being based on a backbone MLLM. Various MLLMs, such as LLaVA  [25] , MiniGPT-4  [55] , have been investigated and widely validated for their strong semantic understanding capabilities. However, most MLLMs are limited to multimodal information comprehension yet do not support the flexible generation of diverse modal content beyond text  [1, 19, 39] , such as audio and visual outputs. Although there are a few MLLMs that support the generation of various modal signals, such as NExT-GPT  [46]  and Unified-IO 2  [27] , these models, unfortunately, are only capable of understanding and generating signals in general scenarios. They lack sufficient capabilities in emotion detection and emotional content generation. In other words, these MLLMs are unable to generate emotionally expressive speech or talkingface avatars. Therefore, we consider developing a novel MLLM for MERG, which is able to accurately generate emotionally charged speech and talking-face avatar videos. Additionally, we design a series of emotion-enhancement training strategies to ensure that our MLLM possesses highly-performing MERG capabilities.",

First, we consider enriching the data with the identity information for both participants in the dialogue, including ages, genders, and also tone, such that MERG models can learn the correct avatar profile for both audio and video.\n\nAs the OpenAI GPT-4 1  has been validated for its remarkable performance in context understanding and thus extensively employed for data generation  [28, 46] , here we also adopt GPT-4 for our annotation. We define four age periods (child, young, middle-aged, elderly), binary genders (male, female), and three vocal tones (emphatic, mild, gentle). We ask GPT-4 to determine the above labels for each utterance in ED. Since the data in the raw ED is ill-balanced, e.g., most of the dialogues occurred between young or middle-aged participants, we further employ GPT-4 to produce more dialogue of ERG with above meta-information. Also, GPT-4 will detect the dialogue topics. Human annotators with 3-person cross-checking are recruited here to carefully check if the dialogue content, the meta-profile, and the topics are correct and of high quality. This led to the textual part of our AvaMERG data.\n\nNext, we create the multimodal part of the information. First, we recruit a big number of English-speaking volunteers of the above different ages, genders, and vocal characteristics, and also different races (i.e., Asian, Caucasian, African, Latino, Indian). Then, we assign and group different pairs of two participants according to the profile determined in the AvaMERG dialogue. Next, we let these annotators carefully read the utterance text, with the correct emotional performance, including the tone, pitch, timbre and microfacial expressions, where we then record their vocal speeches and talking-head videos. After the recordings, we recruit another group of well-trained annotators to evaluate each dialogue for content accuracy and emotional accuracy with same 3-person cross-checking. We ask each annotator to check: 1) whether the speech and video content match the content in textual utterance; 2) whether the speech and video style (including age, gender, tone, emotion) are consistent. Only the instance will be accepted where all three annotators vote for approval. This results in the final AvaMERG dataset.",

Following the signal features (𝑟 𝑡 𝑖 , 𝑟 𝑠 𝑖 , 𝑟 𝑣 𝑖 ) from LLM, the backbone speech generator and talkinghead generator will produce the non-textual contents, respectively. To ensure high-quality multimodal generation, we employ the current state-of-the-art StyleTTS2  [22]  and DreamTalk  [30] , respectively. Note that these generators are well-trained before integrating into our system. However, directly generating speeches and dynamic avatars would largely lead to the issues of inconsistency of both content and style. That is, two aspects of consistency are required: 1) Consistency of content, both the speech should be synchronized with the talking-head video, both of which should be further aligned with the textual response; 2) Stylistic Coherence, the style within text/speech/vision, including both the emotion and profile (age, gender, tone, appearance), should be kept consistent. For natural and accurate MERG, maintaining synchronized content and style across modalities is crucial.\n\nFor these purposes, we further design two modules before the two generators: content synchronizer and style disentangler.\n\nContent Synchronizer. The content synchronizer (CS) aims to ensure that the speech and vision generators receive the correct response content information. As shown in Figure  4 (a), the module is essentially a Transformer-based  [42]  variational auto-encoder (VAE)  [16] . mainly consists of two transformer blocks, which CS encodes the 𝑟 𝑡 into latent representation 𝑧 𝑐 , from which the decoder reconstructs the content of speech 𝐶 𝑠 and vision 𝐶 𝑣 .\n\nwhere 𝑞 𝑠 𝑐 and 𝑞 𝑣 𝑐 represent learnable content query features for two modalities, which are fed into the decoder along with the output from the encoder. 𝐶 𝑠 guides the speech generator to produce speech that correctly delivers the response text, while 𝐶 𝑣 guides the talkinghead generator to generate accurate mouth movements reflecting the response text.\n\nStyle Disentangler. Style features (including emotions and profiles) can be subtly different in speech module and vision module. The style disentangler (SD) module thus aims to disentangle the style features from the LLM-output 𝑟 𝑠 𝑖 and 𝑟 𝑣 𝑖 , for two modules, respectively. As shown in Figure  4 (b), similar to CS module, SD also uses VAE blocks to disentangle the emotion and profile representations for speech and video:\n\n𝑃 𝑠/𝑣 = Dec SD (FFN(𝑧\n\nwhere 𝐸 𝑠/𝑣 are the disentangled emotion features. 𝑃 𝑠/𝑣 are the corresponding profile features. 𝑞 𝑠/𝑣 𝑒 and 𝑞 𝑠/𝑣 𝑝 denote the learnable query features. Then, we fuse the 𝐸 𝑠/𝑣 and 𝑃 𝑠/𝑣 by a speech/video style layer, and obtain the final speech/video style feature:\n\nwhich will be passed to two generators separately. To further regulate the successful extraction of emotional and profile-aware features, we also fuse the emotion feature 𝐸 𝑠 and 𝐸 𝑣 into 𝐸, and the profile feature 𝑃 𝑠 and 𝑃 𝑣 into 𝑃. Then we use an emotion classifier and a set of profile classifiers to predict the labels of emotion, avatar's age, gender, and tone.",

Has SD module successfully disentangled emotion and profile features? While previous ablation experiments have validated the efficacy of the SD module, it remains uncertain whether it has fully achieved the intended goal of separating emotion and profile features. To explore this, we present the t-SNE  [41]  visualization on the fused multimodal emotion representations in Figure  7 , where we select 500 samples with varying emotions from AvaMERG.\n\nAs shown, the results indicate that SD module significantly increases the separation between different emotion categories while clustering the representations of the same emotion. Similarly, the patterns on profile features confirm that SD has successfully disentangled the non-emotion avatar features.",

      "text": "Finally, we present two case studies to further demonstrate the specific multimodal empathetic generation capabilities of Empatheia, as illustrated in Figure  8 , where we compare the outputs of the Pipeline baseline (without CoE). In the first instance, the user's text does not exhibit an explicit emotional inclination. However, the accompanying sad speech and facial expressions suggest that the user may feel sentimental about \"meeting a friend from middle school\". The Pipeline model, lacking the integration of the CoE strategy, generates an unempathetic response. Also, due to the absence of a style synchronization mechanism, there are inconsistencies in the emotions conveyed between the video and audio components. In contrast, our Empatheia system not only produces high-quality empathetic response content but also ensures that the speech and talking avatar exhibit correct and consistent emotional expressions. Similarly, in the second example, the Pipeline system erroneously interprets the user's emotion, mistakenly assuming that the user is happy about securing second place, whereas Empatheia accurately identifies the user's true emotional state through comprehensive multimodal understanding. Furthermore, the Pipeline incorrectly assigns the avatar's identity, presenting a male voice paired with a female avatar. On the contrary, our Empatheia shows outstanding capability in correctly handling the avatar profile consistency challenge. In Appendix §F.4 we showcase more instances for more sufficient case studies.",

AvaMERG encompasses a diverse range of avatar profiles and covers various real-world scenarios, providing a robust foundation for multimodal empathetic dialogue research. Further, we present Empatheia, a benchmark system tailored for MERG.\n\nBased on a backbone LLM as the core reasoner, Empatheia leverages a multimodal encoder, speech generator, and talking-face avatar generator, forming an end-to-end system. We further enhance Empatheia with a Chain-of-Empathetic reasoning mechanism, and implement a series of empathetic-enhanced tuning strategies, including content consistency learning and style-aware alignment and consistency learning, to ensure emotional accuracy and content/profile consistency across modalities. Experimental results demonstrate that Empatheia consistently outperforms baseline methods in both textual ERG and MERG tasks, highlighting the efficacy of our approach.",

Empatheia relies on multimodal inputs, including text, voice, and video, which contain highly sensitive personal data. It is essential to ensure that all data collected and processed by the system adheres to strict privacy and data protection regulations, such as the GDPR or CCPA. The system must implement strong encryption techniques for storage and transmission, while also ensuring user data is anonymized where possible. Users should have full control over their data, including the ability to delete their inputs and outputs from the system. Regular audits of data handling and retention practices should be conducted to maintain compliance with privacy standards. Emotional Manipulation and User Vulnerability. Since Empatheia is designed to interact empathetically with users, it may encounter individuals in emotionally vulnerable states. The system must avoid exploiting this vulnerability or manipulating emotions in harmful ways. Safeguards should be in place to ensure that the chatbot's responses are supportive but do not give inappropriate advice or encourage dependency. Ethical guidelines should be established to prevent the misuse of the chatbot, and users should be made aware that it is a machine-generated response system and not a substitute for professional psychological help. Where appropriate, the system could be designed to refer users to human professionals in cases of serious emotional distress.",

Bad actors might leverage the system's empathetic capabilities for malicious purposes, such as manipulating others through emotion-driven content or creating deepfakes for deceptive purposes. To mitigate this, the development of Empatheia should include security measures to prevent exploitation, such as limiting the use of avatars and ensuring that any generated content is watermarked or traceable. The open-source release should come with strict usage guidelines and community oversight to ensure responsible use of the system.\n\nLong-Term Psychological Effects. The long-term effects of interacting with an empathetic AI system like Empatheia on human users should be carefully considered. While the system aims to foster deeper emotional connections, there is a risk that users may become overly reliant on AI for emotional support, potentially leading to social isolation or reduced human empathy. Further research should be conducted to assess the psychological impact of prolonged use of such systems, and regular evaluations should be made to ensure that the system enhances human emotional well-being rather than detracting from it.",

From our practice, several promising directions for future research can be identified.\n\nExploring Higher Performance of MLLMs and Efficient Training Methods. Future work can investigate the performance of various MLLMs in the generation of empathetic responses, particularly their advantages and limitations when processing multimodal inputs. Currently, we utilize state-of-the-art speech and avatar generators; however, their performance remains limited. Therefore, it is essential to enhance the quality of multimodal generation. Also, more efficient training methods, such as transfer learning, few-shot learning, or self-supervised learning, can be explored to improve the training efficiency and performance of these models. Through systematic experimental comparisons, the aim is to identify best practices that enhance the quality and responsiveness of empathetic response generation.\n\nDeveloping Multidimensional Evaluation Methods. Currently, the evaluation of the multimodal generation component of MERG relies solely on human evaluations, which introduces significant uncertainty. Future research should aim to establish multidimensional evaluation methods to comprehensively and automatically assess the effectiveness and quality of multimodal empathetic responses. This can be achieved by combining automated evaluations with human assessments. Specifically, deep learning-based evaluation models can be developed to automatically analyze the semantic consistency of generated responses, the accuracy of emotional conveyance, and the synergistic effects of multimodal inputs. Additionally, emotional analysis tools and semantic understanding techniques should be utilized to conduct detailed emotional depth analyses of the generated responses. Furthermore, the research should explore how to assess cross-modal correlations, such as evaluating the consistency between text, audio, and video, to further enhance the comprehensiveness and accuracy of the evaluation.\n\nEnhancing the Model's Contextual Understanding. Future research can focus on improving the model's understanding of conversational context, particularly in retaining and utilizing historical information during long dialogues. Consideration could be given to incorporating more complex memory mechanisms or contextual attention mechanisms to enhance the model's contextual awareness.\n\nExploring Cross-cultural Expressions of Empathy. Future work can investigate how to effectively generate empathetic responses across different cultural contexts. The research could focus on analyzing the impact of cultural differences on emotional expression and communication styles, adjusting the model based on these findings to better accommodate users from diverse cultural backgrounds.\n\nImproving Dataset Diversity and Quality. Future work can focus on collecting and constructing larger-scale, more diverse multimodal datasets to encompass a wider range of emotional expressions and conversational scenarios. By enhancing the representativeness of the dataset, the model's generalization ability and robustness in diverse emotional interaction contexts can be further improved.",

      "text": "As an expert in empathetic dialogue analysis, your task is to analyze the emotional dynamics and intentions behind a conversation between two participants: a 'speaker' and a 'listener'. The goal is to first consider the event scenario in which the conversation takes place, and then identify the 'Emotion Cause' for the speaker and the 'Goal to Response' for the listener's final reply. Task Overview: 1. Emotion Scenario: Identify the specific event that occurs within the context of the conversation, which serves as the backdrop for the emotional dynamics and interactions between the speaker and listener. 2. Emotion Cause: Based on the conversation context, sentiment, and dialogue history, analyze and identify the underlying emotional cause or trigger for the speaker. 3. Goal to Response: Analyze the last response from the listener and identify the intended goal behind that response.\n\nThe goal should relate to how the listener is attempting to address the speaker's emotional state. Input JSON Field Descriptions: -dia_id: A unique identifier for the dialogue.\n\nsentiment: The emotional tone of the conversation.\n\ncontext: The background information of the conversation, describing the environment, setting, or situation in which the dialogue occurs.\n\ndialogue: The actual conversation or exchange of dialogue between speaker and listener. Expected Output: Please provide the following in **concise** JSON format: -**Event Scenario**: A **short description** summarizing the main context or situation of the dialogue (e.g.,  ' The speaker is expressing fear after experiencing something unsettling').\n\n-**Emotion Cause**: A **brief** explanation of the **specific event** or experience that triggers the speaker's emotion (e.g., 'Elevator game brings horror experience').\n\n-**Goal to Response**: A **concise** goal that describes the **specific emotional state** the listener is attempting to address (e.g., 'Alleviating fear'). Example Output: { \"dia_id\": \"<dia_id>\", \"event_scenario\": \"The speaker is expressing fear after experiencing something unsettling\", \"emotion_cause\": \"Elevator game brings horror experience\", \"goal_to_response\": \"Alleviating fear\" } To ensure the accuracy of the emotion annotations, we implement a validation step where human annotators review the GPT-4 assigned emotions. This process involves cross-referencing the emotion labels with the dialogue content to verify consistency and appropriateness. Any discrepancies are resolved through discussion among annotators, ensuring high-quality emotion annotations.\n\nEnriching Identity Information. To enable MERG models to generate appropriate avatar profiles for both audio and video modalities, we further annotate each utterance with identity information for both participants in the dialogue. This includes:\n\n• Age: We define four age periods-child (0-15 years), young (16-34 years), middle-aged (35-59 years), and elderly (60+ years). • Gender: Binary genders-male and female.\n\n• Timbre: Three vocal timbres-low, mid, and high.\n\nGPT-4 is utilized to determine the above labels for each utterance, ensuring that the dialogue reflects realistic interactions between participants with diverse profiles. The identity annotations are critical for training models to generate contextually appropriate and personalized empathetic responses in multiple modalities.\n\nData Balancing and Expansion. Observing that the raw ED dataset is imbalanced (e.g., most dialogues involve young or middleaged participants), we employ GPT-4 to generate additional dialogues that include underrepresented age groups and genders, as well as a balanced distribution of timbres. GPT-4 also detects and labels the dialogue topics, covering 10 primary common topics: [Social Issues and Moral Dilemmas, Achievements and Self-Realization, Support and Comfort, Emotions and Feelings, Disappointments and Expectations, Life Events, Interpersonal Relationships, Health and Well-being, Uncertainty About the Future, Personal Struggles and Challenges].\n\nTo enhance diversity, GPT-4 is instructed to generate dialogues that based on various races, cultural backgrounds, and socio-economic statuses, reflecting a realistic and inclusive range of human experiences.

AvaMERG boasts a diverse array of avatar profiles. This diversity ensures that models trained on AvaMERG can generalize across various demographic profiles, promoting inclusivity and reducing biases. AvaMERG contains a total of 33,048 dialogue samples and 152,021 dialogue utterances, distribution across both age groups and gender, as illustrated in the figure  2 . The dataset includes avatars representing different life stages: Child, Young, Middle-aged, and Elderly, with a nearly equal gender representation within each category. This ensures that the models trained on AvaMERG can generalize effectively to a wide variety of demographic profiles, promoting inclusivity and reducing bias in real-world dialogue systems. For children, there is an almost equal split between male (12,563) and female  (12, 577)  utterances. Among the young adult group, the dataset includes 37,010 male utterances and 37,488 female utterances. In the middleaged category, there are 15,208 male utterances and 13,818 female utterances. Lastly, the elderly group shows an equal number of utterances for both genders, with 11,763 male and 11,763 female utterances. This diverse age and gender representation ensures that dialogue systems trained on AvaMERG can perform robustly across various demographic profiles, enhancing fairness and inclusivity in real-world applications.\n\nDetailed and rich emotional design for real-world applicability. We adopt 32 fine-grained textual emotions and 7 coarsegrained multimodal emotions, and map them appropriately, as shown in Figure  10 . As shown in the emotional distribution in Figure  2 , AvaMERG covers a wide range of emotional expressions. Among the 33,048 dialogues, the most prevalent emotion is sadness, accounting for 56.7% of the samples, which reflects the empathetic nature of many conversations, especially in scenarios requiring emotional support or assistance. This is followed by happiness (20.3%), which captures the dialogues involving positive reinforcement or joyful interactions. Other emotions such as anger (7.9%), contempt (7.9%), and surprise (6.3%) are also represented in reasonable proportions, ensuring that the dataset includes not only empathetic responses but also situations where the user expresses negative or unexpected emotions. Fear and disgust appear less frequently, with 5.1% and 1.8% respectively, but still provide valuable instances for training models that can handle a full spectrum of emotional states. This rich emotional diversity ensures that models trained on AvaMERG are capable of understanding and generating appropriate responses to a broad range of emotional expressions, improving the model's ability to handle real-world interactions where emotions play a critical role.\n\nA comprehensive topic design. The AvaMERG dataset showcases a meticulously designed mapping between various real-world topics and the emotional responses they elicit, providing an invaluable resource for training empathetic response models. As shown in the heatmap Figure  11 , topics such as \"Achievements and Self-Realization\", \"Disappointments and Expectations\", \"Health and Well-being\", and \"Personal Struggles and Challenges\" elicit a wide range of emotional responses, including anger, happiness, and sadness. For instance, \"Health and Well-being\" is associated with a significant number of utterances reflecting fear (1,158), sadness (2,214), and disgust (810), which mirrors real-world conversations where health concerns often evoke complex emotions. Similarly, \"Achievements and Self-Realization\" is more frequently linked to positive emotions, with 3,214 utterances expressing happiness, demonstrating the natural alignment between positive life events an gry  and joyful emotions. In contrast, \"Social Issues and Moral Dilemmas\" and \"Uncertainty About the Future\" are characterized by more negative emotions, such as fear and contempt, reflecting the inherent challenges and anxieties that arise when discussing social complexities or future uncertainties. By covering a wide spectrum of topics and emotions, the dataset enables the development of empathetic models capable of understanding and responding to the nuanced emotional underpinnings of different conversations.",

      "text": ". Empatheia comprises four complementary training stages, each playing a crucial role in the overall process. In the following sections, we will provide a more detailed overview of the specific training details for each stage. ▽Training Objective: In this phase, we aim for the LLM to learn how to engage in step-by-step reasoning based on CoE to generate high-quality empathetic responses, effectively completing the ERG task. This stage lays the groundwork for subsequent content consistency learning.\n\n▽Training Method: During this phase, we employ LoRA and Negative Log-Likelihood (NLL) loss to fine-tune Vicuna, training it to engage in empathetic reasoning by calculating the loss associated with the target component. The training data for this phase not only includes the dialogue context from the first phase but also incorporates the pre-extracted audio and video content representations corresponding to each response text. Specifically, for speech, we input the response text into the two text encoders, 𝐸 𝑎𝑐𝑜 and BERT, in StyleTTS2. The resulting embeddings, ℎ 𝑡𝑒𝑥𝑡 and ℎ 𝑏𝑒𝑟𝑡 , are concatenated to produce the gold content representation for speech. For video, we utilize the audio encoder 𝐸 𝑎𝑢𝑑 in DreamTalk to obtain the gold content representation for video.\n\n▽Training Objective: The training objective for this phase is to align the speech and video representations output by the content synthesizer with the gold content representation. This alignment enables the CS to learn to produce outputs that are both accurate and exhibit consistent content signal features.\n\n▽Training Method: In this phase, we freeze the parameters of the LLM and only fine-tune the parameters of the CS module. We calculate the L2 loss between the predicted content representation and the ground truth content representation. ▶Training step3: Style Aligning and Consistency Learning ▽ Training Data: The input data format for this phase is illustrated in D.1, which uses multimodal special token placeholders in a dialogue format. The target training data consists of the audio and video style representations. The gold audio style representation is pre-extracted through the 𝐸 𝑟𝑒 𝑓 encoder of StyleTTS2, which processes the gold speech, while the gold video style representation is pre-extracted using DreamTalk's 𝐸 𝑠𝑡 𝑦 encoder, which processes the gold video. To ensure style consistency, in this stage, we also apply supervised constraints to the SD module using emotion and profile labels.\n\n▽Training Objective:The goal of this phase is to align the speech and video style representations output by the SD module with the gold style representations, allowing the SD module to learn to produce accurate and consistent style signals.\n\n▽Training Method: During training, we use ImageBind and a mapping layer to extract audio and video features from the multimodal dialogue, which are then used to replace the special token placeholders. As in the previous phase, we freeze the parameters of the LLM and train the SD module using L2 loss and classification loss. ▽Training Objective: This stage constitutes a comprehensive finetuning process aimed at equipping the model with the full capability of multimodal empathetic responses. It aims to provide not only sufficiently empathetic textual responses but also synchronized, content-and style-accurate multimodal responses.\n\n▽Training Method: In this stage, we employ LoRA for fine-tuning the LLM while simultaneously updating the CS and SD modules. The overall loss is calculated as the weighted sum of the losses from the previous three stages.",

Also, the pipeline system will not be equipped with the CoE strategy. For the training of our pipeline, we exclusively utilize text data and additionally introduced profile attributes.

      "text": "For the text ERG task, we employ three evaluation metrics: Emotion Accuracy (Acc), and Distinct metrics (Dist-1 and Dist-2). These metrics are designed to evaluate both the emotional correctness of the generated responses and their lexical diversity.\n\nEmotion Accuracy (Acc). Acc measures the percentage of correctly predicted emotions in the generated responses. The correct emotion is defined as the exact match with the ground truth emotion label. Acc is computed as follows:\n\nwhere 'correct emotions' represents the total number of responses where the predicted emotion matches the gold label.\n\nDistinct-1 (Dis-1). This evaluates the diversity of unigrams (single words) in the generated responses. It is defined as the ratio of unique unigrams to the total number of unigrams in the generated text:\n\nA higher Distinct-1 score indicates more lexical diversity and reduces the likelihood of repetitive responses.\n\nDistinct-2 (Dis-2). This is analogous to Distinct-1, but it measures the diversity of bigrams (two consecutive words). It is computed as follows:\n\nA higher Distinct-2 score indicates that the model is generating more contextually diverse phrases.\n\nHuman Evaluation of Textual ERG. For human evaluation, we randomly selected 200 dialogues from the test dataset. Taking into account both the cost of human labor and the reliability of the results, we chose competitive models from the last year as representative baselines. Given the dialogue context and the responses generated by these models, we engaged three annotators to score the responses using a majority voting system. They rated each response on a scale from 1 to 5 (1: not at all, 3: adequate, 5: excellent) based on four key criteria: Empathy, Coherence, Informativity, and Fluency. Specifically, these criteria are: 1) Empathy (Emp): whether the response demonstrates an understanding of the user's emotions and experiences, and responds appropriately. 2) Coherence (Coh): whether the response is logically consistent and contextually relevant.\n\n3) Informativity (Inf): whether the response provides useful and meaningful information. 4) Fluency (Flu): whether the response is grammatically wellformed and easy to read.",

CPBD quantifies the perceptual sharpness of the generated video frames by estimating the probability that an observer would detect blurring based on edge width analysis. Higher CPBD values indicate sharper images and fewer perceived blurs. The CPBD score is calculated by first analyzing the cumulative distribution of edge widths in an image. For each edge in the image, the probability that the edge is perceived as blurred is computed. The overall CPBD score is the average of these probabilities over all edges. The formula can be expressed as:\n\nwhere 𝑃 (𝑒 𝑖 ) is the probability of blur detection for edge 𝑒 𝑖 , and 𝑁 is the total number of detected edges in the image. This metric gives a perceptual estimate of how likely it is for human viewers to notice blur across the video frames.\n\nStructural Similarity Index Measure (SSIM). SSIM assesses the visual similarity between the generated avatar video frames and the ground truth video frames. It measures the perceived quality in terms of luminance, contrast, and structure:\n\nwhere 𝜇 𝑥 and 𝜇 𝑦 are the means of the generated and reference images, 𝜎 2 𝑥 and 𝜎 2 𝑦 are the variances, and 𝜎 𝑥 𝑦 is the covariance of the two images. 𝐶 1 and 𝐶 2 are constants to stabilize the division.\n\nSyncNet Confidence Score (Sync 𝑐 𝑓 ).

The \"Avg. Score\" reflects the average performance across six carefully crafted manual evaluation metrics, which together capture various aspects of the model's ability to generate multimodal empathetic responses. The results show that the transformer block reaches its peak performance at the 4 layers. Deeper layers can, to some extent, enhance the model's learning ability by capturing more complex interactions between patterns. However, further increasing the number of transformer layers did not lead to significant improvement. Therefore, Empatheia sets the number layers of transformer blocks to 4. Figure  13  illustrates the impact of different numbers of audiovisual special tokens on model performance. As shown, the model's performance peaks when the number of tokens reaches 16.\n\nWe scale the content and style learning losses using 𝛼 and 𝛽 to bring them closer to the magnitude of the Vicuna's inherent loss, aiming to achieve balanced training. The experiments on loss hyperparameters are visualized in a heatmap in Figure  14 , the model performs better when 𝛼 and 𝛽 are relatively balanced, indicating that a more balanced loss contributes to the model's convergence to an optimal solution.   module for multimodal generation, the average score growth rate of the Pipeline in terms of accuracy and consistency in multimodal generation lags significantly behind Empatheia.

This indicates that each individual step in CoE plays a vital role, enhancing the model's ability to comprehensively analyze and understand user's emotion and intention.
