      "text": "Imaging of facial affects may be used to measure psychophysiological attributes of children through their adulthood for applications in education, healthcare, and entertainment, among others. Deep convolutional neural networks show promising results in classifying facial expressions of adults. However, classifier models trained with adult benchmark data are unsuitable for learning child expressions due to discrepancies in psychophysical development. Similarly, models trained with child data perf orm poorly in adult expression classification. We propose domain adaptation to concurrently align distributions of adult and child expressions in a shared latent space for robust classification of either domain. Furthermore, age variations in facial images are studied in age-invariant face recognition yet remain unleveraged in adult-child expression classification. We take inspiration from multiple fields and propose deep adaptive FACial Expressions fusing BEtaMix SElected Landmark Features (FACE-BE-SELF) for adult-child expression classification. For the first time in the literature, a mixture of Beta distributions is used to decompose and select facial features based on correlations with expression, domain, and identity factors. We evaluate FACE-BE-SELF using 5fold cross validation for two pairs of adult-child data sets. Our proposed FACE-BE-SELF approach outperforms transfer learning and other baseline domain adaptation methods in aligning latent representations of adult and child expressions.",

      "text": "ROM infancy to adulthood, facial expressions are a ubiquitous, information-rich component of human social interactions. Facial expressions may provide valuable information about a child's development into an adult  [1] ,  [2] ,  [3] . Many applications of automatic facial expression analysis (FEA), including education (e.g., engagement in the classroom  [4] ,  [5] ,  [6] ), healthcare (e.g., monitoring of pain  [7] ,  [8] , mental health  [9] ,  [10] , autism  [11] ,  [12] ,  [13] ), and entertainment (e.g., video games  [14] ,  [15] ) remain relevant from childhood into adulthood. To better support such applications, FEA models need to generalize across distinctive expression patterns from early childhood to adulthood. Developing models robust to age variations is a challenging problem in FEA  [16] ,  [17] . Most existing approaches optimize the FEA performance on data sets representing specific age ranges. There has been limited work on classifying facial expressions across age groups.\n\nFurthermore, age variations in facial images have been well-studied in facial age estimation and age-invariant face recognition (AIFR), but there has been little cross-pollination among these relevant research areas to improve FEA considering adult-child age variations. In the following sections, we discuss related work on the classification of adult and child expressions and methods from relevant research fields. Then, we propose a novel deep feature adaptation approach to the classification of adult and child expressions inspired by the state-of-the-art domain adaptation learning, facial age estimation, and AIFR literature.",

      "text": "Existing off-the-shelf FEA tools and research  [18] ,  [19] ,  [20]  have been mostly developed using adult benchmark data sets  [17] ,  [21] ,  [22] . However, facial morphology and kinematics gradually develop throughout childhood  [23] ,  [24] , resulting in a distribution shift between child and adult expression patterns. For models trained on adult data sets, the distribution shift toward adults poorly generalizes distinctive patterns in child expressions  [25] ,  [26] ,  [27] ,  [28] . While benchmark data sets of child facial expressions remain limited, they are growing in number  [29] ,  [30] ,  [31] . Therefore, there has been an emerging trend directed at the classification of child facial expressions  [25] ,  [26] ,  [27] ,  [28] . Recently, deep transfer learning using convolutional neural networks (CNNs) has shown promise for child facial expression classification  [26] ,  [27] ,  [32] . However, recent studies focus only on maximizing performance on child facial expression benchmarks, bounded by limited age range and sample size  [17] . Such models tuned for child expressions fail to generalize to adult expressions  [28] . To overcome the poor generalization problem across age groups, limited existing work on facial expression classification involving mixed age groups (child, adult, elderly) suggests two primary approaches: (1) curating a mixed age training set to match the age distribution of the test set  [33] , and  (2)  classifying images into age groups to determine the ageappropriate model for subsequent classification  [34] . The first approach requires the age distribution of the test set to be known a priori with availability of benchmark data matching. The second approach requires a robust age group classifier to select an appropriate expression classifier model and benchmark data to train expression classifiers for individual age groups. Age group classification is a challenging problem  [35] ,  [36]  and variations in expression make accurate age estimation even more challenging  [34] ,  [37] . Furthermore, developments in both facial structure and muscle movements contribute to visual differences in child and adult expressions. A child's growth is a gradual and uniquely individual process, making the transition unclear when a child manifests the full spectrum of adult expressions.\n\nRecently, domain adaptation has shown an interesting pathway to adapt an adult expression classification model using few child expression samples  [27] . This approach utilizes a dual stream deep CNN architecture and semantically aligns the class conditional distributions of child and adult domains  [27] . The underlying framework of this approach  [38]  is based on learning a domain-invariant latent representation. Such domain-invariant representations have shown to generalize even to unseen domains  [38] . We hypothesize that learning a domain-invariant representation of expressions may prove effective for facial expression classification across child and adult domains.",

      "text": "While limited attention has been given to facial expression classification across age groups, facial age estimation  [39]  and AIFR  [40]  are active research areas. State-of-art approaches for facial age estimation and AIFR benefit from deep learning and fusion of geometric and texture features  [36] ,  [39] ,  [41] . Geometric features derived from facial landmarks capture structural changes associated with childhood development while texture features capture skin artifacts, such as wrinkles, associated with adult aging  [36] ,  [41] . Contemporary studies continue to use traditional feature extraction methods, e.g., local binary patterns, histograms of oriented gradients, etc., but recently emphasize deep learning, e.g., CNNs, for texture feature extraction  [39] ,  [40] ,  [42] . Common geometric landmark features include distances between landmarks, ratios of distances, and areas and angles of triangles formed by landmark triplets  [35] ,  [43] ,  [44] ,  [45] . Similar landmark features, including pairwise distances between landmarks and areas/angles of facial polygons formed by connecting neighboring landmark points, have also shown to be discriminative for FEA  [46] ,  [47] ,  [48] ,  [49] . Therefore, we hypothesize that domain-invariant representation learning of adult and child facial expressions can benefit from a fusion of CNNextracted and landmark-derived features.\n\nThe use of the same feature types in both facial age estimation and AIFR suggests a subset of features correlated with and invariant to age. Statistical latent variable models optimized using the Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithm have been applied to AIFR to decompose feature sets into age and identity factors  [40] . This approach identifies a set of discriminative features for identity recognition using the identity factor, representing facial identity features invariant to age  [40] . Gong et al.  [50]  have first proposed this approach using hidden factor analysis (HFA). HFA assumes the independence of age and identity, which is untrue in practice as different individuals may have different aging patterns  [40] . To overcome the independence assumption, the modified HFA (MHFA) approach introduces an additional factor representing age and identity-correlated facial appearance variations  [51] . Given that the appearance of facial expressions varies among individuals and age groups, we hypothesize that FEA can benefit from decomposition of feature sets into those correlated with expression, domain (adult or child), and identity. However, MHFA assumes that data are independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.) following a normal distribution with homogenous variances, which may not be true for real world facial expression data. Furthermore, HFA and MHFA require the optimization of one model per feature, making high dimensional feature vectors computationally prohibitive  [50] ,  [51] . Thus, principal component analysis (PCA) has been used for dimensionality reduction prior to HFA or MHFA  [50] ,  [51] . While PCA guarantees that the first principal components explain more of the variance than subsequent principal components, such linear data projection method does not guarantee that the PCA feature space will be discriminative for classification. Each principal component is a linear combination of all input features, making it less intuitive to understand the contribution of individual features. Moreover, all features, even those with limited contribution to discriminability, are needed to reproduce the same principal components.\n\nVery recently, the Beta-Mixture (BetaMix) method  [52]  has been proposed to determine significant correlations among large numbers of variables using a mixture of Beta distributions. The method, based on ideas and results from convex geometry, works well even for moderate sample sizes, e.g., 𝑁 = 10 depending on the number of predictors, and does not require assumptions of i.i.d., normality, or homogeneity of variances. The BetaMix method detects correlations among all the features at once, so the EM algorithm needs to be applied only once for all features rather than for individual features. Since the BetaMix method is appropriate for large feature vectors, dimensionality reduction is not required and the feature correlations may be interpreted directly, allowing for greater understanding of the interaction between the features and domain, identity, and expression factors. The BetaMix method has shown promising results across multiple applications, including feature selection and classification  [52] .",

      "text": "We fit the BetaMix method  [52]  to find significant correlations between the extracted features from adult-child data and three experimental factors taken from the labeled data: expression, domain, and identity. Based on given data, the BetaMix method automatically learns a threshold that represents significant correlations among pairwise features and factors. The extracted features for the source and target data sets are concatenated to form a matrix of 𝑃 predictors and 𝑁 samples, where 𝑃 > 𝑁. Expression, domain, and identity are also entered into the model, yielding a (𝑃 + 3) × 𝑁 matrix. We assume the data as 𝑃 + 3 points in ℝ 𝑁 . Subspaces of ℝ 𝑁 lie on the Grassmann manifold, a special type of Riemannian manifold with a nonlinear structure  [52] . The Grassmann manifold 𝔾 𝑁,𝑑 is used to study 𝑑-dimensional subspaces of ℝ 𝑁  [52] . Principal angles ( 𝜃 1 , … , 𝜃 𝑑 ) between 𝑑 and 𝑙-dimensional subspaces in 𝔾 𝑁,𝑑 have an invariant measure for 𝑑 ≤ 𝑙 that can be used to compute the volume and probability of their sets  [52] . These principal angles can be used to determine canonical correlations (𝜌 1 , … , 𝜌 𝑑 ) as 𝜌 𝑘 = cos 𝜃 𝑘 with pairs of canonical variables {𝜑 𝑘 , 𝜙 𝑘 } 𝑘=1 𝑑 where 𝜑 𝑘 ∈ 𝔾 𝑁,𝑑 , 𝜙 𝑘 ∈ 𝔾 𝑁,𝑙  [52] . When 𝑑 = 𝑙 = 1, 𝔾 𝑁,1 corresponds to lines through the origin of Euclidean space  [52] . The line is a natural choice of projection due to its computational ease and interpretability. Furthermore, when 𝑑 = 𝑙 = 1, the random variable sin 2 𝜃 has the following Beta distribution  [52] :\n\nThus, we consider that the predictors and factors lie on 𝔾 𝑁,1 and define 𝜃 𝑘 as the angle between the 𝑘th pair of predictors/factors, 𝑘 = 1, … . , ((𝑃 + 3)(𝑃 + 2)) 2\n\n⁄  [52] . We let 𝜆 𝑘 = sin 2 𝜃 𝑘 . A predictor or factor is considered 'null' if it corresponds to a randomly sampled point in ℝ 𝑁 . As shown in  [52] , pairs of null predictors/factors are expected to be mutually perpendicular with high probability, even for moderate values of 𝑁. In relation to Equation (1), a mixture of Beta distributions may be used to determine if the pair represented by each 𝜆 𝑘 are 'null' (uncorrelated) or 'nonnull' (correlated). Then, the BetaMix model is defined as:\n\nwhere 𝑑 0 (𝜆 𝑘 ) is the null distribution, 𝑑(𝜆 𝑘 ) is the alternative distribution, 𝜄 0 𝑘 ~𝐵𝑒𝑟(𝑝 0 ) is a random indicator that equals one if the 𝑘th pair of predictors corresponding to 𝜆 𝑘 are 'null', and 𝑝 0 is the probability of the 'null' component. The 'null' component of the mixture model is defined by the Beta distribution:\n\n)\n\nwhere 𝑠 ≤ 𝑁 is the estimated effective sample size. The 'nonnull' component of the mixture model is defined as:\n\nwhere 𝛼, 𝛽 > 0. The latent mixture variables (𝛼, 𝛽, 𝑠) are estimated using the EM algorithm. The E-step updates 𝜄 0 𝑘 with the posterior mean:\n\nand 𝑝 0 is updated with its maximum likelihood estimate, 𝑝0 = 𝔼(𝜄). The M-step obtains the maximum likelihood estimates of 𝛼, 𝛽, and 𝑠 by solving the following equations:\n\nwhere 𝜓(•) is the digamma function. The E-and M-steps are repeated iteratively to update the parameters until convergence. Pairs of predictors/factors are considered 'nonnull' if the posterior null probability under 𝑑 0 is smaller than threshold 𝜏, 𝜄0 𝑘 < 𝜏. We denote the maximum 𝜆 𝑘 that satisfies 𝜄0 𝑘 < 𝜏 as 𝑄. Then, the screening rule for nonnull pairs may be written as 𝜆 𝑘 < 𝑄. Since 𝜆 𝑘 = sin 2 𝜃 𝑘 and 𝜌 𝑘 = cos 𝜃 𝑘 , pairs with a correlation of at least 𝜌 = cos (sin -1 (𝑄 1/2 )) are considered significant. Fig.  2  summarizes the BetaMix method.\n\nBased on the fitted Beta distribution, a graphical model is built where each node is a predictor or factor. An edge connects each nonnull predictor-predictor pair or factorpredictor pair. These edges represent a significant correlation between the connected nodes (predictors or factors). A subgraph formed by a factor and its adjacent predictor nodes captures the subset of predictors that are significantly correlated with the factor. Using these subgraphs, we decompose the feature vector into sets correlated with expression, domain, and identity. For our proposed FACE-BE-SELF approach, we select the features in the expression subgraph and prune features that also appear in the domain or identity subgraphs. The resulting selection of features is used in subsequent feature fusion.",

      "text": "We perform preprocessing of the CAFE, ChildEFES, CK+, and Aff-Wild2 data sets following Section 2.2. To evaluate our proposed FACE-BE-SELF method, we consider data sets in two source/target pairs: CK+/CAFE (posed expressions only) and Aff-Wild2/ChildEFES (majority spontaneous expressions). We split each data set into multiple train, validation, and test sets using a 5x2 nested cross validation design. In the outer 5-fold cross validation loop, the data is split into train (4 folds) and test (1 fold) sets. In the inner loop, the train set is divided into 2 to yield inner train and validation sets for hyperparameter selection. The validation performance metrics are averaged across the two folds to yield the best hyperparameters. These hyperparameter selections are then used to train the model with the recombined outer loop train set and evaluate on the held-out test fold. This procedure is repeated a total of 5 times, such that each sample appears in one of the 5 test sets. To avoid inflation of performance estimates based on subject-specific features, we generate the cross validation folds such that each subject appears in one fold only and no subject appears in both train and test sets  [26] ,  [27] .\n\nWe fit the BetaMix method on the train sets for each source/target pair. The fitted mixture model identifies nonnull (significantly correlated) pairs of predictors/factors which are used to build a graph with predictors/factors represented as nodes and significant correlations represented as edges. By examining the subgraphs of each factor node and its adjacent predictor nodes, we report the mean number of significantly correlated features for each factor and the overlap of features appearing in multiple factor subgraphs. To select features for subsequent fusion, we consider the expression subgraph, pruning features that also appear in the domain and/or subject subgraphs. We assess the discriminability of our data-driven feature selection compared to that of features selected based upon a range of correlation thresholds (0.1, 0.2, …, 1.0).\n\nThe average overall F1 performance on the inner 2-fold cross validation loop is used to select a value for the loss balancing parameter 𝜉 (Equation (  13 )) for each of the outer 5-fold cross validation train sets. Other studies  [68] ,  [69]  have found that 𝜉 is problem-specific and consider values in the range (0.00, 1.00). Due to high computational costs, we choose among representative low (0.01), moderate (0.3), and high (0.8) values in (0.00, 1.00). To better understand the contributions of CNN, BetaMix-selected landmark features, and domain adaptation to our proposed FACE-BE-SELF approach, we perform an ablation study.\n\nThen, we evaluate the performance of our proposed domain adaptation with FACE-BE-SELF approach on two source/target data set pairs and compare against four baseline models: 1) CNN trained on source data (source CNN)  [26] , 2) CNN trained on target data (target CNN)  [26] , 3) three transfer learning approaches (pretraining on source data then, a, training on target data  [26] , b, fine-tuning on the target data  [26] , or c, fine-tuning on a mixture of source and target data), and 4) two existing domain adaptation approaches  [27] ,  [38] .\n\nFor all experiments, we train deep models using the ADAM optimizer with a triangular learning rate policy  [70]  cycling between a minimum learning rate of 𝜁 𝑚𝑖𝑛 = 10 -5 and a maximum learning rate of 𝜁 𝑚𝑎𝑥 = 10 -3 .

Our experiments on four data sets and comparison of eight facial expression classification methods have revealed four important findings as follows. First, the decomposition of landmark features for  While the CNN feature space is known to exhibit adultchild domain shift  [25] ,  [26] ,  [27] ,  [28] , our results suggest the domain shift to be dependent on the domain data set pair. The underlying data dependency (differences in overlap regions of Fig.  6  (a) and Fig.  6 (b) ) may be attributed to differences in sample size and demographics, age ranges, and/or mixture of posed/spontaneous expressions  [16] ,  [17] . Second, a parsimonious feature selection is obtained from the expression subgraph after eliminating features significantly correlated with the other factors (Fig.  7 ). Third, our ablation study shows that fusing these selected landmark features and CNN-extracted image features improves the expression classification performance for both child and adult data (Table  1 ). Fourth, our proposed FACE-BE-SELF method outperforms all baseline models for the posed data sets (CK+/CAFE) and performs competitively for the data sets with spontaneous expressions (Aff-Wild2/ChildEFES). The sections to follow provide detailed discussions in addition to and expanding upon these four key findings.",

      "text": "Our comparison of the proposed data-driven feature selection and a range of correlation thresholds reveals that our data driven BetaMix approach yields the largest correlation threshold prior to substantial performance degradation (Fig.  7 ). This threshold corresponds to a parsimonious selection of highly correlated features that preserve useful complementary information for expressions that is discarded at higher thresholds. Furthermore, fusing CNN-extracted features with the selected landmark features improves the classification performance of child and adult facial expressions (Table  1 ). Like age estimation and AIFR, facial expression classification also benefits from the fusion of geometric landmark and texture features  [39] ,  [40] . Given that the feature fusion model outperforms CNN features only, our selected landmark features provide complementary information representative of expressions beyond that learned by the CNN (Table  1 ). The effectiveness of selected features in classification suggests that the proposed BetaMix correlation coefficient threshold is an effective metric in optimizing feature selection for facial expression classification.",

      "section_name": "Domain Adaptation For Expression Learning",
      "text": "Our findings suggest that domain adaptation methods provide robust representation learning of adult and child facial expressions (Fig.  8 ). During adaptation, source and target performance are jointly optimized via ℒ 𝐶𝑠 and ℒ 𝐶𝑡 while the class conditional distributions are aligned using ℒ 𝐷𝐴 . This optimization procedure ensures balanced performance on both domains. Our findings also confirm that supervision on both domains (as in transfer learning) or a method of domain alignment is required for effective classification (Fig.  8 ). For both CK+/CAFE and Aff-Wild2/ChildEFES source-target pairs, we observe poor cross domain performance for CNNs trained on a single domain (Fig.  8 ). This poor cross domain performance is indicative of distribution shift and replicates the findings of multiple prior studies  [26] ,  [27] ,  [28] .\n\nOur proposed FACE-BE-SELF method yields higher source and target average overall F1 scores for CK+/CAFE than all baseline models, with similar average overall F1 scores for source and target of 0.8443 and 0.8303, respectively, with a difference of 0.0140 (Fig.  8 ). Spontaneous expression classification (Aff-Wild2/ChildEFES) is more challenging than classification of posed facial expressions such as CK+ and CAFE. For example, Aff-Wild2 is the most challenging of the four data sets that we use to evaluate our approach. Current state-of-the-art performance on the official test set for Aff-Wild2 is an overall F1 score of 0.3587, achieved by the best performing team at the recent 3rd Affective Behavior Analysis in-the-wild Competition  [71] . Please note that our results are not directly comparable as  we perform cross validation rather than use the official test set. For Aff-Wild2/ChildEFES, the best performing models are FACE-BE-SELF and fine-tuning on a mixture of source and target data (Fig.  8 ). Compared to fine-tuning on a mixture of source and target data, FACE-BE-SELF performs better on ChildEFES (average overall F1 score 0.4557 > 0.4214) and worse on Aff-Wild2 (average overall F1 score 0.5201 < 0.6032) but has a smaller difference in source and target performance (0.0644 vs 0.1897). Thus, despite poorer performance on Aff-Wild2, FACE-BE-SELF offers better target (ChildEFES) performance and more balanced performance between source and target.\n\nThe ROC curves for CK+/CAFE (Fig.  9  (a)(b)) reveal that despite class imbalance during training, FACE-BE-SELF learns to recognize all classes with AUCs near unity, indicating high sensitivity and specificity. For ChildEFES, the ROC curves show that all classes perform better than chance (Fig.  9 (d) ). 'Surprise', with its distinctive open mouth appearance achieves an AUC of unity while negative expressions 'anger' and 'sad' prove more difficult. The ROC curves for Aff-Wild2 (Fig.  9 (c) ) reflect the challenging nature of the data set with an overall average AUC of 0.52, close to chance level (0.50). The best performing classes are 'anger' (AUC 0.65) and 'fear' (AUC 0.65), while 'disgust' performs worst (0.15).",

To quantify the contributions of both BetaMixselected landmark features and CNN features in the feature fusion model, we use the expected gradients method  [73]  as implemented in the SHAP library (https:// github.com/slundberg/shap) to obtain and visualize the (approximate) SHAP values for both landmark and CNN features. Fig.  10  visualizes the SHAP values for source (CK+) and target (CAFE) domains. We use the same image from the CK+ data set for all visualizations. Fig.  10 (a)  shows the SHAP values associated with source and target image inputs to the CNN feature extractor. For both source and target, areas of the input with the greatest (positive or negative) contribution to expression classification are those involved in producing facial expressions: the eyebrows, eyes, nose, and mouth. The symmetric features (the second area at the left corner of the lips and area between the right eye and eyebrow) are also among the top ten most important features, but in different orders of importance. In addition to these six triangle area features, three inter-landmark distance features are ranked among the top ten for both domains. These features represent distances between the mouth and eyes (2 features) and the mouth and nose (1 feature). As with the image input, the top ten landmark features represent important areas of the face for producing expressions: the eyebrows, eyes, and mouth.",

Even with a small effective sample size, BetaMix is shown to capture significantly correlated landmark features. However, there may be features that are useful for classification of expressions but are not significantly correlated with expression based on the BetaMix-learned minimum correlation coefficient. Furthermore, the data dependency of BetaMix feature selections may affect performance on unseen data sets. An additional adaptation or fine-tuning step may be required for these models to address possible data dependency. The age ranges studied cover 2 to 8 years for CAFE, 4 to 6 years for ChildEFES, and 18+ years for CK+. Aff-Wild2 does not report specific age ranges. Further research is required to determine if the adapted models are capable of generalizing to participants in other age groups, e.g., teens and pre-teens.",

The explainability and visualization of SHAP values corroborate the facial expression classification performance of our method. The superiority of our method over existing transfer learning and domain adaption methods satisfies the need for a systematic feature selection, feature fusion, and domain adaptation to perform domain-invariant classification. In future work, we plan to investigate the generalizability of this approach to other age groups and data acquisition pipelines. We hope that this approach may be used to yield automated, objective assessments of age or domain varying patterns in other applications.",
