      "text": "Speech Emotion Recognition (SER) task has known significant improvements over the last years with the advent of Deep Neural Networks (DNNs). However, even the most successful methods are still rather failing when adaptation to specific speakers and scenarios is needed, inevitably leading to poorer performances when compared to humans. In this paper, we present novel work based on the idea of teaching the emotion recognition network about speaker identity. Our system is a combination of two ACRNN classifiers respectively dedicated to speaker and emotion recognition. The first informs the latter through a Self Speaker Attention (SSA) mechanism that is shown to considerably help to focus on emotional information of the speech signal. Experiments on social attitudes database Att-HACK and IEMOCAP corpus demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method and achieve the state-of-the-art performance in terms of unweighted average recall.",

      "text": "Speech is one of the most important medium for human communication, not only conveying linguistic information but also rich and subtle para-linguistic information. In particular the affective prosody of speech conveys the emotions which play an important role in the perception of an utterance meaning. Therefore, speech emotion recognition (SER), which aims to recognize the actual emotional state of a speaker from the utterance he produced, has raised a great interest among researchers.\n\nAs pointed out by Scherer in  [1] , there is an undeniable contradiction between the apparent ease with which listeners judge emotions from speech and the intricacy of finding discriminative features in speech signal for emotion recognition. This contradiction, in part, lies in the role that individual difference variables play in the production of emotional speech  [2] . In particular, the acoustic characteristics of the speaker voice as well as its speaking style, for a significant part, determine its way of expressing the emotions.",

      "text": "Formerly adressed using statistical methods and traditional learning techniques such as Hidden Markov Models (HMMs), Gaussian Mixture Models (GMMs) and Support Vector Machines (SVMs), the SER task has known significant improvements over the past years with the advent of deep neural networks (DNNs). Indeed such deep networks have shown excellent abilities to model more complex patterns within speech utterances by extracting high-level features from speech signal for better recognition of the emotional state of the speakers.\n\nMao et al.  [3]  firstly introduced Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) for the SER task and obtained remarkable results on various datasets by learning affective-salient features. Recurrent neural networks (RNNs) has also been introduced for SER purpose with a deep Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory (BLTSM) network proposed by Lee et al.  [4] . Several papers have then presented CNNs in combination with LSTM cells to improve speech emotion recognition, based on log Mel filterbanks (logMel)  [5]  or raw signal in an end-to-end manner  [6] .\n\nRecently, attention mechanisms have raised great interest in the SER research area for their ability to focus on specific parts of an utterance that characterize emotions. Mirasmadi et al.  [7]  approached the problem with a reccurent neural network and a local attention model used to learn weighted time-pooling strategies. Neumann et al.  [8]  used an attentive CNN (ACNN) and showed the importance of the model architecture choice against the features choice. Ramet et al.  [9]  presented a review of attention models on top of BLSTMs and proposed a new attention computed from the outputs of an added BLSTM layer. Chen et al.  [10]  proposed a 3-D Attention-based Convolutional Recurrent Neural Networks (ACRNN) for SER with 3-D log-Mel spectrograms (static, deltas and delta-deltas) as input features. They showed 3-D convolution can better capture more effective information for SER compared with 2-D convolution. Recently, Meng et al. outperformed this method by using dilated convolutions in place of a pooling layer and skip connection.\n\nAttempts to inform emotion classification networks with extra-information involved in the description of emotions were proposed in the past years. Based on previous works  [11, 12, 13] , Li et al.  [14]  proposed a multitask learning framework that involves gender classification as an auxiliary task to provide emotion-relevant information leading to significant improvements in SER. Analogously, speaker identity has been used to inform emotion classification networks. The problem was approached by Sidorov et al.  [15]  with speaker dependent models for emotion recognition. Recently, a method for speaker aware SER was introduced by Assunc ¸ão et al.  [16] , a CNN model VGGVox  [17]  is trained for speaker identification but is instead used as a front-end for extracting robust features from emotional speech. These first attempts have shown that teaching SER systems with additional signal-based information can greatly improve performances.",

      "text": "In this paper, we assume that individuals may use different means to express emotions, and then that SER should be conditionned on the speaker identity information. Following this hypothesis, we propose a novel method based on previous work  [10] . The major contributions of this paper are summarized as:\n\n1. Conditioning emotion classification to speaker identity by using a key-query-value attention we called Self Speaker Attention (SSA) that allows to compute both self and cross-attribute (relation between speaker identity and emotions) attention scores to focus on emotion relevant parts of an utterance.\n\n2. Proposing a novel regularization by constraining the weights of the last fully connected layer of the network so as to avoid class collapse.\n\n3.

A max-pooling is performed after the first convolutional with pooling size is 2 × 2. The 3D features are reshaped to 2D, keeping time dimension unchanged and passed to a linear layer for dimension reduction before reaching the recurrent layer. As precised in  [10] , a linear layer of 768 output units is shown to be appropriate. These features are then processed through a bi-directional recurrent neural network with long short term memory cells (BLSTM)  [19] , with 128 cells in each direction, for temporal summarization, which allows to get 256-dimensional high-level feature representations.",

Our proposed systems are derived from this baseline SER system Cem.\n\n• ACRNN-r : Addition of a regularization (described in 2.4) to Cem model to avoid class collapse.\n\n• SSA-CRNN-r : A first ACRNN model Csp (embedding size 64) is trained for speaker recognition to learn highlevel features that define the speaker identity, and from which our SSA mechanism will extract emotion salient information to inform the SER task. Once best accuracy is reached, the model is saved and fixed. Then a second ACRNN model Cem (embedding size 128) is trained conditionally to the BLSTM's outputs of Csp by mean of the SSA mechanism for SER task.\n\nFor evaluations, 10-fold cross validation technique is performed. Respectively for IEMOCAP and Att-HACK, 9 and 18 speakers are considered for training while the remaining ones are kept for validation. In the case of Att-HACK validation sets are balanced in gender (male-female couples) apart from 2 folds, as the database includes 12 females and only 8 males. As we aspire to perform emotion recognition independently of the speaker, we must consider two approaches for training the SSA-CRNN-r Csp module.\n\n1. speaker-dependant approach : a train/valid split have been performed linguistically on the whole database, all speakers have been seen by Csp. Consequently, the SER task is not performed independently of the speaker and there is no insurance the model will be able to generalize to speakers it has never seen.\n\n2. speaker-independant approach : a LOSO (Leave-One-Speaker-Out) protocol is followed so as to ensure that the speaker (or speakers for Att-HACK) on which the model is validated has never been seen by the model. For each fold k ∈  [1, 10]  the speaker s v k (or speakers\n\n) chosen to be in the validation set are left out of the database for the training and validation of Csp .\n\nEach module is optimized with respect to the cross-entropy objective function. Trainings are done with emotionally balanced mini-batches of 40 samples, using the Adam optimizer with Nestorov momentum. The initial learning rate is set to 0.0001 and the momentum is set to 0.9. The final model parameters are selected by maximizing the Unweighted Average Recall (UAR) on the validation set.",

First, we compare our ACRNN re-implementation with the state-of-the-art method described in  [10] .

[    1 : SER results with 95% confidence interval for different methods on Att-HACK and IEMOCAP in terms of UAR Next, we investigate the effectiveness of our proposed regularization. Compared with ACRNN, ACRNN-r obtains an absolute improvement of 38.47% on Att-HACK and 19.97% for IEMOCAP. This shows our regularization brings stability during training that allows the model to further recognize more subtle emotions. The confusion matrices depicted in Figure  3  also show the model is no longer over-focusing on one class, all the other classes are confused, with which was the case for dominant attitude in Att-HACK with the ACRNN.\n\nTo evaluate the addition of our proposed SSA mechanism, it is legitimate to chose the approach with LOSO protocol described in 3.2. Compared with ACRNN-r, this approach achieves an absolute improvement of 21.95 % for Att-HACK and 9.55 % for IEMOCAP. This shows combining emotion classification and speaker recognition through our SSA mechanism is relevant and lead to better capture speaker means of emotional expression. This approach achieves a global absolute improvement of 60.82 % for Att-HACK and 29.52 % for IEMOCAP compared with ACRNN. Compared with the gender-informed SER system by Zhang et al.  [13] , it achieves 13.10 % of UAR improvement on IEMOCAP. As expected, the speakerdependant approach achieves slightly better performance than the LOSO-based one although it does not seem significant. It appears that Csp is able to generalize enough for new speakers so as the SSA can capture the speaker high-level features that are relevant in the representation of speech emotions.  Finally, the t-SNE analysis in Figure  4  tend to show both attitudes and emotions are well separated in their respective embeddings. Although this point would need to be deeper investigated, we can further expect to use these embeddings in a voice conversion context as proposed by Zhou et al. in  [22] .",
