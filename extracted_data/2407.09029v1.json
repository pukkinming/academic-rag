      "text": "Multimodal emotion recognition systems rely heavily on the full availability of modalities, suffering significant performance declines when modal data is incomplete. To tackle this issue, we present the Cross-Modal Alignment, Reconstruction, and Refinement (CM-ARR) framework, an innovative approach that sequentially engages in cross-modal alignment, reconstruction, and refinement phases to handle missing modalities and enhance emotion recognition. This framework utilizes unsupervised distribution-based contrastive learning to align heterogeneous modal distributions, reducing discrepancies and modeling semantic uncertainty effectively. The reconstruction phase applies normalizing flow models to transform these aligned distributions and recover missing modalities. The refinement phase employs supervised point-based contrastive learning to disrupt semantic correlations and accentuate emotional traits, thereby enriching the affective content of the reconstructed representations. Extensive experiments on the IEMO-CAP and MSP-IMPROV datasets confirm the superior performance of CM-ARR under conditions of both missing and complete modalities. Notably, averaged across six scenarios of missing modalities, CM-ARR achieves absolute improvements of 2.11% in WAR and 2.12% in UAR on the IEMOCAP dataset, and 1.71% and 1.96% in WAR and UAR, respectively, on the MSP-IMPROV dataset.",

      "text": "Multimodal emotion recognition (MMER) entails the analysis of emotional cues across various modalities, including speech, text, and body language, among others. These modalities serve complementary functions in the expression and interpretation of human emotions. However, in practical applications, the availability of these modalities is * Yong Qin is the corresponding author. frequently compromised; specific modalities may be absent or inaccessible due to various factors. For example, text data may be unavailable due to errors in automatic speech recognition systems, speech may be obscured by excessive background noise, and visual data may be impaired by poor lighting or occlusions. These challenges underscore the need for MMER systems to be highly adaptable and robust, capable of effectively functioning even with incomplete modal information.\n\nConventional multimodal learning paradigms, as documented in the literature  (Yoon et al., 2018; Liu et al., 2022; Sun et al., 2024) , typically operate under the assumption of complete modality presence. These approaches are dedicated to constructing fusion models optimized for scenarios where all modalities are fully available, a presumption that can undermine their utility in situations where modalities are partially missing. Illustratively, as depicted in Fig.  1 , an emotion classified as \"angry\" in a fully modal context-primarily due to pronounced tones in the speech modality-may be reinterpreted as \"neutral\" in the absence of the speech component, with the text and video modalities becoming the guide.\n\nThe research community has developed innovative methodologies aimed at enhancing the resilience of MMER systems faced with incomplete modalities, primarily focusing on predicting miss-ing data across modalities. However, the significant distribution gaps between different modalities present substantial challenges. For instance,  Wang et al. (2023)  utilize flow models to map heterogeneous modality representations into a latent space following a Gaussian distribution, aiming to ensure consistency. Nevertheless, this approach does not adequately address the distribution gaps between modalities. Alternatively,  Zuo et al. (2023)  suggest the use of modality-invariant features to aid in reconstructing modality-specific characteristics. While this method is promising, it has been critiqued for its limited effectiveness, particularly due to difficulties in accurately predicting modalityspecific features. These strategies underscore the critical need for effective cross-modal alignment before attempting to predict missing data across modalities.\n\nTo address the aforementioned problems, this paper introduces a novel framework for cross-modal alignment, reconstruction, and refinement, designated as CM-ARR. The initial alignment phase aims to bridge the distributional divergences between modalities, which facilitates subsequent reconstruction efforts. Specifically, inspired by MAP  (Ji et al., 2023) , we employ an unsupervised 1  distribution-based contrastive learning approach that replaces point representations with their Gaussian distributional counterparts. This method can convey richer multimodal semantic information by effectively encoding uncertainty. Next in the reconstruction phase, we deploy a network based on normalizing flow models. This method transforms aligned modality representations into a Gaussian latent space  (Wang et al., 2023) . Gaussian distributions for missing modalities are estimated by transferring characteristics from available modalities. Subsequently, the representation of the missing modality is obtained through inverse normalization of the estimated Gaussian distribution. In the final refinement phase, we refine modality representations to better capture emotional characteristics. The initial phases prioritize semantic alignment, sidelining emotional attributes. Consequently, we implement supervised point-based contrastive learning. This method considers modalities from different instances of the same class as positive samples and thus disrupts the semantic correlation between modalities. Doing so enables the model to capture emotional attributes and related features beyond mere semantics, enhancing the reconstruction of emotional information.\n\nOverall, CM-ARR begins by aligning modalities to harmonize disparate modal distributions, a step that facilitates the effective estimation of missing data in the subsequent reconstruction phase, and concludes with refinement to accentuate emotional traits. The key contributions of this paper are summarized as follows:\n\n• We introduce the CM-ARR framework, a pioneering approach for cross-modal alignment, reconstruction, and refinement, designed to enhance emotion recognition in scenarios characterized by incomplete data.\n\n• We present two contrastive learning strategies: unsupervised distribution-based contrastive learning for effective uncertainty modeling and mitigation of distributional disparities, alongside supervised point-based contrastive learning that disrupts strong semantic intermodality correlations, facilitating a deeper understanding of emotional consistency.\n\n• Our empirical investigations, conducted on the IEMOCAP and MSP-IMPROV datasets under both missing and full modality conditions, affirm the superior performance of our proposed CM-ARR framework.\n\n2 Related Work",

      "text": "In MMER, there have been remarkable advances in research addressing the modality absence problem. These methods fall into two main categories: missing modality generation  (Cai et al., 2018; Suo et al., 2019; Du et al., 2018)  and multimodal joint representation learning methods  (Pham et al., 2019; Han et al., 2019; Yuan et al., 2021) .\n\nMissing Modality Generation aims to utilize available modalities to predict or reconstruct missing ones.  Tran et al. (2017)  introduce a Cascaded Residual Autoencoder (CRA) to fill in data with missing modalities. This method effectively recovers incomplete data by integrating a series of autoencoders in a cascaded structure and leveraging a residual mechanism to address corrupted data. Similarly,  Cai et al. (2018)  develop a 3D encoderdecoder network that captures the intermodal relationships and compensates for missing modalities through adversarial and classification losses.\n\nMultimodal Joint Representation Learning seeks to learn latent representations in a common feature space from available data that remain robust even when some modalities are missing.  Pham et al. (2019)  introduce a method for learning robust joint representations through cyclic translation between modalities, thereby enhancing the model's capability to comprehend and represent multimodal data.  Zhao et al. (2021)  propose the Missing Modality Imagination Network (MMIN), a unified model designed to address the issue of uncertain missing modalities.  Zeng et al. (2022b)  employ a Tag-Assisted Transformer Encoder (TATE) network, which guides the network to focus on different missing cases by encoding specific tags for the missing modalities. Furthermore, they  (Zeng et al., 2022a)  propose an Ensemble-based Missing Modality Reconstruction (EMMR) framework to detect and recover semantic features of the key missing modality. However, these methods do not consider the effect of heterogeneous modal gaps on missing modality reconstruction and emotion recognition. IF-MMIN  (Zuo et al., 2023)  and DiCMoR  (Wang et al., 2023)  work on this problem. The former learns modality-invariant features, and the latter transfers distributions from available modalities to missing modalities to maintain distribution consistency in the recovered data. Nevertheless, these approaches only partially bridge modal gaps and overlook semantic uncertainties across modalities. To overcome these limitations, we introduce the CM-ARR framework, which leverages Gaussian distributions to both align modalities and model semantic uncertainty.",

Across all evaluation metrics, CM-ARR consistently outperforms the competing models, indicating its superior performance.\n\nFurther analysis of CM-ARR's recognition performance on the IEMOCAP dataset under various missing modality conditions reveals notable findings. Specifically, when compared to the best SOTA model, DiCMoR + , CM-ARR achieves a relative enhancement of 3.07% and 3.06% in WAR and UAR, respectively, on average. Notably, CM-ARR demonstrates exceptional performance when at least one modality is present, particularly with the availability of the speech modality, showing a significant relative improvements of 4.41% and 4.26% across WAR and UAR, respectively. Con- versely, the performance gains are more modest when only the text modality is present. This discrepancy underscores the speech modality's capacity to encapsulate substantial textual information, facilitating the effective reconstruction of textual modality representations from speech. In contrast, the text modality's limited encapsulation of speechrelated information results in less effective speech modality reconstruction. In addition, the performance of our method is also optimized compared to SOTA under full modality testing condition. In conclusion, CM-ARR's ability to leverage available modalities for reconstructing missing modalities significantly mitigates the challenges posed by missing modalities, affirming its effectiveness in addressing the missing modality problem in multimodal emotion recognition.\n\nThe right side of Table  2  shows the performance comparison between CM-ARR and SOTA methods on the MSP-IMPROV corpus. Given the corpus's complexity as a challenging sentiment analysis dataset, the performance of these methods is generally modest.

To illustrate the limitations of models trained exclusively on full modalities in addressing missing modality scenarios, we establish a full modality baseline model, denoted as 'Baseline', which includes feature extraction and cross-modal fusion components. Results from the IEMOCAP dataset indicate a significant performance decline in the Baseline model when faced with missing modalities, underscoring its vulnerability to conditions of modality absence, given its training on the presumption of modality completeness.\n\nEffects of Unsupervised Distribution-based Contrastive Learning: To verify the effectiveness of the alignment phase, we perform an ablation experiment (w/o L udcl ) to evaluate the performance, as shown in Table  3 . The results show that the models with unsupervised distributionbased contrastive learning achieve better performance. This suggests that distribution-based representations could learn richer semantic information from modal uncertainty and help bridge the distributional divergences between modalities, which facilitates subsequent reconstruction. Additionally, replacing distribution-based contrast learning with point-based representation (w/ Point) further demonstrates that leveraging modal uncertainty to gather diverse semantic information offers added advantages. Consequently, Gaussian distributionbased representations prove superior to instancebased representations.\n\nEffects of Supervised Point-based Contrastive Learning: To validate the effectiveness of the refinement phase, we present the results of an ablation experiment (w/o L spcl ). The results show that it is helpful to improve the performance by disrupting the semantic correlation between modalities through our point-based supervised contrast learning.
