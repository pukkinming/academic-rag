This study addresses the issue of class imbalance, using the 'Liking' label in the DEAP dataset as an example. Such imbalances are often overlooked by prior research, which typically focuses on the more balanced arousal and valence labels and predominantly uses accuracy metrics to measure model performance. To tackle this issue, we adopt numerical optimization techniques aimed at maximizing the area under the curve (AUC), thus enhancing the detection of underrepresented classes. Our approach, which begins with a linear classifier, is compared against traditional linear classifiers, including logistic regression and support vector machines (SVM). Our method significantly outperforms these models, increasing recall from 41.6% to 79.7% and improving the F1-score from 0.506 to 0.632. These results highlight the efficacy of AUC maximization via numerical optimization in managing imbalanced datasets, providing an effective solution for enhancing predictive accuracy in detecting minority but crucial classes in out-of-sample datasets.",

      "text": "Electroencephalography (EEG) plays a critical role in the study of human brain function  [1] , offering valuable insights into cognitive  [2] , emotional  [3] , and motor processes  [4] . The ability to measure the brain's electrical activity in real-time with high temporal resolution makes EEG an indispensable tool in neuroscience and clinical diagnostics. Its application extends from understanding basic cognitive functions to complex tasks like emotion recognition, where EEG provides a direct window into the brain's response to various stimuli. Unlike other physiological signals, EEG is highly sensitive to the brain's intrinsic activities, offering a unique perspective on neural dynamics that cannot be easily captured through other modalities  [5, 6] . a combination of wavelet energy, modified energy, wavelet entropy, and statistical features with SVM, achieving accuracies of 84.95% for valence and 84.14% for arousal. Meanwhile, Li et al.  [20]  made contributions in feature engineering by using wavelet transforms and scalogram to structure multichannel neurophysiological signals. This method, combined with a hybrid deep learning model of CNNs and recurrent neural networks (RNNs), achieved accuracies of 72.06% for valence and 74.12% for arousal.\n\nAs technology advances, deep learning models such as deep neural networks (DNNs)  [21, 22]  and CNNs  [23, 24]  become more prevalent. Tripathi et al.  [25]  utilize DNNs and CNNs to classify emotions from the DEAP dataset, achieving accuracy of 81.41% and 73.36% in accuracy for valence and arousal, respectively. Cheah et al.  [26]  develop user-specific CNN models, achieving remarkable accuracies of 98.75% for valence and 97.58% for arousal in a three-class classification task. Some studies explore more complex deep learning architectures and optimization techniques  [27, 28] . For instance, Liu et al.  [29]  leverage a Bimodal Deep AutoEncoder (BDAE), outperforming existing methods with an average accuracy of 83.25% on multimodal tasks using the DEAP dataset.\n\nGao et al.  [30]  introduce the Channel-Fused Dense Convolutional Network (CDCN), significantly improving accuracy to 92.24% for valence and 92.92% for arousal. Kumar et al.  [31]  apply CNN and multilayer perceptron (MLP) models, achieving F1-scores of 94.5% and 94% for arousal and valence classes, respectively. Additionally, Zhang et al.  [32]  develop an attention-based hybrid model, which achieves accuracies of 85.86% for arousal and 84.27% for valence. Meanwhile, Zheng et al.  [33]  introduce an Adaptive Neural Decision Tree (ANT), achieving an impressive 99.14% average accuracy in binary classification tasks.\n\nComparison to Prior Works: Compared to the extensive prior research on the DEAP dataset (See Table  1  for a limited reference), which predominantly focuses on the accuracy of models in the two main categories of arousal and valence, our work targets the 'Liking' category. This category is notably characterized by an imbalanced data distribution (See Figure  1 ). Imbalance issues are observed in various domains, including cognitive science, where certain cognitive states may be less frequently represented, and in medical diagnosis, where certain diseases or conditions may be rare.\n\nFor example, in medical imaging, datasets often contain a majority of healthy images with only a small fraction depicting abnormalities, leading to challenges in training robust models  [34] . Despite the prevalence of such imbalances, many researchers continue to rely on machine learning methods trained on artificially balanced datasets. While this approach may yield high in-sample performance, it often results in poor out-of-sample generalization when the data distribution differs from the training set. Given that the 'Liking' category is imbalanced, our work primarily addresses this issue using numerical methods, specifically AUC maximization, to improve the detection accuracy of minority yet crucial classes. This approach is aimed at enhancing the precision of detecting these underrepresented but important categories, thereby ensuring better real-world applicability.",

      "text": "The DEAP dataset is widely used in studying the relationship between physiological signals and emotional states. The dataset consists of data from 32 participants who each watch 40 one-minute video clips, selected from an initial pool of 120 based on subjective emotional assessments. EEG signals are recorded using a Biosemi ActiveTwo system with 32 AgCl electrodes, following the international 10-20 system. Each participant's EEG data is captured across 40 channels, originally sampled at 512 Hz and later downsampled to 128 Hz. The data also undergoes preprocessing, including the removal of Electrooculography (EOG) artifacts and band-pass filtering between 4.0 and 45.0 Hz. Additionally, each video trial includes a 3-second pre-trial baseline, with the total recording per trial amounting to 63 seconds.\n\nThe dataset includes four primary emotion labels: Arousal, Valence, Dominance, and Liking.\n\nAmong these labels, arousal and valence categories are commonly used due to their relatively balanced distributions, facilitating effective model evaluation in machine learning and deep learning applications. However, the 'Liking' label is notably imbalanced (See Figure  1 ), with approximately one-third of scores below 5 and two-thirds above, presenting challenges for accurate model assessment.\n\nThis kind of label imbalance is typical in neuroscience and medical datasets, such as those related to Epilepsy, Dementia, Parkinson's disease, and Depression  [44, 45, 46] .\n\nA summary of the DEAP dataset and the channels utilized in our study can be seen in Table  2 . Given the imbalanced nature of certain features and their significance in detecting diseases, particularly those with fewer samples, it is crucial to develop methods that can effectively identify these cases within large datasets. Our objective is to employ advanced numerical optimization techniques to address these challenges and improve the predictive accuracy and reliability of models handling imbalanced datasets, thereby providing more robust tools for research and clinical applications in neuroscience and health.",

FFT is a computationally efficient algorithm that transforms a signal from its time domain into its frequency domain, allowing for the analysis of the signal's frequency components. Given a discrete time-domain signal x[n] of length N , the Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT) of the signal can also be expressed using Euler's formula as\n\nHere, the DFT is decomposed into its real part, represented by the cosine term, and its imaginary part, represented by the sine term. The FFT is an efficient implementation of the DFT, reducing the computational complexity from O(N 2 ) to O(N log N ), making it particularly suitable for analyzing large datasets like EEG signals. By applying the FFT, the EEG signal can be decomposed into its constituent frequencies, including theta (4-8 Hz), alpha (8-13 Hz), beta (13-30 Hz), and gamma  (30) (31) (32) (33) (34) (35) (36) (37) (38) (39) (40) (41) (42) (43) (44) (45) . Subsequently, the Power Spectral Density (PSD) is calculated for each frequency band within each sliding window segment. The PSD quantifies the power distribution of the signal over the different frequency components, providing insights into the underlying neural oscillations within each epoch. This feature is crucial for characterizing the energy present in specific frequency bands, which is often associated with various cognitive and emotional states  [47, 48, 49] .",

      "text": "The AUC metric evaluates classification model performance by measuring the area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve, reflecting the model's ability to differentiate between classes at various thresholds. Unlike traditional accuracy, which measures correct predictions irrespective of class distribution, AUC provides a comprehensive assessment across all thresholds, making it especially useful in imbalanced class scenarios. Most algorithms do not directly optimize AUC due to its non-decomposable and threshold-independent nature, using it instead as a post-training performance metric. However, AUC maximization can be approached through a strongly-convexstrongly-concave minimax optimization  [52, 53] , enabling direct optimization and offering a robust alternative to conventional loss functions focused on point estimates. In order to train a linear classifier w, the objective function can be written as\n\nwhere x = [w; u; v] ⊤ ∈ R nx , y ∈ R, λ is the regularization parameter and p denotes the proportion of positive instances in the dataset. The objective function f i (x, y) for each sample is defined as\n\nwhere a i ∈ R nx-2 are features and b i ∈ {+1, -1} is the label. Several numerical algorithms have been proposed to solve strongly-convex-strongly-concave minimax optimization problems. In Section 4.1, we introduce first-order algorithms, and in Section 4.2, we discuss a second-order framework for addressing such problems. In this paper, we only consider a linear classifier. However, this approach can be extensively applied to nonlinear models to achieve a better performance such as nonlinear models  [54, 27, 22 ] by replacing w with h(w; a j ).",

Traditionally, the Newton's method is represented as\n\nwhich achieves quadratic local convergence with a computational complexity of O(d 3 ) due to the computation of the inverse Hessian matrix, where d is the dimension of the Hessian matrix. Quasi-Newton methods alleviate this burden by approximating the inverse of the Hessian matrix iterative instead of direct computation  [59, 60] . However, quasi-Newton methods generally require the Hessian to be positive definite, which is impractical for saddle point problems.

Unlike traditional approaches that randomly select the update vector u from a standard normal distribution N (0, 1) as in  [52] , MGSR1 employs a greedy algorithm to select u by maximizing the ratio:\n\nThe selected u is then used in the SR1 update, improving the precision of the Hessian's inverse approximation.
