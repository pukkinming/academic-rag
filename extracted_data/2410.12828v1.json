      "text": "Sentiment analysis and emotion recognition in videos are challenging tasks, given the diversity and complexity of the information conveyed in different modalities. Developing a highly competent framework that effectively addresses the distinct characteristics across various modalities is a primary concern in this domain. Previous studies on combined multimodal sentiment and emotion analysis often overlooked effective fusion for modality integration, intermodalcontextual congruity, optimizing concatenated feature spaces, leading to suboptimal architecture. This paper presents a novel framework that leverages the multi-modal contextual information from utterances and applies metaheuristic algorithms to learn the contributing features for utterance-level sentiment and emotion prediction. Our Graph-enhanced Cross-Modal Infusion with a Metaheuristic-Driven Network (GCM-Net) integrates graph sampling and aggregation to recalibrate the modality features for video sentiment and emotion prediction. GCM-Net includes a cross-modal attention module determining intermodal interactions and utterance relevance. A harmonic optimization module employing a metaheuristic algorithm combines attended features, allowing for handling both single and multi-utterance inputs. To show the effectiveness of our approach, we have conducted extensive evaluations on three prominent multi-modal benchmark datasets, CMU MOSI, CMU MOSEI, and IEMOCAP. The experimental results demonstrate the efficacy of our proposed approach, showcasing accuracies of 91.56% and 86.95% for sentiment analysis on MOSI and MOSEI datasets. We have performed emotion analysis for the IEMOCAP dataset procuring an accuracy of 85.66% which signifies substantial performance enhancements over existing methods.",

      "text": "The social media evolution driven by the widespread adoption of mobile and networking technology, has undergone a remarkable transformation marked by an unprecedented surge in multimodal content and a significant increase in the volume of expressions observed on these platforms. Users effortlessly utilize videos  (Poria, Cambria, Hazarika, Majumder, Zadeh and Morency, 2017)  to convey a diverse set of expressions, reflecting their sentiments and emotions through the integration of text, audio, and visual data. This shift towards multimodal content  (Shi, Wu, Guo, Hu, Chen, Zheng and He, 2022)  underscores the need for refined methods and data analysis techniques to navigate the intricacies of human emotions embedded within multimedia content. Recognizing this evolving landscape, our research introduces a novel Video Sentiment Analysis and Emotion Recognition framework, as a solution to figure out the detailed reciprocation of human sentiments and emotions encapsulated in videos.",

      "text": "Traditionally, sentiment analysis and emotion recognition tasks were predominantly centered around unimodal approaches  (Zhang, Wang and Liu, 2018) , with a primary focus on textual content where the inter-relationships among words and phrases were considered. As social media evolved to include more multimodal content, the shortcomings of unimodal approaches  (Devlin, Chang, Lee and Toutanova, 2019 ) became more evident. Consequently, depending solely on textual content  (Gong, Teng, Teng, Zhang, Du, Chen, Bhuiyan, Li, Liu and Ma, 2020)  proves inadequate for extracting human sentiments, as the interpretation of speaker expressions often evolves dynamically, influenced   (Zhu, Zhu, Zhang, Xu and Kong, 2023) . This unimodal approach relying on text also posed challenges in understanding the intricate details conveyed through visual and audio data  (Yang, Xu and Gao, 2020) , as well as need of efficient techniques for fusion of these modalities.\n\nThe Video Sentiment Analysis and Emotion Recognition (VSAER) task aligns with the paradigm shift towards multimodality. It contrasts the traditional text-based approaches  (Zadeh, Chen, Poria, Cambria and Morency, 2017)  by incorporating information from various modalities, such as visuals and acoustics. This procedure is illustrated in a generalized way in Figure  1 . However, this integration presents a significant challenge due to the inherent heterogeneity of sentiment and emotional information across these modalities. Unlike unimodal analysis, where each modality carries consistent semantic meaning, multimodal signals in VSAER are often disparate. Text, for example, is composed of discrete words with specific meanings, while visuals and audio consist of continuous digital signals. This disparity necessitates a robust fusion framework to effectively integrate these heterogeneous sentiment sources which turns out as a crucial aspect in VSAER research domain.",

      "text": "Prior research works have emphasized the development of comprehensive sentimental and emotional representations, capturing intricate intra-modal and inter-modal interactions through fusion techniques and yielded notable advancements in VSAER tasks. As shown in Figure  1 , generic architectures utilize multi-input from a video and generate emotion or sentiment as output, where different fusion mechanisms are employed for cross-modal information extraction.\n\nConsidering these approaches, more concentration was on diverse fusion architectures to facilitate interactions within and between modalities. These approaches can be broadly considered feature-fusion-based, graph-based, and deep learning-based models. We investigated feature-fusion-based models such as THMM  (Tri-modal Hidden Markov Model)  by  (Morency, Mihalcea and Doshi, 2011)  that extracts features from all modalities, concatenates them, and passes through a tri-modal HMM classifier. The TFN (Tensor Fusion Network) proposed by  (Zadeh et al., 2017)  is based on the concept that learns both the intra-modality and inter-modality dynamics end-to-end using tensor fusion. The LMF (Low-rank Multimodal Fusion)  (Liu, Shen, Lakshminarasimhan, Liang, Zadeh and Morency, 2018)  model works by capturing the low-rank tensors for efficient multimodal representation. We then explored graph-based models  (Gong et al., 2020)  such as Adversarial Representation Graph Fusion (ARGF)  (Mai, Hu and Xing, 2014)  uses adversarial learning to refine representations with graph fusion. Multi-channel Attentive Graph Convolutional Network (MAGCN)  (Cheng, Wang, Tao, Xie and Gao, 2020)  combines multi-channel attention with graph convolutions for joint learning. Deep Learning model, COSMIC  (Ghosal, Majumder, Gelbukh, Mihalcea and Poria, 2020)  combines cross-modal similarities using a shared attention mechanism. The SIMR  (Wang, Wang, Lin, Xu and Guo, 2023)  learns shared multimodal representations while preserving modality-specific details. The AOBERT  (Kim and Park, 2023)  extends BERT for joint encoding of text and visual information.",

      "text": "Multimodal sentiment analysis models both intra-modal dynamics and inter-modal dynamics. Intra-modality dynamics represent interactions within a specific modality, such as interactions between words in a sentence. Intermodality dynamics denotes the interactions between different modalities. Current multimodal sentiment analysis methods struggle to concurrently quantify both intra-modal and inter-modal dynamics. To address this, we propose a novel technique that explicitly harnesses both types of dynamics. However, capturing these dynamics often presents a challenge with traditional fusion approaches.\n\nFurther, previous approaches, while applying attention solely to the contextual utterance for classification did not fully account for the correlations among the modalities of the target utterance and the context utterances, which in turn hindered the accurate distinction of the most relevant modalities for sentiment and emotion  (Liu, Gao, Li, Fu and Ding, 2023)  prediction of the target utterance. Consequently, this approach resulted in suboptimal multimodal feature representation when combining modalities from the context with those of the target utterance  (Huang, Pu, Zhou, Cao, Gu, Zhao and Xu, 2024) . We therefore extend our research, by building upon the strengths and constructively focusing on the limitations identified in earlier studies.",

      "text": "This paper introduces Graph-enhanced Cross-Modal Infusion with a Metaheuristic-Driven Network (GCM-Net) for VSAER tasks. GCM-Net employs four key modules for enhanced sentiment and emotion analysis: Graphbased Feature Recalibration and Enrichment (FRE), Intermodal Contextual Interaction Module (ICIM), Harmonic Optimization Algorithm (HOA), and a classifier module. FRE analyzes each utterance by building a network. It leverages modality-specific graphs to capture both temporal context and feature relationships with nearby features within each modality. This graph-based feature enrichment surpasses individual features alone, enabling more accurate cross-modal representation. Furthermore, FRE reconstructs features by graphically sampling and combining feature  (Zhao, Yang, Zhang and Wang, 2022)  relativity within the modality-specific graph network. By reconstructing these features, FRE encompasses a broader range of features surpassing the individual features that assist in improved inter-modality feature reconstruction. Further, we incorporate ICIM, which creates an amplified and more informative cross-modal feature representation. It computes pairwise attention scores between modalities, learning each modality's contribution to the overall sentiment and emotion. This cross-modal attention mechanism allows ICIM to capture interactions that might be missed by analyzing modalities independently. Finally, HOA is a metaheuristic approach that actively explores the solution space and selects an optimal subset of features. This effectively addresses data redundancy, which is a known challenge in late fusion approaches. HOA reduces dimensionality by selectively discarding irrelevant features, resulting in a compact and informative feature set. These optimized features are subsequently fed into a classifier, leading to demonstrably improved classification performance in comparison to the existing approaches.\n\nWe evaluate our Model on two subtasks: Multimodal Sentiment Analysis (MSA) and Multimodal Emotion Recognition (MER). Three public datasets are used: CMU-MOSI  (Zadeh, Zellers, Pincus and Morency, 2016) ,  CMU-MOSEI (Bagher Zadeh, Liang, Poria, Cambria and Morency, 2018) , and IEMOCAP  (Busso, Bulut, Lee, Kazemzadeh, Provost, Kim, Chang, Lee and Narayanan, 2008) . The experimental results demonstrate that our model outperforms the existing techniques. Furthermore, the ablation study and further analysis prove the effectiveness of different components of our proposed model. Our main contributions to this paper are summarized as follows:\n\n• We propose a unified video sentiment and emotion analysis framework named Graph-enhanced Cross-Modal Infusion with a Metaheuristic Driven Network for Video Sentiment and Emotion Analysis (GCM-Net).\n\n• This novel framework integrates a graph-based modality-specific feature recalibration approach to capture intricate details often unexamined by approaches based on early fusion techniques.\n\n• We incorporate a Intermodal Contextual Interaction Module to dynamically assign weights to each modality's representation based on its significance in the fusion process. This ensures each modality contributes most effectively in the model training phase.\n\n• We employ a harmonic optimization algorithm, to efficiently identify the optimal feature subset using a population-based metaheuristic approach. This solves the data redundancy challenge in late fusion models.\n\n• Extensive experimental analysis on three benchmark datasets demonstrates that our proposed mode, GCM-Net model effectively addresses limitations of previous work and exhibits improved efficiency and generalizability compared to existing approaches.\n\nThe organization of this paper is as follows: Section 2 provides an overview of the related work, discussing the current state-of-the-art research on multimodal sentiment and emotion prediction. The problem formulation is explained in Section 3. Furthermore, in Section 4 we illustrate our proposed approach and implementation details to cater the problem definition. The are provided in Section 5 presents experimental results conducted on public datasets to show the performance and robustness of the proposed architecture.

      "text": "This section explores deep learning approaches for sentiment or emotion analysis, particularly in the context of dialogue scenarios where sentiment interactions are often more complex. Capturing the subtle sentiment associations between participants in a conversation remains a significant challenge.  Hazarika et al. (Hazarika, Poria, Mihalcea, Cambria and Zimmermann, 2018)  proposed an interactive conversational memory network (ICMN) that leverages global memories to generate contextual summaries, facilitating multimodal sentiment detection. Zhang et al.  (Zhang, Li, Song, Zhang1 and Wang, 2019)  introduced a novel quantum-inspired interactive network (QLM) that combines elements of quantum theory with Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks  (Rajagopalan, Morency, Baltrusaitis and Goecke, 2016)  to capture both intra-utterance and inter-utterance interaction dynamics. Additionally, Ghosal et al.  (Ghosal et al., 2020)  presented the COSMIC framework, which incorporates commonsense reasoning to learn the interrelationships between speakers in a conversation.\n\nThe emergence of deep learning technologies has significantly impacted various research fields due to their impressive performance. Among these, the Transformer model, renowned for its application in machine translation, has garnered considerable attention. This sequence-to-sequence architecture leverages solely attention mechanisms, eschewing recurrent and convolutional structures. Notably, the Transformer establishes associations between each element within a sequence during sequential data modeling and context mining, leading to superior accuracy, stability, and speed. Consequently, researchers are actively exploring its potential in diverse domains beyond machine translation.\n\nThe Transformer model has been applied to unimodal representation correlation in a multiple research works. To record the interactions between multimodal sequences at various time steps, Tsai et al.  (Tsai, Bai, Liang, Kolter, Morency and Salakhutdinov, 2019) used a Multimodal Transformer (MulT) . The Transformer has additionally shown promise in merging unimodal features for emotion analysis.  Rahman et al. (Rahman, Hasan, Lee, Zadeh, Mao, Morency and Hoque, 2020)  used huge pre-trained Transformers for multimodal information integration, while Delbrouck et al.  (Delbrouck, Tits, Brousmiche and Dupont, 2020 ) used a Transformer framework to combine several unimodal representations for multimodal emotion analysis(MER).\n\nRecent advancements include the work of  (Wang et al., 2023)  which suggested a Transformer-based multimodal encoding-decoding translation network that prioritizes textual data using a combined encoding-decoding strategy, is one example of recent advances. The Speaker-Independent Multimodal Representation (SIMR) framework was established by  (Wang et al., 2023)  to minimize the impact of customized speech and visual elements. This approach employs a Cross-modal Transformer module to concurrently identify compatible and incompatible cross-modal interactions, splitting nonverbal inputs into style encoding and content representation. Additionally, All-modalities-inone Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (AOBERT), a single-stream Transformer pre-trained on two tasks concurrently, was presented by  (Kim and Park, 2023)  to capture linkages and dependencies between modalities. When taken as a whole, this research demonstrates how promising the Transformer approach is as a basis for multimodal sentiment analysis.\n\nFurthermore, to address challenges in multimodal emotion recognition (MER),  Dai et al. (Dai, Liu, Yu and Fung, 2020 ) present the EmoEmbs model, which introduces a modality-transferable approach using emotion embeddings. This model learns mapping functions to translate pre-trained word embeddings into visual and auditory spaces, hence representing emotion categories for textual input. The model determines the representation distance for each modality between the goal emotions and the input sequence and then uses this distance to forecast outcomes. This approach's reliance on pre-trained word embeddings may result in suboptimal performance for non-textual modalities.",

      "text": "Modality fusion-based methods  (Dai, Yan, Cheng, Duan and Wang, 2023)  for VSAER involves combining information from multiple modalities, such as audio, visual, and textual data, to achieve improved sentiment understanding. These methods can be broadly categorized into three main approaches: tensor-based fusion, translationbased fusion, and attention-based fusion.\n\nTensor-based fusion leverages tensors to represent and combine multimodal features. Representative models include the Tensor Fusion Network (TFN)  (Zadeh et al., 2017)  and Low-rank Multimodal Fusion (LMF)  (Liu et al., 2018) . TFN employs a three-fold Cartesian product for multimodal representation fusion, while LMF focuses on optimizing fusion efficiency and temporal modeling. However, these methods may prioritize low-level features over contextual information, potentially hindering their performance in complex scenarios like dialogue analysis.\n\nTranslation-based fusion approaches multimodal sentiment analysis by translating representations from one modality to another. The Multimodal Cyclic Translation Network (MCTN)  (Pham, Liang, Manzini, Morency and Póczos, 2018)  exemplifies this approach, where representations are iteratively translated between modalities to learn increasingly discriminative joint representations. While MCTN enhances robustness to missing or corrupted modalities, the cyclic translation process can be computationally expensive and time-consuming.\n\nAttention-based fusion utilizes attention mechanisms to selectively focus on relevant information from each modality during the fusion process. Models like the Multi-attention Recurrent Network (MARN)  (Li, Wang, Tan, Zeng, Ou and Zheng, 2020) , Recurrent Attended Variation Embedding Network (RAVEN) Huang, Dong, Wang, Hao, Singhal, Ma, Lv, Cui, Mohammed, Liu, Aggarwal, Chi, Bjorck, Chaudhary, Som, Song and Wei, and modalutterance-temporal attention (MUTA)  (Tang, Xiao, Zhou, Li, Chen and Li, 2023)  fall under this category. Attentionbased methods generally outperform other fusion approaches in sentiment analysis and emotion recognition tasks. However, their parallel structure might neglect the inherent coherence of human emotions, and simple concatenation techniques commonly employed may overlook modality-specific information.\n\nMoreover,  (Dai, Cahyawijaya, Liu and Fung, 2021a)  proposed a MESM that builds a fully end-to-end model that connects and jointly optimizes the two phases for the Multimodal emotion recognition (MER) task. Here they rearrange the current datasets to make end-to-end training easier. The feature extraction process made use of a sparse cross-modal attention mechanism in order to minimize the computing overhead caused by the end-to-end model. However, one shortcoming of this approach is that the rearrangement of datasets might limit its generalizability to other datasets or real-world scenarios.",

In contrast to conventional models, GNNs depict data as expressive graphs, in which nodes stand for distinct modalities and edges show how they interact. GNNs can discover hidden dependencies and acquire richer representations thanks to this graph-based method, which eventually improves sentiment prediction accuracy.\n\nSeveral recent studies have exhibited the efficacy of GNNs by using a hierarchical graph neural network to build the encoded multimodal representation fusion, the Adversarial Representation Graph Fusion model (ARGF)  (Mai et al., 2014)  uses adversarial training to overcome the modality distribution gap. For learning in-depth intra and intermodal temporal relationships, the multimodal graph network turns unaligned sequences into a graph and uses cuttingedge graph convolution and pooling methods. Moreover, the Multi-channel Attentive Graph Convolutional Network (MAGCN)  (Cheng et al., 2020)  integrates sentiment-related knowledge into inter-modality feature representations by utilizing multi-head self-attention and densely connected graph convolutional networks to capture inter-modality dynamics. Further, in addition to graph neural network and attention, our model effectively capitalizes the modality fusion, intermodal contextual congruity, and suboptimal feature space optimization that facilitates enhanced video understanding and classification.",

      "text": "We compare the performance of GCM-Net with the existing methods on three benchmark datasets. The performance over sentiment analysis is evaluated on CMU-MOSI and CMU-MOSEI datasets, whereas the IEMOCAP dataset is leveraged for the emotion analysis task.\n\n(a) Performance on CMU-MOSI and CMU-MOSEI for Sentiment Analysis: In assessing the efficacy of our proposed model for multimodal sentiment analysis, we conducted a comparative analysis with existing methods, as per prior research practices.   (Zadeh et al., 2017)  0.7460 0.7450 0.7560 0.7550 MARN  (Li et al., 2020)  0.7710 0.7700 0.7930 0.7780 MFN  (Gan et al., 2024)  0.7740 0.7740 0.7990 0.7910 MISA  (Hazarika et al., 2020)  0.8180 0.8187 0.8360 0.8380 SIMR  (Wang et al., 2023)  0.8610 0.8610 0.8320 0.8320 MCMF  (Li et al., 2023)  0.8843 0.8843 0.8616 0.8588 GCM-Net 0.9266 0.9444 0.8657 0.8923 The performance evaluation encompasses metrics such as accuracy and F1-score on the CMU-MOSI dataset, and the results are presented in Table  2 . The tabulated data clearly illustrates that our model surpasses previous stateof-the-art approaches on the specified dataset by a significant margin. Specifically, GCM-Net exhibits a noteworthy improvement of 18.06% and 19.94% in accuracy and F1-score, respectively, over TFN. This enhancement is attributed to the utilization of graph-based feature reconstruction, which considers temporal context and interrelations with neighboring features.\n\nIn contrast, TFN relies solely on late fusion, limiting its capacity to learn intricate inter-modality associativity. Furthermore, in comparison to early fusion techniques like MFN, our model demonstrates a performance boost of 15.26% and 17.04% in accuracy and F1-score. Overcoming the challenge of feature redundancy in MFN, our model employs a metaheuristic algorithm for feature selection, focusing only on crucial features for sentiment prediction.\n\nConsidering the MCMF model, which leverages correlation information between modalities at various levels, our model showcases superiority with improvements of 4.23% and 6.01% in accuracy and F1-score. Additionally, our model exhibits advancements of 10.86% and 12.57% in accuracy and F1-score, respectively, over MISA. The increasing accuracy trend is illustrated in Figure  5 . These significant improvements in both metrics across various existing methods underscore the competitive edge and effectiveness of our proposed technique.   2 , reveal the consistent superiority of our proposed model over existing benchmarks.\n\nNotably, GCM-Net achieves an impressive improvement of 11.37% in accuracy and 13.73% in F1-score over TFN. This notable advancement can be attributed to our model's adept utilization of graph-based feature recalibration, capturing temporal context and intermodal relationships effectively. Compared with early fusion techniques such as MFN, our model demonstrates a remarkable boost of 5.97% in accuracy and 10.13% in the F1-score. Addressing the challenge of feature redundancy, our model employs a metaheuristic algorithm for feature selection, enhancing its discernment of critical features for sentiment prediction. Considering the SIMR model, which exploits correlation information between modalities, our model showcases a substantial lead with improvements of 2.67% in accuracy and 6.03% in the F1-score. Additionally, our model exhibits advancements of 1.97% in accuracy and 5.43% in F1-score over MISA. As shown in Figure  6 , consistent improvements over these datasets underscore the robustness and effectiveness of our proposed model in handling diverse multimodal sentiment analysis tasks.",

      "text": "To justify the effectiveness of our suggested approach, we examine its results on the IEMOCAP dataset, which is well-known as a standard dataset for complex emotion identification problems.   (Dai et al., 2020)  0.7720 0.4980 MulT  (Tsai et al., 2019)  0.7760 0.5690 CMHA  (Zheng, Zhang, Wang, Wang and Zeng, 2023)  0.8420 0.5610 MESM  (Dai et al., 2021a)  0.8440 0.5740 FE2E  (Dai, Cahyawijaya, Liu and Fung, 2021b)  0.8450 0.5880 GCM-Net 0.8566 0.7269\n\nAs illustrated our model GCM-Net stands out, achieving remarkable advancements over prior methods. Compared to LF-LSTM, the prevailing benchmark, GCM-Net exhibits a significant stride of 13.86% in average accuracy and 23.19% in F1-score. This dominance extends to other competitive models like LF-TRANS, EmoEmbs, and MulT, demonstrating improvements of 6.86%, 8.46%, and 8.06% in accuracy respectively, alongside notable F1-score gains. Also, the popular approaches like CMHA, MESM, and FE2E, are outperformed by GCM-Net by 1.46%, 1.26%, and 1.16% in accuracy respectively, establishing a remarkable 15.29% lead in F1-score over FE2E. This comparison of performances is tabulated in Table  3 . The emotion prediction results highlight the effectiveness of our multimodal approach in identifying subtle inherent emotions in video data. Our chosen benchmark dataset, IEMOCAP  (Busso et al., 2008) , exhibits a class imbalance. While the dataset encompasses utterances categorized into four emotions, the distribution is uneven. Specifically, the number of utterances labeled as \"Happy\" significantly outnumbers those labeled as \"Angry\". Figure  7  provides recall, F1-score, and precision for each emotion category: Happy, Angry, Sad, and Neutral, all presented in decimal form for clarity.\n\nWe emphasize the tri-modal combination (A + T + V), which integrates acoustic, textual, and visual modalities. This comprehensive approach facilitates a deeper understanding of emotional expressions, leveraging the synergies between audio, textual, and visual modalities as shown in Figure  7 . This strategic integration enhances our model's ability to interpret and decode the inherent emotion of the utterances, showcasing the precision and depth of our analysis.",

We first examine the performance of GCM-Net with different modalities combinations followed by different attention mechanisms. Ultimately, we conduct experiments involving tri-modal inputs and gain a notably enhanced performance. This observation underscores the significance of employing a combination that integrates all three modalities, emphasizing its superiority in achieving improved results.\n\n(b) Feature Recaliberation using Graph Neural Network: We initiate by presenting the results of incorporating the Graph Neural Network in Table  5  that illustrate the impact of Feature Recalibration using Graph Neural Network in our architecture compared to a scenario without its implementation and different combinations of all the modules for drawing out better conclusions. The performance gain is expressed as the difference between the two approaches. Feature recaliberation significantly enhances accuracy, demonstrating its effectiveness in capturing complex relationships in multimodal data.   5 . We study the attention values to better understand the proposed architecture's behavior while learning. The outcomes that were achieved show that by applying distinct weights across separate modalities and contextual utterances, the model accurately predicts the labels of the experimented utterances. The utilization of Cross-Modal Attention contributes to a notable improvement in accuracy, emphasizing its role in capturing relevant features across diverse modalities.\n\n(d) Feature Selection using A𝛽HC Integrated HOA: Finally, we investigate the performance gain resulting from the integration of A𝛽HC encased HOA (Semantic Correspondence Attention) as illustrated in Table  5 . The integration of A𝛽HC encased HOA results in a substantial accuracy improvement, highlighting its effectiveness in capturing semantic correspondences and enhancing feature representations.\n\nIn the upcoming section, we will discuss about qualitative analysis carried out for our proposed model.",

      "section_name": "Qualitative Analysis",
      "text": "Multimodal sentiment analysis and emotion analysis approaches typically evaluate effectiveness by accurately classifying utterance data into corresponding sentiment or emotion classes. This section presents a qualitative analysis to assess our proposed model's performance in classifying data points within both sentiment and emotion categories. We showcase the qualitative results on the CMU-MOSI dataset for the sentiment analysis task and on the IEMOCAP dataset for the emotion analysis task. In Figure  8 , we first show the individual modality elements from the utterances illustrated by the audio plot, associated video frames, and its corresponding textual transcript. We perform a binary classification of sentiments through positive and negative labels and compare the inherent and the predicted sentiment class to evaluate the distinctive capability of GCM-Net. For emotion classification, we assess the emotions by portraying in a similar manner by classifying them into one among four emotion classes namely-Happy, Angry, Sad, and Neutral. The exhibited utterances were chosen from the test data, with yellow blocks representing accurately predicted data labels and red showing uncertainty in prediction. Here, accurately refers to the predicted sentiments that match the ground-truth labels of the utterances, and ambiguous refers to those that do not align with ground-truth labels. As illustrated in Figure  8 , GCM-Net performs excellently in the binary sentiment classification of the stated utterances. Although, in the IEMOCAP dataset, we encountered an instance where an \"Angry\" emotion was expressed through text conveying dullness and facial expressions appearing upset, where our model categorized it as \"Sad\". This case highlights the potential of complexities in multimodal emotion analysis  (Fu, Zhang, Yang and Yao, 2024) , where the model can sometimes deviate from the ground-truth class labels leading to ambiguity in prediction. Ultimately, in an overall sense, we see that GCM-Net shows better results with respect to considered tasks in comparison to the existing methods. Its ability to grasp inter-modal contextual information and optimal feature selection makes it ideal for combined sentiment and emotion classification.",

      "text": "This section explores various parameters in our proposed model. We examine the impact of four key parameters: the threshold for creating the similarity matrix (𝐾 𝑡ℎ𝑟𝑒𝑠ℎ𝑜𝑙𝑑 ), the dropouts in Bi-GRU layers, the number of agents and iterations in the Harmonic optimization Algorithm (HOA) for feature selection (represented as 𝑀 𝑎𝑔𝑒𝑛𝑡𝑠 and 𝑀 𝑖𝑡𝑒𝑟𝑎𝑡𝑖𝑜𝑛𝑠 respectively), and specific parameters in ConvXGB. For 𝐾 𝑡ℎ𝑟𝑒𝑠ℎ𝑜𝑙𝑑 , the optimal value yielding the best results was found to be 0.7. Values below 0.7 were disregarded as they provided insufficient similarity for relevant details, resulting in reduced data redundancy. Higher values led to a sparse matrix with limited utility. We integrated modality-specific Bi-GRU with 300 neurons each, followed by dense layers of 100 neurons (MOSI) and 128 neurons (MOSEI and IEMOCAP) to standardize the input dimensions across modalities. Dropout regularization was optimally set to 0.7 (MOSI & IEMOCAP) & 0.5 (MOSEI) for overall regularization, and 0.5 for Bi-GRU layers.\n\nFurther, the value of 𝑀 𝑎𝑔𝑒𝑛𝑡𝑠 was set to 4, and value of 𝑀 𝑖𝑡𝑒𝑟𝑎𝑡𝑖𝑜𝑛𝑠 to 100 to leverage the local search algorithm extensively for optimal feature selection. Lower values for 𝑀 𝑎𝑔𝑒𝑛𝑡𝑠 and the 𝑀 𝑖𝑡𝑒𝑟𝑎𝑡𝑖𝑜𝑛𝑠 parameters were deemed insufficient for meaningful comparisons and obtaining an optimized feature set. Finally, Extreme Gradient Boost parameters, particularly alpha and gamma, values of 0.6 and 0.5 respectively were chosen for the emotion classification task. This decision was influenced by the class imbalance in the dataset.",
