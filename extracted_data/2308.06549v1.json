      "text": "The traditional dietary recommendation systems are basically nutrition or health-aware where the human feelings on food are ignored. Human affects vary when it comes to food cravings, and not all foods are appealing in all moods. It takes a lot of effort to learn people's food preferences and make recommendations based on their affects and nutrition. A questionnaire-based and preference-aware meal recommendation system can be a solution. However, automated recognition of social affects on different foods and planning the menu considering nutritional demand and social-affect has some significant benefits over the questionnaire-based and preference-aware meal recommendations. A patient with severe illness, a person in a coma, or patients with locked-in syndrome and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) cannot express their meal preferences. Therefore, the proposed framework includes a social-affective computing module to recognize the affects of different meals where the person's affect is detected using electroencephalography signals. EEG allows to capture the brain signals and analyze them to anticipate affective state toward a food. In this study, we have used a 14-channel wireless Emotiv Epoc+ to measure affectivity for different food items. A hierarchical ensemble method is applied to predict affectivity upon multiple feature extraction methods and TOPSIS (Technique for Order of Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solution) is used to generate a food list based on the predicted affectivity. In addition to the meal recommendation, an automated menu planning approach is also proposed considering a person's energy intake requirement, affectivity, and nutritional values of the different menus. The bin-packing algorithm is used for the personalized menu planning of breakfast, lunch, dinner, and snacks. The experimental findings reveal that the suggested affective computing, meal recommendation, and menu planning algorithms perform well across a variety of assessment parameters.",

      "text": "H UMAN eating habits and preferences are difficult to anticipate because of diversity in food and human choices. However, menu planning and food recommendation systems are necessary for enabling a healthy lifestyle and well-being  [1] . A menu planning and food recommendation system should consider human feelings on a diet along with the nutritional value of the food menu  [2] . Even though a food recommender system recommends the most healthy diet, people will follow it only when the recommended food appeals to the user's taste buds  [3] .\n\nPatients affected with locked-in syndrome go under complete paralysis  [4]  and unable to express preferred meals. The disease Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) affects nerves of the brain and gets a person towards paralysis, and loss of motor function  [5] . People affected by these types of diseases can not express their preference for foods. In this regard, neural signature-based food recommendations could be a more potent solution. Unfortunately, none of the state-of-the-art food recommendation systems consider the human affect on different foods and do not even use neural signatures for computing food affect.\n\nThe role of affective behaviour in recommender systems and decision-making is presented in  [6]    [7] . Although quantifying human affects are challenging, and many researchers successfully classify human affects through \"Affective computing\"  [8]  from electroencephalography signals (EEG)  [9]  and facial expressions  [10] . This research also used EEG signals to determine human affects on different foods. Moreover, this research will answer the following research questions:\n\n• How human affects on different foods can be extracted by analyzing the brain's spontaneous electrical activity?\n\n• How a personalized food menu can be recommended considering the subject's calorie requirements, affective preferences, and nutrition value of the food menu?\n\nAccording to  [11] , in certain emotional states, obese people intake more food than a person with normal weight. Therefore, the primary objective of this research is to develop a system that can assist users by recommending meals based on the person's emotions. By incorporating the real-time emotion detection process, the proposed system will prepare meal plans that are compatible with the users' feelings. In addition to that, a full-day meal planning system has also been proposed that incorporates both emotion and nutritional data.\n\nTable  1  shows that most state-of-the-art meal recommendation systems  [12]  [13]  [14]  [15]  [16]  are nutritional information and preference based. However, the important affects e.g., feelings and excitement of humans on different foods were not considered in food recommendations. Moreover, none of the recommender systems had considered neural signature-based methods for the automated extraction of human food preferences. Therefore, this research proposed Affective computing-based Meal Recommendation and menu Planning social system (AMRP). The key contributions of this research are as follows:\n\n• A meal recommendation and diet planning system has been proposed for an individual considering human affect toward that food, the nutritional value of the food, and the calorie requirement of the individual.",

      "text": "The recommender system is a well-studied research domain and there are numerous recommendation engines for product recommendations, book recommendations, and movie or content recommendations. However, meal or food recommendation is different than the traditional recommendation engine because of the diversity of foods, people's choices, human feelings on foods, food nutrition, and individuals' diet requirements. A few pieces of research have been done on food recommendations where dietary preferences were learned through their online activity including ratings  [30]  [21]  [31] [32] , previous recipe selections  [22]  [27] as well as browsing history  [33]    [34] .\n\nRibeiro et al., presented SousChef, a mobile supper recommender framework to assist older adults by providing a nutrition companion to guide them in making wise judgments about nourishment administration and healthy eating practices  [14] . Their target demographic was senior adults who typically struggle to make good judgments about meal preparation, healthy eating, and grocery shopping. Studies also suggest that many older adults neglect nutrition and are more inclined to do so if they happen to live alone  [35] . The meal suggestion system was created to provide tailored nutritional programs based on the user's knowledge, which included personal preferences, activity level, and anthropocentric measurements (weight and height).\n\nJiang et al., developed \"Market2Dish,\" a personalized health-aware food recommendation system that aids the user in developing a healthy eating habit  [36] . In this method, the ingredients are first studied by identifying them in micro-videos obtained from the market, then the user's health is observed by gathering data from their social media accounts, and finally customised healthy foods are recommended. Moreover. user's pathological report based diet recommendation system is proposed in Diet-Right  [25] .\n\nGao et al., proposed the Progressive Attention-based Nourishment Suggestion (HAFR) system, which is capable of 1) capturing the collaborative sifting impact, such as what comparative clients tend to eat; 2) inferring a user's preference at the ingredient level; and 3) learning user preference from the recipe's visual images  [37] . Food proposals were characterized as an interactive media assignment in this work by taking into account user-recipe intuitive, culinary photos, and food ingredients. This paper suggested a system for inducing users' preferences for meal suggestions based on recipes.\n\nHsiao and Chang, a multi-objective optimization based location-aware diet recommendation system is proposed in SmartDiet  [38] . The system suggests personalized meals and restaurants based on the user's daily nutritional requirements. To begin with, the system receives geographical coordinates from the user's portable gadget and arranges with food suppliers adjoining to the user's current area for securing accessible suppers and the corresponding nutrition actualities.\n\nThe majority of food journaling methods have a slow start and are difficult to maintain  [16] . Therefore a great work has been conducted by Yang et al., 2017 who has developed a personalized nutrient-based meal recommendation system that tackles the limitation of the cold-start problem by not depending on the user's dietary history  [16] . They employ a food image analysis model called FoodDist in this system to learn about a user's fine-grained food preferences by interacting with them through food photographs and answering visually based diet-related queries. This allows them to create customised meal recommendations for anyone with dietary constraints such as vegetarian, vegan, kosher, or halal.",

A slideshow containing pictures of 40 different foods was used as stimuli (Figure  3 ). Each food picture was shown for 10 seconds. To overcome the effect of one picture to the next, we placed a calm scenario for 17 seconds after every food picture. In the mean time, the participants completed self assessment of Likeness, Valence and Arousal for the food.\n\nWe put the headset directly on the participant's scalp to record the EEG data. The whole environment was set up in a quiet and distraction-free area to obtain the participants' complete concentration, and they were also instructed to keep their muscle movements as minimum as possible.\n\nA set of 40 images (Figure  3 ) were shown to the volunteers to record their neural response through EEG. These images were carefully chosen and set up in a sequential manner considering their nutrition value, popularity among certain age groups, and availability. The food slide covered heavy meals as well as light appetizers. All kinds of meals were presented, from common fast foods like burgers and pizza to everyday essentials like rice and chicken curry. A wide range of drinks choices like soft drinks, laban (watered down yoghurt drink), milk-saffron drink, etc., were also included in the slide to get an overall balanced response.",

[39] , the frontal part of our brain is liable for positive and negative emotions.\n\nWhile the right frontal brain picks the negative emotions, the left frontal brain is associated with positive emotions.

      "text": "In a research conducted by (Al-Fahoum Al-Fraihat, 2014), it has been stated that signal noise which is captured during the recording of EEG signals, can affect the meaningful features of the signal  [42] . According to the studies of  (Cvetkovic, Übeyli & Cosic, 2008) , features are used to recognize patterns without the loss of information being as low as possible  [43] . Feature extraction is the method of recognizing patterns in a signal.\n\nIn this research, we used three feature extraction methods: Discrete Wavelet Transform(DWT), Short Time Fourier Transform(STFT), and with Hilbert-Huang Transform(HHT). These extraction methods helped us to reduce the number of features presented in our obtained dataset.\n\nWhen a signal is analyzed, it is converted into different frequencies like delta, alpha, beta, gamma, and theta. It represents the change of phase and magnitude in the frequency bands. The power spectral density (PSD) of the EEG signal is shown in Figure  4.  3.1.4.1 Short Time Fourier Transform (STFT) The sinusoidal frequency of a signal has been determined using this feature extraction method over time. This method is applied to specify the complexity of the amplitude of a signal against the time and frequency of a signal. The method entails performing a Fourier transform on a tiny segment of data at a time, which converts the signal into a 2D time and frequency function. This process can be expressed through the following equation 1. Figure  5  demonstrates spectrograms of the STFT feature extraction method for different ratings of three affectivity. For example, Like (a) is rated as 1, and Like (b) is rated as 2. Similarly,   [42] . The DWT of a signal x is calculated by passing it through a series of filters. The approximation coefficients are then split into a coarser approximation (low-pass) and high-pass (detail) component at each subsequent step. The samples are first convolutioned by passing them through a low pass filter with an impulse response. This extraction method can be written as 2. Figure  6  shows the raw signal for the first 10 seconds and its corresponding wavelet signal.\n\n3.1.4.3 Hilbert-Huang Transform (HHT) HHT is a two step method that uses Empirical Mode Decomposition (EMD) method to decompose the signal into Intrinsic Mode Functions (IMF) and applies Hilbert Spectral Analysis (HSA) to get the frequency data. Sifting is the process of extracting IMF from the EMD components. In our research, we used the HHT method to obtain the energy frequency-time distribution. This can be expressed as the following equation 3. Hilbert spectrum using HHT feature extraction from first 10 seconds of RAW signal is shown in Figure  7  x a = F -1 (F (x)2U ) = x + iy\n\n(3) Fig.  7 : HHT spectrum for first 10 seconds of signal",

The affective states are predicted through EEG signals using hierarchical ensemble machine learning model. While the individual classification algorithms did not perform well, introducing voting classifier, hierarchical ensembling had a great impact on the affective state classification. Due to higher accuracy of the models, food recommendation using TOPSIS becomes more promising. Sequentially, menu planning for a whole day has been more reliable and preference-centric.There is future scope to introduce deep learning based feature extraction method as well as Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) as affectivity classifier.",
