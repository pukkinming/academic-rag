      "text": "Multi-modal conversation emotion recognition (MCER) aims to recognize and track the speaker's emotional state using text, speech, and visual information in the conversation scene. Analyzing and studying MCER issues is significant to affective computing, intelligent recommendations, and human-computer interaction fields. Unlike the traditional single-utterance multi-modal emotion recognition or single-modal conversation emotion recognition, MCER is a more challenging problem that needs to deal with more complex emotional interaction relationships. The critical issue is learning consistency and complementary semantics for multi-modal feature fusion based on emotional interaction relationships. To solve this problem, people have conducted extensive research on MCER based on deep learning technology, but there is still a lack of systematic review of the modeling methods. Therefore, a timely and comprehensive overview of MCER's recent advances in deep learning is of great significance to academia and industry. In this survey, we provide a comprehensive overview of MCER modeling methods and roughly divide MCER methods into four categories, i.e., context-free modeling, sequential context modeling, speaker-differentiated modeling, and speaker-relationship modeling. In addition, we further discuss MCER's publicly available popular datasets, multi-modal feature extraction methods, application areas, existing challenges, and future development directions. We hope that our review can help MCER researchers understand the current research status in emotion recognition, provide some inspiration, and develop more efficient models.

      "text": "With the development of the mobile Internet, social media has become the main platform for people to communicate with each other  [74] . Users can fully express their emotions through multimodal data such as text, voice, image, and video. Building an multi-modal conversational emotion recognition model through multi-modal data is of vital practical significance for understanding users' true emotional intentions  [21] . Therefore, researchers have been trying to give machines the ability to understand emotions in recent years  [51] ,  [132] .\n\nBefore the rise of multi-modal conversation emotion recognition research, early conversational emotion recognition methods  [41, 62, 104, 131]  mainly focused on single-modal text or speech, and they only considered the context dependencies between texts (or speech) and the semantic information of words (or audio) themselves to analyze and recognize emotions  [71] ,  [118] ,  [94] . However, only extracting the emotional information contained in the text data may not be enough for the model to understand the emotion expressed by the speaker, because the speaker may be more reserved when expressing his opinion  [20, 133] . For example, a speaker may be veiled in expressing his anger, which may result in a more neutral utterance. In response to the above problems, multi-modal conversational emotion recognition (MCER) technology was proposed to solve the problem of insufficient expression of text semantic information  [92] ,  [91] ,  [118] . As shown in Fig.  1 , MCER aims to extract semantic information complementary within and between modalities and identify the emotions expressed by speakers in text, audio, and video. The advantage of MCER is that when the emotional polarity of text information is insufficiently expressed  [55] , the model can use visual information (such as facial expressions, etc.) and audio information (such as tone, etc.) to enhance the emotional understanding of text information  [114] ,  [115] ,  [117] ,  [116] . However, unlike traditional single-utterance multi-modal emotion recognition or single-modal conversation emotion recognition, MCER is a more challenging issue that requires consideration of factors such as multi-modal context, dialogue scenarios, speaker's own emotional inertia, and interlocutor stimulation  [9, 127] . Powerful deep learning technology  [93]  enables MCER to recognize emotion by fusing semantic features with complex emotional interactions. Feature fusion in MCER mainly considers intra-modal contextual semantic information fusion and inter-modal complementary semantic information fusion  [36] . On the one hand, intra-modal contextual semantic information fusion refers to extracting the temporal and spatial dependencies of speaker feature representations in each modality. On the other hand, complementary semantic information fusion between modalities refers to using the interactive information between different modalities to enhance the emotional understanding ability of the model. MCER synergistically improves the effect of emotion recognition by fusing the characteristics of various modal data, which has important theoretical significance for processing and understanding multi-modal data  [29, 113, 130] .\n\nDespite more and more people being devoted to researching new models and methods for multimodal conversation emotion recognition  [9, 18, 59] , there is still a lack of understanding of the theoretical and methodological classification of multi-modal conversational emotion recognition, especially multi-modal conversational emotion recognition based on deep learning. To the best of our knowledge, this survey is the first comprehensive survey focusing on deep learning in multi-modal conversation emotion recognition. Existing surveys mainly focus on single-utterance multi-modal emotion recognition  [133]  or single-modal conversation emotion recognition  [11] . Therefore, with the rapid penetration of deep learning in various fields, multi-modal conversation emotion recognition methods based on deep learning have become a research hotspot and require timely and comprehensive investigation.\n\nBased on the above analysis, our survey summarizes the research work on multi-modal conversational emotion recognition. We first list some publicly available and popular datasets in the field of MCER, and list the commonly used feature extraction methods for each modality. Secondly, as shown in Fig.  2 , we roughly divide the MCER methods into four categories, i.e., context-free modeling, sequential context modeling, distinguishing-speaker modeling, speaker-relationship modeling. Third, we provide evaluation indicators for MCER experiments. Fourth, we give the applications and problems of MCER. Finally, we illustrate future research directions.\n\nThe contributions made in this paper are summarized as follows:\n\n• New Taxonomy: We provide a new taxonomy for multi-modal conversational emotion recognition. Specifically, we classify existing MCER methods into four groups: contextfree modeling, sequential context modeling, distinguishing-speaker modeling, and speakerrelationship modeling. • Comprehensive Review: This paper provides the most comprehensive review of deep learning and machine learning algorithms for MCER. For each modeling approach, we provide representative models and make corresponding comparisons. • Abundant Resources: We collect relevant resour-ces about MCER, including state-of-the-art models and publicly available datasets. This paper can serve as a practical guide for learning and developing different emotion recognition algorithms. • Future Directions: We analyzed the limitations of existing MCER methods and proposed possible future research directions in many aspects, such as the collaborative generation of multi-modal data, the deep fusion of multi-modal features, and the unbiased learning of multi-modal emotions.\n\nThe paper is organized as follows: Section 2 summarizes the publicly available and popular datasets in the field of MCER. Section 3 illustrates the background, definitions, and commonly used feature extraction techniques for MCER. Section 4 broadly divides MCER methods into four categories and analyzes their advantages and disadvantages. Section 5 summarizes some commonly used evaluation metrics for MCER tasks. Section 6 gives the performance of different algorithms on the IEMOCAP and MELD data sets. Section 7 discusses the real-life applications of MCER. Section multi-modal dataset for MCER. In the IEMOCAP dataset, ten theater actors express specific emotion categories (i.e., sad, neutral, frustrated, anger, happy, excited) through binary dialogue.

      "text": "Recognition. The emotion recognition method based on the dictionary is the earliest used for emotion recognition  [24] , which motivated early work on naive bayes method  [15] . With the widespread application of machine learning algorithms in classification tasks, the representative machine learning classification algorithm (SVM  [85] ,  [35] , and binary decision tree  [10] ,  [47] ,  [61] , etc) has also begun to shine in the field of emotion recognition. The above-mentioned method determines the category of emotion by learning the polarity and occurrence frequency of emotional words in the text, which is difficult to extract the semantic information and context information.\n\nEncouraged by the success of CNNs in the field of computer vision (CV), CNNs began to be migrated to text classification tasks and received extensive research attention  [39] ,  [44] ,  [42] . In 2017, Poria et al.  [78]  used LSTM for the first time to resolve dependencies between contexts. Since then, improvements, extensions and applications of LSTMs and GRUs have increased  [26] ,  [69] ,  [25] ,  [82] . Until recently, many GNN-based methods (e.g.,  [20] ,  [37] ,  [89] ,  [50] ,  [124] ) emerged. Apart from CNNs, RNNs, and GNNs, many alternative Transformer-based methods (e.g.,  [131] ,  [49] ,  [132] ) have been developed in the past decades. We detail the categories to which these algorithms belong in Section 4.\n\n3.1.2 Multi-modal Conversational Emotion Recognition Versus Traditional Machine Learning. MCER methods based on traditional machine learning  [85] ,  [10] ,  [47] ,  [61] ,  [57] ,  [35]  are closely related to hand-extracted features, which have attracted increasing attention from the data mining and emotion recognition communities. These methods aim to learn the feature embeddings of raw data for subsequent downstream tasks such as classification and clustering. The classic conversational emotion recognition method based on machine learning is to use support vector machine to map emotional features to a hyperplane and classify them  [85] ,  [3] . However, these methods require a large amount of high-quality labeled data.",

The CNN-based emotion recognition methods  [63] ,  [44] ,  [42]  are the first deep learning method to solve the emotion classification problem historically  [41] . These CNN-based methods employ convolutional filters to extract semantic features of text so that the model can use supervised learning to understand the meaning of text. Similar to machine learning algorithms, CNN can also map emotional features into vector space through mapping functions. The difference is that this mapping function is learned in an end-to-end manner. Since the convolution kernel extracts local receptive field information, CNN cannot contain contextual semantic information.",

These RNNbased methods usually use LSTM or GRU (to avoid gradient disappearance or gradient explosion) to extract semantic features including context. Similar to CNN, RNN can also map emotional features into vector space through mapping functions in an end-to-end manner.\n\n3.1.5 Multi-modal Conversational Emotion Recognition Versus Transformer.

At the current moment 𝑡, the model needs to infer the speaker's emotion based on the context information {𝑢 1 , 𝑢 2 , . . . , 𝑢 𝑡 -1 }. We assume that the context window size is set to 𝐾. The set of contextual utterances is defined as follows:\n\nWhen the context window size is 6, the speaker's contextual utterances and predicted utterances are shown in Table  4 .\n\nDefinition 2 (Dialogue graph) A dialogue graph is represented as G = {V, E, R, W}, where V is a set of nodes in the graph, E is a set of edges, 𝑣 𝑖 ∈ V represents the 𝑖-th node, 𝑒 𝑖 𝑗 = (𝑣 𝑖 , 𝑣 𝑗 ) ∈ E represents a directed edge from 𝑣 𝑖 to 𝑣 𝑗 , the relationship 𝑟 𝑖 𝑗 ∈ E represents that there is a dialog relationship between nodes 𝑣 𝑖 and 𝑣 𝑗 .

As shown in Table  5 , we count the multi-modal feature extraction techniques used by many deep learning methods.  distance to measure the similarity between words. Unlike traditional one-hot encoding methods, word embedding technology can map high-dimensional sparse feature vectors to low-dimensional dense feature vectors, thus saving a lot of computing resources and solving the problem that one-hot encoding cannot distinguish the semantic gap between words. A commonly used word embedding method is Word2Vec  [8] , which contains two different forms: CBOW  [21]  and Skip-gram  [13] . CBOW predicts the central word based on the surrounding words, and Skip-gram predicts the surrounding words based on the central word. Although the above methods can capture the semantic similarity between words, they require large datasets for training. Some recent studies use simple TextCNN  [41]  and GLOVE  [16]  to extract text features.

SVM is a machine learning algorithm for classification and regression whose optimization goal is to find a hyperplane (a straight line in two-dimensional space, and a hyperplane in high-dimensional space) that separates samples of different classes. Based on the above research, Perez-Rosas et al.  [75]  concatenate multi-modal features as input vectors and use SVM to classify utterances for emotion. SVM works better for binary classification problems, but is less effective in multi-classification problems, and is only suitable for training small-scale data sets. The formula of SVM is defined as follows:\n\nwhere\n\nrepresents the kernel function, 𝑁 is the number of the samples. 4.1.5 Multiple Kernel Learning. After preprocessing the features of three different modalities, Poria et al.  [77]  constructed two different feature selectors to achieve feature dimensionality reduction. One of the feature selectors is based on circular correlated feature subset selection (CFS), and the other is based on principal component analysis (PCA). The above two feature selectors can not only eliminate redundant information and noise information, but also improve the running speed of the model. After feature selection and dimensionality reduction, the researchers spliced and merged the processed feature vectors and trained a classifier using a multi-kernel learning (MKL) algorithm  [77] . Based on the previous research work, the authors further propose the Convolutional Recurrent Multi-kernel Learning (CRMKL)  [79]  model. CRNKL uses a convolutional recurrent neural network for emotion detection, which can extract contextual information. The formula of MKL is defined as follows:\n\nwhere 𝑦 𝑖 is the true label, 𝛼, 𝛽 are the learnable parameters, 𝑀 is the feature dimension.\n\n4.1.6 Select-Additive Learning CNN. CNN is a classic neural network in visual tasks and cannot be directly used for emotion recognition. In order to solve this problem, Kim et al.  [41]  proposed the TextCNN model, and its overall process is shown in Fig.  5 . In order to perform multi-modal emotion recognition, Wang et al.  [105]  proposed the SAL-CNN model, which first uses multi-modal data to fully train the CNN, and then uses Select-Additive Learning (SAL) to improve its versatility and prevent the model from overfitting during training. The SAL method consists of two phases (i.e., selection and addition). In the selection phase, SAL preserves important features and removes noisy information from the latent feature representations learned from neurons. In the addition phase, SAL improves the model's noise immunity by adding Gaussian noise to the feature representation. The SAL method improves the generalization performance of deep fusion models.\n\nThe formula for extracting text features by CNN is defined as follows:\n\nwhere ⊕ represents concatenation operator, 𝜔 represents convolution filter, 𝑐 𝑖 represents the feature representation within a window, 𝑓 (•) represents activation function. Convolutional filters are used to extract features from all sentences to generate feature maps:\n\nThe max pooling operation is used to capture the most critical semantic information in the sentence.\n\nIt can be seen from the processing flow of the convolutional neural network that using CNN to extract text features does not contain contextual information, i.e., it is assumed that each sentence is independent of each other.\n\n4.1.7 Tensor Fusion Network. The tensor-based feature fusion method mainly calculates the tensor product of different modal feature representations through Cartesian product to obtain the fused tensor representation  [73] . Therefore, the above methods need to first map the input multi-modal feature representation into a high-dimensional space, and then map it back to a low-dimensional tensor space for emotion representation. Tensor-based methods are able to capture important high-order interaction information across time, space, and modality. However, the computational complexity of tensor methods is very high and grows exponentially, and there is no fine-grained semantic information interaction between modalities. Zadeh et al.  [121]  proposed the multi-modal tensor fusion network TFN. TFN adopts the method of tensor fusion, which can simulate the interaction process between the three modalities of text, audio and video, and effectively fuse multi-modal features. Although TFN can effectively model information interaction within and between modalities, the model complexity of the TFN method is related to the dimensionality of multi-modal features and grows exponentially. The formula of TFN is defined as follows:\n\nwhere the extra dimension with 1 is used to perform modal interaction. The Cartesian product is then used to fuse the three modal features as follows:\n\nwhere ⊗ represents the outer product, 𝑥 𝑚 represents fused vectors.\n\n4.1.8 Low-rank Tensor Fusion Network. On the basis of TFN, in order to more efficiently fuse multi-modal data, Liu et al.  [60]  proposed a low-rank tensor method LFM to achieve dimensionality reduction of multi-modal features, so as to improve the fusion efficiency of multi-modal features as shown in Fig.  6 . LFM has achieved high performance on many different tasks.\n\nwhere w 𝑎 , w 𝑣 , w 𝑡 represents the decomposed low-rank learnable tensor.\n\n4.1.9 Data Augmentation with Generative Adversarial Networks. Multimodal emotion recognition based on adversarial learning is an advanced direction in this field, which combines the principles of adversarial learning to improve the accuracy and robustness of emotion recognition  [84] ,  [120] .\n\nNext, we introduce the existing overall process of data augmentation based on adversarial generative networks. 1) Conditional GANs Conditional Generative Adversarial Network (cGAN)  [98]  is a variant of GAN that introduces conditional information to more precisely control the output of the generator. The core idea of cGAN is to pass additional condition information to the generator and discriminator during the generation process, thereby generating specific types of data based on given conditions. The main advantage of cGAN is its ability to precisely control the generation process in order to generate data that meets the conditional information. The optimization goal of cGAN is defined as follows:\n\nmin\n\nwhere 𝑥 represents real data, and 𝑦 represents extra information.\n\n2) Adversarial Autoencoders Adversarial Autoencoder (AAE)  [46]  combines the ideas of Autoencoder and GAN. The main goal of AAE is to make this encoding space more continuous and have better data generation capabilities while learning a compressed representation of data. The training objective function of AAE usually includes two parts: one is the reconstruction error of the autoencoder, which is used to ensure the quality of the encoding, and the other is the GAN loss, which is used to make the encoding distribution more continuous and closer to the real distribution. The formula is defined as follows:\n\nwhere 𝑝 𝑧 (𝑧) represents the prior distribution.\n\n3) Adversarial Data Augmentation Network Adversarial Data Augmentation Network (ADAN)  [106]  includes the following components: autoencoder 𝑅(𝐸 (𝑥)), auxiliary classifier 𝐶 (𝐸 (𝑥)), generator 𝐺 (𝑧, 𝑦) and discriminator 𝐷 (ℎ). First, ADAN aims to learn a latent representation of the input data x in order to preserve the emotional information in it. Second, it attempts to ensure that the generated latent representation is consistent with the emotional information of the input data by matching the posterior distribution 𝑝 (ℎ|𝑧, 𝑦) with 𝑝 (ℎ|𝑥). Third, ADAN simultaneously strives to minimize the reconstruction error between the input data 𝑥 and its reconstructed version x to ensure high-quality data reconstruction. The generator 𝐺 (𝑧, 𝑦) accepts a sample 𝑧 drawn from an M-dimensional Gaussian distribution and a one-hot encoding of the emotion label 𝑦 as input, and the goal is to generate samples in the latent space such that they are indistinguishable from real samples. The discriminator 𝐷 (ℎ) is optimized to distinguish whether the latent vector ℎ comes from real data or from the generator.\n\nwhere 𝛼 determines the contribution of classification error to model optimization.",

      "text": "Context-free modeling is conceptually important and has inspired later research on sequential context modeling  [103] . In particular, sequential context modeling methods consider that contextual sentences are mutually influential. Sequential context modeling approaches  [64, 100, 111]  consider each sentence influenced by its surrounding utterances. The main idea is to generate a feature representation with rich contextual semantic information by combining its own utterance representation 𝑥 𝑖 with the surrounding contextual sentence representation\n\nwhere 𝑘 represents the context window size. Different from the context-free modeling method, the sequential context modeling method obtains a better feature representation by setting a memory network to preserve the context information of the sentence. Taking Fig.  7  as an example, a LSTM or Transformer is used to extract contextual information for three modalities of video, audio and text. The sequential context modeling approach plays an important role for many other MCER modeling approaches. LSTM is a variant of RNN that can remember contextual information. Specifically, LSTM models long-distance dependent context through cellular units and can solve the vanishing gradient problem. Each LSTM consists of input gate 𝑗 𝑡 , output gate 𝑂 𝑡 , cell state 𝐶 𝑡 , and forget gate 𝑓 𝑡 .\n\nwhere 𝜎 represents activation function.\n\nAfter LSTM was used in multi-modal conversational emotion recognition, many other works were proposed to extract contextual emotional information. Lu et al.  [63]  proposed a multi-scale LSTM multi-modal emotion recognition model, which uses LSTM to extract low-level and highlevel local emotional features in multi-modal features. This method can capture subtle changes in complex expressions in a more fine-grained manner and implement an information feedback mechanism. However, it cannot capture the status information of the utterance and the status information of the speaker. Existing models ignore modal alignment and directly fuse information on different modal features. Modal alignment can eliminate the heterogeneity of single-modal features and obtain accurate emotional representations of different modal features. Based on this current situation, Hou et al.  [29]  proposed a semantic alignment network based on multi-space learning, which uses LSTM to extract emotional features of different modalities and obtains high-level emotional representations as supervisory signals for modal alignment. This method can capture the global correlation between different modalities and achieve feature fusion between modalities.\n\nTransformers are another way of modeling sequential context  [36, 49, 132 ]. Transformer's longdistance modeling capabilities are far superior to recurrent neural networks like Bi-LSTM, and Transformer can achieve parallel computing. Therefore, existing research on multi-modal emotion recognition based on sequential context modeling often regards Transformer as an important technology. The implementation details of Transformer are as follows.\n\nFirstly, video, audio and text features (i..e., 𝑥 𝑡 , 𝑥 𝑎 , 𝑥 𝑣 ) are concatenated into a fusion vector. The formula is defined as follows:\n\nwhere 𝑄, 𝐾, 𝑉 represent the query vector, key vector and value vector of multi-modal features, respectively. Secondly, we use a feedforward neural network to perform multiple linear transformations on 𝑄, 𝐾, and 𝑉 . The formula is defined as follows:\n\nwhere 𝑚 represents the number of linear transformations.\n\nWe then perform multi-head attention in parallel to obtain emotion feature representation: where 𝐻 ℎ𝑒𝑎𝑑 represents the emotion feature vectors. Finally, we use sine and cosine position encoding to obtain the position information of the emotion sequence:",

In view of the inability of previous works to model long-distance dependencies between different modal features, Yang et al.  [113]  proposed a multi-modal speech emotion recognition method using context Transformer, which improves the emotional representation of the current utterance by embedding contextual information. This method can adaptively learn feature fusion between modalities.\n\nIn view of the fact that existing methods cannot dynamically identify subtle changes in emotion in multi-modal features and multi-scale features in different modal features, Liu et al.  [59]  proposed a multi-scale self-attention fusion emotion recognition method, which uses the self-attention mechanism to extract context-related dependencies in multi-modal features. Therefore, there is potential to use Transformers to model long-distance context dependencies. This method combines bc-LSTM and a multi-head attention mechanism to achieve fine-grained emotional information mining, and uses feature-level fusion and decision-level fusion methods to experiment with crossmodal feature fusion.",

      "section_name": "Distinguishing Speaker Modeling",
      "text": "The distinguishing speakers modeling method considers that the speaker's emotion is not only related to the global context, but also related to the speaker's own emotional state. Take Fig.  8  as an example, there are three GRU states (i.e., a global GRU, an emotional GRU and a speaker GRU). The global GRU is utilized to extract global multi-modal information and speaker's emotional state information. The speaker GRU is used to fuse the semantic information with context captured by the attention mechanism and the speaker's emotional state information. The emotion GRU combines the speaker's emotional state information and global context information to complete the final emotion classification.\n\nGlobal GRU captures the contextual semantic information of an utterance by modeling the utterance and speaker states. Each speaker state is used to memorize a speaker-specific representation of an utterance. By distinguishing the subordination relationship between speakers and utterances, it is beneficial to model the dependency relationship between speakers and utterances, thereby enhancing the semantic representation ability of context. The formula of Global GRU is defined as follows:\n\n𝑔 𝑡 = 𝐺𝑅𝑈 G (𝑥 𝑡 -1 , (𝑥 𝑡 ⊕ 𝑞 𝑠 (𝑥 𝑡 ),𝑡 -1 )) (23) where 𝑔 𝑡 represents the latent feature representation of the global state, 𝑞 𝑠 (𝑥 𝑡 ) represents the speaker state of the current utterance 𝑥 𝑡 .\n\nSpeakers typically reply to conversations based on contextual information from other speakers. Therefore, speaker GRU extracts the context 𝑐 𝑡 related to the utterance 𝑥 𝑡 . The formula is defined as follows:\n\nwhere 𝑊 𝛽 is the learnable parameters. We first calculate the attention score of the global state in the previous 𝑡 -1 time. The attention score give higher weight to utterances related to utterance 𝑥 𝑡 . The final context vector 𝑐 𝑡 is obtained by the dot product of the attention score 𝛽 and the global state 𝑔 𝑡 .\n\n𝑞 𝑠 (𝑢 𝑡 ),𝑡 = 𝐺𝑅𝑈 P (𝑞 𝑠 (𝑢 𝑡 ),𝑡 -1 , (𝑢 𝑡 ⊕ 𝑐 𝑡 ))\n\n(25) The emotional representation et of the utterance ut is obtained by combining the speaker's state 𝑞 𝑠 (𝑢𝑡 ),𝑡 and the utterance 𝑒 𝑡 -1 at time 𝑡 -1. One underlying intuition is that context has a greater impact on utterance 𝑢 𝑡 , and 𝑒𝑡 -1 integrates emotional contextual information from other parties' states into the emotional representation et. Therefore, we use the Emotion GRU unit to model 𝑒 𝑡 1 , and the formula is defined as follows:\n\nThe emotion representation 𝑒 𝑡 that combines context information and speaker status information is used for the final emotion classification.\n\nIn modeling methods based on distinguishing between speakers, Ghosal et al.  [19]  proposed COSMIC, which clarifies the relationship between the speaker and the utterance, and introduces common sense knowledge to enhance the emotional understanding of the model. COSMIC can learn a variety of different prior knowledge (e.g., event relationships and causal relationships, etc.), and can distinguish speaker information and dynamically detect the speaker's emotional changes.\n\nIn view of the fact that existing methods cannot pay attention to the correlation between utterances and speakers and the lack of interaction between speakers, Zhang et al.  [126]  proposed a conversational interaction model, which extracts contextual semantic information and state interaction information of utterances through stacked global interaction modules. In addition, this method also implements adversarial feature representation of the model by introducing noise information. Experimental results prove that adversarial learning can improve the performance of emotion recognition.",

      "text": "4.4.1 GNN for speaker relationship modeling. The speaker relationship modeling method innovatively introduces graph neural network to capture the speaker's dialogue relationship information while extracting sequential context information. Taking Fig.  9  as an example, it extracts dialogue relationships between speakers and inter-speaker dependencies by constructing a speaker relationship graph.\n\nGCN extends convolution operations into graph-structured data to extract structural information. GCN performs first-order neighbor information aggregation and spectral domain estimation. The formula of GCN is defined as follows:\n\nwhere 𝑾 (𝑙 ) is the learnable parameters, Ã = 𝐴 + 𝐼 𝑛 , 𝐼 𝑛 is the identity matrix, D𝑖𝑖 = 𝑗 ã𝑖 𝑗 . 𝑯 (𝑙+1) represents the latent feature representations of layer 𝑙 + 1.\n\nThe steps to apply GCN to the field of multi-modal emotion recognition are as follows. First, each utterance is represented as a node in the graph, and edge relationships are constructed based on the context between utterances (i.e., if there is a dialogue between utterances, an edge is constructed). We then apply GCN to the constructed dialogue graph for speaker-level information extraction. Through the above process, the model can dynamically learn the correlation between sentences. According to the definition of Equation  27 , our formula for aggregating surrounding contextual utterence information is deformed as follows:\n\nwhere 𝑊 𝜃 1 and 𝑊 𝜃 2 are the learnable parameters, N 𝑟 𝑖 represents the neighbor node under the relationship 𝑟 ∈ R.\n\nGAT is a variant of GCN that aggregates surrounding neighbor node features through learnable weights with an attention mechanism. GAT captures the more important node features in the graph by calculating the degree of similarity between nodes. The formula for GAT is defined as follows:\n\nwhere 𝛼 𝑖 𝑗 is the edge weight between node 𝑖 and node 𝑗.\n\nSimilarly, the formula for using GAT to extract conversational relationships between speakers is defined as follows:\n\nThe multi-modal method based on GNN is the current mainstream research, which can consider context information and speaker relationship information simultaneously  [20] . In order to jointly learn the three tasks of sequential context information, multi-modal information interaction and multi-task representation, Zhang et al.  [130]  designed a multi-modal, multi-task interactive graph attention network (M3GAT) to simultaneously model context dependencies, multi-modal emotional interactions, and speaker dependencies. M3GAT can achieve cross-modal feature interaction, capture of sequential contextual semantic information, and correlation between tasks.\n\nIn view of the fact that existing graph fusion methods will cause the model to lose important semantic information and fail to eliminate redundant information in the model, Li et al.  [50]  proposed a graph network based on cross-modal feature complementarity, which effectively extracts the speaker's context and interaction information through multiple hypothesis spaces of the graph. This method eliminates the heterogeneity between modalities and fuses modal information by performing different message aggregation on different nodes and edge relationships in the graph, thereby extracting contextual information and speaker relationship information.\n\nAlthough existing MCER methods use GCN to model conversational relationships between speakers. In particular, the most competitive methods model the dependence of conversational relations between speakers and the importance between conversational relations by using relational graph attention networks. However, existing GCN-based multimodal conversational emotion recognition methods do not consider conversational relationships and sequential information in contextual relationships. Based on the above problems, Ishiwatari et al.  [37]  introduced relational position coding in RGAT to provide sequence information. The specific flow chart of RGAT is shown in Fig.  10 .\n\nThe position encoding formula used by RGAT is defined as follows:\n\nwhere 𝑃𝐸 𝑖 𝑗𝑟 represents the relative position distance between node 𝑖 under relationship type 𝑟 and its surrounding neighbor nodes 𝑗. The maximum relative position distance between nodes is clipped to 𝑝 or 4 , which represents the context window size. N𝑟 (𝑖) represents the neighborhood of node 𝑖 under relationship type 𝑟 . In order to make the position encoding information learnable, FFN is used to obtain position embeddings.",

𝐸 𝑖 𝑗 means that the 𝑖-th sample in the 𝑗-th emotionally predicted correctly. 𝐸 𝑖 𝑗 ∈ [0, 1]. 𝑆 𝑚 𝑗 represents the 𝑚-th sample of the 𝑗-th emotion. The larger the value of 𝐴𝑐𝑐𝑢𝑟𝑎𝑐𝑦 𝑗 , the better the recognition effect of the model on the 𝑗-th type of emotion.\n\n2) The F1 value is the F1-score of each emotion, and the formula is defined as follows:\n\nwhere 𝐸 𝑗 𝑇 𝑃 is the number of samples that the model predicts correctly on the 𝑗-th category of emotion, 𝐸 𝑗 𝐹 𝑃 is the number of samples that the model predicts incorrectly on the 𝑗-th category of emotion, and 𝐸 𝑗 𝐹 𝑃 is the number of emotions from other categories that the model predicts as the 𝑗-th category of emotion. 𝑃𝑟𝑒𝑐𝑖𝑠𝑖𝑜𝑛(𝐸 𝑗 𝑇 𝑃 , 𝐸 𝑗 𝐹 𝑁 ) is the model's precision on the 𝑗-th category of emotion, and 𝑅𝑒𝑐𝑎𝑙𝑙 (𝐸 𝑗 𝑇 𝑃 , 𝐸 𝑗 𝐹 𝑃 ) is the recall of the model on the 𝑗-th emotion. f1 value combines the effects of both precision and recall metrics.

In particular, each algorithm uses multi-modal data, and we distinguish different MCER algorithms according to our classification method. Experimental results show that context-free based algorithms have the worst performance because they contain the least semantic information and cannot obtain good emotional feature representation. The multi-modal conversational emotion recognition algorithm based on sequential context has significant performance improvement compared to the context-free algorithm. The performance improvement may be attributed to the sequential context algorithm's ability to model the dependencies between contexts and its ability to utilize context information to improve the feature representation of emotions. The emotion recognition effects of modeling methods based on distinguishing speaker relationships and sequential context modeling methods are similar, and both are better than context-independent modeling methods. The performance improvement may be attributed to the ability of the distinguishing speakers modeling method to dynamically capture the speaker status information of the utterance and integrate it into the emotion representation information. The modeling method based on speaker relationship has the best performance and is currently the most popular modeling method. The modeling method based on speaker relationship mainly constructs the dialogue relationship between speakers through the inherent properties of the graph structure, and extracts the dialogue relationship representation between speakers through GCN. In addition, the speaker relationship modeling method can also consider the dependency information of the sequential context simultaneously.\n\nIn addition, we also counted the emotion recognition effects of different MCER algorithms on different emotion categories. As shown in Table  7 , on the IEMOCAP data set, the performance effects of each algorithm on various emotions are consistent with the overall results introduced previously. The method based on context-free modeling has the worst effect, with the recognition effect on the \"happy\" emotion being less than 50%. In comparison, most of the other three types of algorithms have exceeded 60%, and some categories of emotions have exceeded 80%. The performance of each algorithm on the MELD data set is shown in Table  8 . The recognition effects of each algorithm on most categories of emotions are similar to those on the IEMOCAP data set. It is important to note that we found that all emotion recognition methods have poor performance in identifying \"fear\" and \"disgust\" emotions, and the accuracy of some algorithms is even 0%. When we observe the distribution of the data set, we can find that the MELD data set has a serious data imbalance problem.

Small samples are difficult to drive unbiased learning of the model, which seriously affects the model's prediction accuracy for small sample emotional categories. Therefore, the unbalanced sample distribution limits the effectiveness of current multi-modal conversational emotion recognition models.",

However, the consistent semantic association of multi-modal conversation is more complicated and is not only related to the multi-modal context but also to factors such as the conversation scene, the speaker's own emotional inertia, and the speaker's stimulation. In addition, multi-modal data are heterogeneous, each modality has differentiated representation and distribution characteristics in space, and some consistent semantic associations are hidden in the feature distribution space between modalities. Therefore, efficiently performing consistent semantic association is the primary issue that needs to be considered at the model level.",

When sample data is scarce, training multi-modal conversation emotion recognition models without causing overfitting or underfitting problems is extremely challenging. However, the sample size of existing benchmark data sets is relatively small, and there is a common problem of data scarcity. Multimodal dialogue data generation can effectively alleviate this problem. However, the distribution of multi-modal conversation data is more complex, and traditional single-modal data generation or cross-modal data generation models cannot meet the requirements. Therefore, there is an urgent need to solve the problem of collaborative generation of multi-modal conversation data.",

Since multi-modal conversation data is heterogeneous and contains noise, there are significant differences in the temporal period and spatial distribution of different modal features, and the spatiotemporal importance between modalities is dynamic. Currently, few works consider this difference, and more efforts are still needed for deep fusion of multi-modal features.",

To allow readers to implement emotion recognition tasks better, we have collected popular data sets in this field and given relevant download links. Since text, video, and audio are unstructured data that cannot be directly input into a computer for computation, we summarize some publicly available feature extraction methods. We divide emotion recognition methods into four categories, i.e., context-free modeling, sequential context modeling, distinguishing speaker modeling, and speaker relationship modeling. This paper further discusses the challenges faced by existing methods and future research directions. According to the review of existing work, it is found that multi-modal emotion recognition mainly improves the effect of emotion recognition by modeling intra-modal and inter-modal complementary semantic information. We hope this review can shed some light on developments in this field.",
