      "text": "The research on human emotion under multimedia stimulation based on physiological signals is an emerging field, and important progress has been achieved for emotion recognition based on multimodal signals. However, it is challenging to make full use of the complementarity among spatial-spectral-temporal domain features for emotion recognition, as well as model the heterogeneity and correlation among multi-modal signals. In this paper, we propose a novel two-stream heterogeneous graph recurrent neural network, named HetEmotionNet, fusing multi-modal physiological signals for emotion recognition. Specifically, HetEmotionNet consists of the spatial-temporal stream and the spatial-spectral stream, which can fuse spatial-spectral-temporal domain features in a unified framework. Each stream is composed of the graph transformer network for modeling the heterogeneity, the graph convolutional network for modeling the correlation, and the gated recurrent unit for capturing the temporal domain or spectral domain dependency. Extensive experiments on two real-world datasets demonstrate that our proposed model achieves better performance than state-of-theart baselines.",

      "text": "Emotion is a mental and physiological state which results from many senses and thoughts  [10] . In recent years, emotion plays an increasingly important role in multiple areas, such as disease detection, human-computer interaction (HCI), and virtual reality. To collect data for emotion recognition, researchers often utilize multiple multimedia materials to stimulate participants and induce emotion. For the reason that videos, audio, and so on have the advantage of easy collection, there is a mass of studies using these data. Though they achieve certain performance, these data cannot guarantee to reflect a real emotional state since human can disguise their facial expression, sound, and so on. Physiological signals cannot be disguised, so they can reflect human emotion objectively. Therefore, physiological signals are more suitable for emotion recognition.\n\nTo achieve better performance for emotion recognition, some methods are proposed which use physiological signals and achieve  The graph of EEG signals. The graph method preserves the functional connectivity among the electrodes to the greatest extent and does not introduce noise.\n\nstate-of-the-art performance  [12, 34, 45] . However, several challenges still exist for emotion recognition using physiological signals.\n\nC1: How to utilize the complementarity among spatialspectral-temporal domain information efficiently. Temporal domain information and spectral domain information in the spatial domain of physiological signals usually have different activation degree. For example, Figure  1  indicates the differences between the temporal domain and the spectral domain in the spatial domain of electroencephalography (EEG) signals for different emotional states. To be specific, in the spatial-temporal domain, the activation degree of the temporal domain information directly reflects brain activity. The high degree of activation is usually related to positive emotion and the low degree of activation is often related to negative emotion. In the spatial-spectral domain, the activation degree of the 𝛾 band is often high in negative emotions and low in positive emotions  [35] . Considering these phenomena, most studies design various deep learning methods to extract spatial-temporal domain information or spatial-spectral domain information for emotion recognition. These methods can be mainly divided into two categories. One concentrates on the spatial-temporal domain  [6, 25, 40, 47] , and the other one concentrates on the spatial-spectral domain  [49, 51, 56, 57] . Specifically, the methods focusing on spatial-temporal domain information often only take the raw signals or other statistical features as the input of the network. The methods focusing on the spatialspectral domain often capture the correlation of the spectral domain features such as power spectral density (PSD) and differential entropy (DE) in the physiological signals. Though these two categories of methods achieve relatively satisfactory performance, they ignore complementarity among spatial-spectral-temporal domain information. SST-EmotionNet is proposed to extract the spatialspectral-temporal domain information in the image-like maps  [12] . However, areas of brain that are not covered by biosensors also produce bioelectrical signals. The voltage of these signals is usually not 0, so artificial zero-filling may introduce noise, as shown in Figure  2 (a). Besides, in Figure  2 (b), the graph-based method can reflect the topological relationship of the brain  [17, 48] . These shortcomings limit the performance of classification to a certain extent. Therefore, how to effectively extract spatial-spectral-temporal domain information is challenging work.   [23, 26] . However, most current methods only model the heterogeneity or correlation among different modalities separately. As for the heterogeneity, existing works use different feature extractors, such as CNN, to extract features of different modalities and capture the heterogeneity in multi-modal data  [27, 29, 34, 36] . However, these methods ignore the correlation among different modalities because the signals of different modalities are extracted separately. As for the correlation, existing works usually combine the signals of different modalities into a new data representation and feed it to a deep neural network to capture the correlation  [30, 38] , such as group sparse canonical correlation analysis (GSCCA)  [55] . However, these methods ignore the heterogeneity among different modalities because the features of all modalities are extracted by the same feature extractor. Therefore, how to model the heterogeneity and correlation among multi-modal signals simultaneously becomes a challenge.",

      "text": "In recent years, time series analysis has attracted the attention of many researchers  [13, 14] . As a typical time series, physiological signals are used in many fields, such as sleep staging  [4, 11, 15, 17, 18] , motor imagery  [16, 24, 61] , seizure detection  [31, 32] , and emotion recognition  [12, 41, 57] , etc. The physiological signals have been applied in emotion recognition widely because they can accurately reflect real emotions. Musha et al. use EEG signals to recognize emotions for the first time  [37] . In the early stage of research, researchers adopted traditional machine learning models like SVM to extract features of EEG signals to recognize emotions  [28] . However, those methods are often limited by prior knowledge. Deep learning methods  [33, 41, 44, 45, 57, 59 ] are proposed to make up for the shortcomings of traditional machine learning methods. They have shown outstanding results in natural language processing  [1]  and computer vision  [42]  as well as in affective computing.\n\nMulti-domain Features Extraction. In building deep learning models for emotion recognition, researchers often extract spatialtemporal domain features or spatial-spectral domain features to train models. For instance, for spatial-temporal domain features extraction, Zhang et al. propose a spatial-temporal recurrent neural network combining the spatial RNN layer and the temporal RNN layer to capture the spatial and temporal features, respectively  [54] .  Yang     [60] . Further, Jia et al. present SST-EmotionNet, extracting spatial features, spectral features, and temporal features simultaneously, and achieving higher performance for emotion recognition. However, image-like maps introduce noise into the network  [12] .\n\nMulti-modal Physiological Signals. Most methods model either heterogeneity  [29, 36]  or correlation  [38]     [30] .\n\nOverall, existing emotion recognition methods have achieved high accuracy. However, they still ignore the fusion of multi-domain features, multi-modal heterogeneity, and correlation. To solve the limitations, we propose HetEmotionNet, which models the complementarity among spatial-spectral-temporal domain features, the heterogeneity, and the correlation of the signals simultaneously.",

      "text": "For each sample, we construct a heterogeneous spatial-temporal graph sequence and a heterogeneous spatial-spectral graph sequence separately as shown in Figure  5 . These heterogeneous graph sequences are used to describe the spatial distribution of the temporal domain and spectral domain information of multi-modal signals.\n\nThe heterogeneous graph sequence is made up of several heterogeneous graphs. The general heterogeneous graph is usually defined as 𝐺 = (𝑋 𝐹 , 𝐴), where 𝑋 𝐹 denotes the graph node features, 𝐴 denotes the graph adjacency matrix which describes the relationship of channels. Besides, the node type depends on the modality of the channel.\n\nFigure  5  presents the process of constructing the heterogeneous graph sequence. Firstly, we build the relationship of the channels as 1\n\n○ in Figure  5 . Specifically, we calculate the correlation degree among different channels in the sample to determine the relationship of the channels using mutual information  [22] . Formally, given a channel pair (𝑢, 𝑣), their correlation 𝑎 𝑢,𝑣 can be formulated as follows:\n\nwhere 1 ≤ 𝑢 ≤ 𝑁 , 1 ≤ 𝑣 ≤ 𝑁 , 𝑋 𝑇 𝑢 represents the signals of channel 𝑢, 𝑋 𝑇 𝑣 represents the signals of channel 𝑣, 𝑇 is the number of timesteps, and 𝑁 is the number of channels. After calculating the correlation degree for all the channel pairs, we obtain the adjacency matrix 𝐴 = (𝑎 1,1 , . . . , 𝑎 𝑢,𝑣 , . . . , 𝑎 𝑁 ,𝑁 ) ∈ R 𝑁 ×𝑁 of the spatialtemporal graphs and the spatial-spectral graphs.\n\nTo construct the heterogeneous spatial-temporal graph sequence, we compute the temporal node features 𝑋 𝐹 𝑡 = (𝑋 𝐹 1 𝑡 , 𝑋 𝐹 2 𝑡 , . . . , 𝑋 𝐹 𝑁 𝑡 ) ∈ R 𝑁 , where 𝑋 𝐹𝑖 𝑡 denotes the amplitude (𝜇𝑉 ) on the 𝑖 𝑡ℎ channel in the 𝑡 𝑡ℎ timestep from the multi-modal signals, 1 ≤ 𝑡 ≤ 𝑇 . Then, we combine the temporal domain feature vector 𝑋 𝐹 𝑡 and the adjacency matrix 𝐴 to form a heterogeneous spatial-temporal graph 𝐺 𝑡 = (𝑋 𝐹 𝑡 , 𝐴) as 2 ○. Therefore, we obtain 𝑇 heterogeneous spatialtemporal graphs from the sample. These heterogeneous spatialtemporal graphs are stacked into a heterogeneous spatial-temporal graph sequence 𝐺 𝑇 = (𝐺 1 , 𝐺 2 , . . . , 𝐺 𝑇 -1 , 𝐺 𝑇 ) as 3 ○. To construct the heterogeneous spatial-spectral graph sequence, similar to the process of generating heterogeneous spatial-temporal graph sequence, we extract the DE features from the 𝐵 ∈ 𝑍 + frequency bands in the sample as 4\n\n○. These features extracted from different channels and the correlation among channels are converted to heterogeneous spatial-spectral graphs. Specifically, these feature vectors extracted from 𝑁 channels in the 𝑏 𝑡ℎ frequency band 𝑋 𝐹 𝑏 = (𝑋 𝐹 1 𝑏 , 𝑋 𝐹 2 𝑏 , . . . , 𝑋 𝐹 𝑁 𝑏 ) ∈ R 𝑁 and the adjacency matrix 𝐴 of the sample are composed of a heterogeneous spatial-spectral graph 𝐺 𝑏 = (𝑋 𝐹 𝑏 , 𝐴) as 5 ○. Therefore, we obtain 𝐵 heterogeneous spatial-spectral graphs in 𝐵 frequency bands for each sample. Then, these heterogeneous spatial-spectral graphs are stacked into a heterogeneous spatial-spectral sequence 𝐺 𝐵 = (𝐺 𝜃 , 𝐺 𝛼 , 𝐺 𝛽 , 𝐺 𝛾 ) as 6 ○.",

      "text": "HetEmotionNet consists of graph transformer network and graph recurrent neural network. Graph recurrent neural network is composed of graph convolutional network and gated recurrent unit. Graph Transformer Network. The Graph Transformer Network (GTN)  [52]  is used to model the heterogeneity of multi-modal signals by automatically extracting the meta-paths from the adjacency matrix set A. Specifically, A is generated from the heterogeneous adjacency matrix obtained in Section 4.1. The heterogeneous adjacency matrix is divided into homogeneous adjacency matrix set A = {A 1 , A 2 , . . . , A 𝑁 𝑎 } according to edge types, where A 𝑖 is homogeneous adjacency matrix, 1 ≤ 𝑖 ≤ 𝑁 𝑎 , and 𝑁 𝑎 is the number of adjacency matrices which is decided by the number of edge types.\n\nGTN consists of several GT-layers. Each GT-layer aims to learn a two-level meta-path, which represents the second-order neighbor relationship in the graph by learning two graph structures from A. GT-layer has two steps: the first step is designed to softly construct two graph structures, which are defined as:\n\nwhere 𝜙 denotes the 1 × 1 convolution, 𝑊 𝜙1 ∈ R 1×1×𝐾 and 𝑊 𝜙2 ∈ R 1×1×𝐾 are the parameters of 𝜙. 𝑄 1 and 𝑄 2 are the graph structures constructed by the 1 × 1 convolution. The second step is designed to generate meta-paths by matrix multiplication of 𝑄 1 and 𝑄 2 . Formally, 𝐻 (𝑙) = 𝑄 1 𝑄 2 , where 𝐻 (𝑙)  represents the meta-paths generated by 𝑙 𝑡ℎ GT-layer. For calculation stability, 𝐻 (𝑙) is updated as 𝐻 (𝑙) = 𝐷 -1 𝑄 1 𝑄 2 , where 𝐷 denotes the degree matrices of A.\n\nStacking several GT-layers in GTN aims to learn a high-level meta-path that is a useful relationship of multi-modal signals. The 𝑙 𝑡ℎ GT-layer in GTN updates the graph structure and multiplies the graph structure with the one constructed by (𝑙 -1) 𝑡ℎ GT-layer. Formally, 𝐻 (𝑙) = 𝑄 𝑙 𝐻 (𝑙-1) , where 𝑄 𝑙 denotes the graph structure learned by 𝑙 𝑡ℎ GT-layer, 𝐻 (𝑙) and 𝐻 (𝑙-1) represent the meta-paths learned by (𝑙 -1) 𝑡ℎ and 𝑙 𝑡ℎ GT-layers, respectively. To consider multiple relationship of multi-modal signals, which are decided by the number of meta-paths simultaneously, multi-channel 1 × 1 convolution is applied. The graph structure generated by multichannel 1 × 1 convolution is defined as:\n\nwhere Φ is the multi-channel 1 × 1 convolution, 𝑊 Φ ∈ R 1×𝐶 𝐴 ×𝐾 is learnable parameter, 𝐶 𝐴 is the number of channels, and 𝑄 ′ 𝑙 is the graph structure generated from 𝑙 𝑡ℎ GT-layer by this convolution. To concurrently learn various lengths of meta-paths, the identity matrix is added into the result of each GT-layer. Finally, the graph sequence is updated into 𝐶 𝐴 sequences according to the meta-paths learned from GTN.\n\nGraph Recurrent Neural Network. Graph recurrent neural network has two chief components, namely graph convolutional network and gated recurrent unit. These two components are used to extract both spatial domain and temporal/spectral domain features from graph sequences. Specifically, GCN is used to capture the spatial domain features by aggregating information from neighbor nodes. In addition, GRU is applied to extract temporal/spectral domain features from the graph sequence obtained after GCN.\n\nGraph Convolutional Network. GCN captures the correlation among the nodes in the graph. The correlation is valuable to recognize different emotions. For example, there exists much functional connectivity among different brain regions. Capturing the spatial domain relationship among these functional connectivity contributes to recognizing different emotions.\n\nTo capture the correlation, the spectral graph theory extends the convolution operation from image-like data to graph structure data  [3] . The graph structure is represented by its Laplacian matrix in the spectral graph analysis. The Laplacian matrix and its eigenvalues reflect the property of the graph. The Laplacian matrix is defined as 𝐿 = 𝐷 -𝐴, where 𝐿 ∈ R 𝑁 ×𝑁 is the Laplacian matrix, 𝐴 ∈ R 𝑁 ×𝑁 is the adjacency matrix, 𝐷 ∈ R 𝑁 ×𝑁 is the degree matrix of the graph, and 𝑁 is the vertex number. The eigenvalues matrix is obtained by decomposing the Laplacian matrix with 𝐿 = 𝑈 Λ𝑈 𝑇 , where 𝑈 is the Fourier basis and Λ ∈ R 𝑁 ×𝑁 is a diagonal matrix. The node feature is defined as 𝑥 𝑖 ∈ R 𝑁 for the graph 𝐺 𝑖 in graph sequence 𝐺 𝑠 . Then, the graph Fourier transform and inverse Fourier transform are defined as x𝑖 = 𝑈 𝑇 𝑥 𝑖 and 𝑥 𝑖 = 𝑈 x𝑖 , respectively. Because the graph convolution operation is equal to the product of these signals which have been transformed into the spectral domain  [3] , the graph convolution of signals 𝑥 𝑖 on graph 𝐺 𝑖 is defined as:\n\nwhere 𝑔 𝜃 denotes a graph convolution kernel and ★ 𝐺 𝑖 denotes a graph convolution operation on graph 𝐺 𝑖 . In addition, to simplify the calculation of Laplace matrix, the 𝐾 order Chebyshev Polynomials are adopted, which is defined as:\n\nwhere Λ = 2 𝜆 𝑚𝑎𝑥 Λ -𝐼 𝑁 , 𝐼 𝑁 is the identity matrix, and 𝜆 𝑚𝑎𝑥 is the maximum eigenvalues of Λ. The 𝜃 ∈ 𝑅 𝐾 is a vector of polynomial coefficients. The Chebyshev polynomials are defined as 𝑇 𝑘 (𝑥) = 2𝑥𝑇 𝑘-1 (𝑥) -𝑇 𝑘-2 (𝑥) recursively, where 𝑇 0 (𝑥) = 1 and 𝑇 1 (𝑥) = 𝑥.\n\nWith the 𝐾 order Chebyshev Polynomials, the message from 0 to 𝐾 𝑡ℎ neighbours are aggregated into the center node. For the fast calculation  [20] , the first-order polynomials are used and 𝜆 𝑚𝑎𝑥 = 2, 𝑘 = 1 are set. Then, the graph convolution is further simplified as:\n\nwhere 𝐷 is the degree matrix, 𝐴 is the adjacency matrix, and 𝜃 is the parameter. 𝐼 𝑁 + 𝐷 -1 2 𝐴𝐷 -1 2 is changed into D-1 2 Ã D-1 2 to prevent numerical instability, gradient explosion and gradient disappearance, where D = 𝑗 Ã𝑖 𝑗 and Ã = 𝐴 + 𝐼 𝑁 . The graph convolution of signals 𝑥 𝑖 on graph 𝐺 𝑖 in graph sequence is defined as:\n\nwhere 𝑥 𝑖 and 𝐻 𝐺𝐶𝑁 𝑖 are the node features before and after the graph convolution, respectively. 𝑊 is the weight vector, 𝜎 is the Rectified Linear Unit (ReLU) activation function, and 𝑏 is a bias.\n\nThe graph convolution operation is applied to the graph sequence. Formally, for graph sequence 𝐺 𝑠 = {𝐺 1 , 𝐺 2 , . . . , 𝐺 𝑛𝑠 } ∈ R 𝑁 ×𝑛𝑠 and each graph 𝐺 𝑖 in 𝐺 𝑠 , the graph convolution operation is applied on 𝐺 𝑖 . After the graph convolution operation is performed on all graphs in 𝐺 𝑠 , the results are stacked together to construct a new graph sequence 𝐻 𝑠 = {𝐻 1 , 𝐻 2 , . . . , 𝐻 𝑛𝑠 } ∈ R 𝑁 ×𝑛𝑠 . To decrease the number of parameters, all graph convolution operations share the same parameters.\n\nSince the meta-paths learned by GTN update the graph sequence obtained in Section 4.2 into 𝐶 𝐴 graph sequences, the graph convolution operation is performed on each of the graph sequences. Then, the weighted sum operation is adopted to concatenate the graph sequences together. The weighted sum operation on graph sequences 𝐺 𝐺𝑇 𝑁 𝑠 is defined as:\n\nwhere 𝛿 𝑠 denotes the graph convolution operation on the graph sequence, 𝑤 𝑖 is the weight for the weighted sum operation, and\n\nis the 𝑖 𝑡ℎ graph sequence in 𝐺 𝐺𝑇 𝑁 𝑠 . Gated Recurrent Unit. After the graph convolutional network, GRU is applied to capture the dependency among different timesteps or frequency bands. Gated recurrent unit consists of the reset gate and the update gate  [5] , which is defined as:\n\nwhere the parameters and the operator are defined as follows, ⊙ : the product of two matrices on each element.",

There are three kinds of ablation experiments: 1) Ablation experiments on the effectiveness of graph transformer network, graph convolutional network, and gated recurrent unit. 2) Ablation experiments on the effectiveness of fusing different modalities. 3) Ablation experiments on two-stream structure to verify whether utilizing spatial-spectral-temporal domain features simultaneously is useful.\n\nAblation on different components. To verify the effectiveness of different components in our model, we design three variants, which are described as follows:\n\n• HetEmotionNet-noGRU: To verify the effects of GRU on capturing temporal or spectral dependency, this variant removes GRU from HetEmotionNet.\n\n• HetEmotionNet-noGTN: To verify the effectiveness of GTN on modeling the heterogeneity of multi-modal data, this variant removes GTN from HetEmotionNet.\n\n• HetEmotionNet-noGCN: To verify the effectiveness of GCN on capturing the correlation, we remove GCN from HetEmotionNet.\n\nFigure  6  presents that removing different components from Het-EmotionNet reduces the performance. HetEmotionNet outperforms HetEmotionNet-noGTN, which indicates that GTN is effective to model the heterogeneity of multi-modal data. HetEmotionNet has a better performance than HetEmotionNet-noGCN, demonstrating that GCN is effective to capture the correlation among channels.

To verify the effects of using multi-modal data and modeling the heterogeneity of multi-modal data, we conduct ablation experiments and design three variants of HetEmotionNet:\n\n• HetEmotionNet-noEEG: It removes EEG signals from the multimodal data to verify the effects of only using PPS on the model's performance. In addition, we remove GTN from this variant because GTN is used to model the heterogeneity of multi-modal data while this variant only uses PPS.\n\n• HetEmotionNet-noPPS: It removes PPS from the multi-modal data to verify the influences of only using EEG signals on the model's performance. We remove the GTN for the same reason of HetEmotionNet-noEEG. However, it removes GTN to verify that modeling the heterogeneity of multi-modal data is important.\n\nAs Figure  7  illustrates, HetEmotionNet-noPPS performs better than HetEmotionNet-noEEG. This result indicates that the effects of only using EEG signals is better than only using PPS, because EEG signals are the main physiological signals used in emotion recognition  [53] . Besides, HetEmotionNet-noGTN outperforms HetEmotionNet-noPPS and HetEmotionNet-noEEG, which demonstrates that fusing data of different modalities further improves the performance. However, HetEmotionNet-noGTN does not model the heterogeneity of multi-modal data. Therefore, HetE-motionNet is designed to model the heterogeneity of multi-modal data and reaches the best results.\n\nAblation on two-stream structure. To verify the effectiveness of integrating two-stream, we design two variants as follows:\n\n• HetEmotionNet-noST (Spatial-Temporal stream): This variant removes the spatial-temporal stream to verify the effects of utilizing the spatial-temporal domain features of physiological signals.\n\n• HetEmotionNet-noSS (Spatial-Spectral stream): This variant removes the spatial-spectral stream to verify the effects of using the spatial-spectral domain features of physiological signals.\n\nAs Figure  8  illustrates, HetEmotionNet-noSS performs better than HetEmotionNet-noST, which demonstrates that extracting features in spatial and temporal domain is more effective than extracting features in spatial and spectral domain. Besides, HetEmotionNet has a better performance than two variants, which manifests that our model is able to fuse the spatial-spectral-temporal domain features simultaneously and improve the classification accuracy.",

      "text": "In this paper, we propose a novel two-stream heterogeneous graph recurrent neural network using multi-modal physiological signals for emotion recognition. The proposed HetEmotionNet is based on the two-stream structure, which can extract spatial-spectraltemporal domain features from multi-modal signals simultaneously. Moreover, each stream consists of GTN for modeling the heterogeneity, GCN for modeling the correlation, and GRU for capturing the temporal domain or spectral domain dependency. Experiments on the DEAP and the MAHNOB-HCI datasets indicate that our proposed model achieves state-of-the-art performance on DEAP and MAHNOB-HCI. Besides, the proposed model is a general framework for multi-modal physiological signals.",
