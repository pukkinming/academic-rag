      "text": "It is often difficult to correctly infer a writer's emotion from text exchanged online, and differences in recognition between writers and readers can be problematic. In this paper, we propose a new framework for detecting sentences that create differences in emotion recognition between the writer and the reader and for detecting the kinds of expressions that cause such differences. The proposed framework consists of a bidirectional encoder representations from transformers (BERT)-based detector that detects sentences causing differences in emotion recognition and an analysis that acquires expressions that characteristically appear in such sentences. The detector, based on a Japanese SNS-document dataset with emotion labels annotated by both the writer and three readers of the social networking service (SNS) documents, detected \"hidden-anger sentences\" with AUC = 0.772; these sentences gave rise to differences in the recognition of anger. Because SNS documents contain many sentences whose meaning is extremely difficult to interpret, by analyzing the sentences detected by this detector, we obtained several expressions that appear characteristically in hidden-anger sentences. The detected sentences and expressions do not convey anger explicitly, and it is difficult to infer the writer's anger, but if the implicit anger is pointed out, it becomes possible to guess why the writer is angry. Put into practical use, this framework would likely have the ability to mitigate problems based on misunderstandings. \n CCS CONCEPTS • Information systems → Sentiment analysis.",

      "text": "With the increase in online communication, especially through social networking service (SNS), discrepancies between writers' and readers' perceptions of texts have become an issue  [22] . Sentiment analysis  [11]  is one practical solution to this problem. In recent years, researchers have proposed several methods based on machine learning (ML) for classifying the polarity of sentiment (i.e., positive or negative)  [17]  or for estimating sentiment in terms of type and intensity  [2] . As types of emotion, Ekman's six emotions (joy, sadness, surprise, anger, fear, and disgust)  [6]  and Plutchik's eight emotions (joy, sadness, anticipation, surprise, anger, fear, disgust, and trust)  [16]  have been widely used in research. Emotion estimation from sentences has been implemented in various applications, including an emotion-aware dialogue system  [8]  and opinion extraction  [7] . A support system based on such emotion estimation techniques that presents possible differences in perception between writers and readers is expected to mitigate problems in online communication.\n\nFor document data, including publicly available datasets, most of the gold-standard labels used in conventional studies have been assigned by third-party readers  [1, [12] [13] [14] 18] . Therefore, in sentiment analysis, differences in sentiment perceptions between writers and readers cannot be ignored, and the validity of labels is questionable. Recently, studies have reported quantitative clues about the emotional differences between writers and readers of documents  [3] .\n\nKajiwara et al.  [9]  published WRIME, a Japanese SNS-document dataset that includes eight emotional label information by both the writer and three readers in each data. They quantitatively compared the emotional intensity of writers and readers and concluded the readers tended to underestimate the writers' emotions, especially anger and trust. However, they discussed only directly observable differences and did not offer an analysis of more implicit phenomena, such as the causes of underestimation. We maintain that to estimate the emotions in question more accurately, it is important to identify expressions that cause differences in emotion recognition between writers and readers.\n\nIn this study, we propose a new framework using bidirectional encoder representations from transformers (BERT)  [5]  to predict sentences that will cause substantial differences in emotion recognition between writers and readers, and we identified the expressions that may be responsible for these differences. Our preliminary analysis of this dataset showed that of the eight emotions, anger was the most strongly differentiated in emotion recognition; this paper therefore focuses on this emotion. To the best of the authors' knowledge, this study is the first attempt to quantitatively analyze clues about differences in emotion recognition between writers and readers of texts used in network communication. Our model is able to detect sentences that obscured the writer's anger, that is, sentences from which the reader did not infer the writer's anger. The expressions this study identifies as hidden-anger expressions can be difficult to notice as such, because they lack an explicitly angry meaning. However, many of them make sense when the anger is pointed out. Although an angry writer may use such expressions unconsciously, it is important to examine them.",

      "text": "In recent years, pretrained language models such as BERT  [5]  have achieved high performance in sentiment analysis by constructing contextualized representation. As the performance of emotion estimation has improved, attempts have been made to extract wordlevel or clause-level causes of emotions in text. Lee et al. and Xia et al. presented the task of emotion cause extraction  [4]  and emotioncause pair extraction  [21] , respectively, both using corpus annotated emotions and corresponding causes.\n\nThese studies have improved the performance of emotion recognition methods. However, as Wilson et al. and Parrott pointed out, a single text may contain multiple opinions and emotions  [20] , and human emotions are complex  [15] , so the writer and reader of a text can exhibit differences in emotion recognition. Tang and Chen  [19]  attempted to model these differences using a classifier, but the dataset they used lacks labels applied by the writers themselves. In this paper, we attempt to detect expressions that may cause these differences from sentences annotated by both writers and readers.",

A total of 43,200 sentences posted on SNS were annotated using four levels of intensity (0-3) of eight different emotions  [16]  by the writers (posters) and by three thirdparty readers.\n\nFigure  1  shows co-occurrence matrices of emotional labels with intensity of two or more in four levels (0-3) by writers and readers. The reader's emotional intensity is the average of the emotional labels applied by the three readers. The matrices show that although writers tend to have multiple emotions, readers tend to perceive only a single emotion. The matrices also indicate that readers tend to underestimate writers' emotions. This is especially true for the emotions of anger and trust. Although the writers applied 3,040 and 5,167 strong anger and trust labels, the readers applied only 543 and 185, respectively.",

      "text": "Based on our analysis of the dataset, we propose a new framework that predicts sentences with substantial differences in emotion recognition and identifies the kinds of expressions that trigger such differences. This paper focuses on the emotion of anger for the reason outlined above. We define sentences in which the writer's anger intensity exceeded the reader's perceived intensity by two or more of the four levels (0-3) as hidden-anger sentences, in which it is difficult for third parties to estimate the writer's anger. It was possible that the reader's intensity may exceed the writer's, but   since it was virtually absent from the current dataset, we did not consider it in this paper.\n\nHere, SNS documents contain not a few of the sentences shown in Table  1 , in which it is nearly impossible for models or humans to estimate emotions and sometimes even to understand basic meaning. In the investigation of what expressions of hidden-anger are being brought about, such sentences are noise and inhibit accurate analysis. Therefore, our proposed framework consists of two stages; (i) prediction of hidden-anger sentences and, (ii) detection of hidden-anger expressions. In the first stage, a BERT-based detector is constructed to detect hidden-anger sentences; in the subsequent stage, hidden-anger expressions are detected by analyzing only those sentences the detector has correctly predicted.",

We randomly split the dataset into 4:1 for training and evaluation and performed binary classification to detect hidden-anger sentences. We used cross-entropy as a loss function, a batch size of 32, a dropout rate of 0.1, a learning rate of 2e-5, and Adam  [10]  for optimization. We stopped the training after three epochs.",

Anger Writer: 2 Reader1: 0 Reader2: 0 Reader3: 0 the three readers in the anger-intensity labels. A larger this value indicates a greater difference between the writer's and readers' perceptions of anger. The values for sentences containing each detected word are greater than 0.182, the value for all sentences in the dataset. Although this result alone does not determine that the selected words are responsible for hidden-anger expressions, it does confirm that the detected words have an impact on the perception of anger.\n\nTable  3  presents examples of sentences containing the detected words and the anger-intensities annotated in each sentence. Because these sentences do not involve explicit expressions of anger, it is difficult for readers to estimate the writer's anger, as the labels applied by the three readers make evident. However, a careful reading of each sentence, with an awareness of the possibility of hidden-anger due to the proposed method, reveals why the writer may have been angry. In the sentences shown in Table  1 , that is extremely difficult. By removing such sentences using the BERTbased detector and then analyzing them, we can detect hiddenanger expressions that humans can interpret accurately through context-aware analysis.\n\nAlthough it is difficult to rigorously evaluate the validity of the detected hidden-anger expressions, the quantitative evaluation performed in this experiment suggests that the set of words detected by the proposed framework is valid as expressions that trigger differences in the perception of anger in SNS documents.",
