      "text": "Emotion recognition is a crucial task for human conversation understanding. It becomes more challenging with the notion of multimodal data, e.g., language, voice, and facial expressions. As a typical solution, the globaland the local context information are exploited to predict the emotional label for every single sentence, i.e., utterance, in the dialogue. Specifically, the global representation could be captured via modeling of cross-modal interactions at the conversation level. The local one is often inferred using the temporal information of speakers or emotional shifts, which neglects vital factors at the utterance level. Additionally, most existing approaches take fused features of multiple modalities in an unified input without leveraging modalityspecific representations. Motivating from these problems, we propose the Relational Temporal Graph Neural Network with Auxiliary Cross-Modality Interaction (CORECT), an novel neural network framework that effectively captures conversation-level cross-modality interactions and utterance-level temporal dependencies with the modality-specific manner for conversation understanding. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of CORECT via its stateof-the-art results on the IEMOCAP and CMU-MOSEI datasets for the multimodal ERC task 1 .",

      "text": "Oh my gosh.\n\nJust a couple days ago.\n\nOh my gosh. adds complexity to the task of Emotion Recognition in Conversations (ERC)  (Wang et al., 2022) .\n\nMultimodal ERC, which aims to automatically detect the a speaker's emotional state during a conversation using information from text content, facial expressions, and audio signals, has garnered significant attention and research in recent years and has been applied to many real-world scenarios  (Sharma and Dhall, 2021; Joshi et al., 2022) .\n\nMassive methods have been developed to model conversation's context. These approaches can be categorized into two main groups: graph-based methods  (Ghosal et al., 2019; Zhang et al., 2019; Shen et al., 2021b)  and recurrence-based methods  (Hazarika et al., 2018a; Ghosal et al., 2020; Majumder et al., 2019; Hu et al., 2021) . In addition, there have been advancements in multimodal models that leverage the dependencies and complementarities of multiple modalities to improve the ERC performance  (Poria et al., 2017; Hazarika et al., 2018b; Zadeh et al., 2018) . One limitation of these methods is their heavy reliance on nearby utterances when updating the state of the query utterance, which can restrict their overall performance. Recently, Graph Neural Network (GNN)-based methods have been proposed for the multimodal ERC task due to their ability to capture long-distance contextual information through their relational modeling capabilities. However, those models rely on fused inputs being treated as a single node in the graph  (Ghosal et al., 2019; Joshi et al., 2022) , which limits their ability to capture modality-specific representations and ultimately hampers their overall performance.\n\nThe temporal aspect of conversations is crucial, as past and future utterances can significantly influence the query utterance as Figure  1 . The sentence \"I know me neither\" appears with opposing labels on different dialogues, which could be caused by sequential effects from previous or future steps. There are only a few methods that take into account the temporal aspect of conversations. MMGCN  (Wei et al., 2019)  represents modality-specific features as graph nodes but overlooks the temporal factor. DAG-ERC  (Shen et al., 2021b)  incorporates temporal information, but focuses solely on text modality. Recently, COGMEN  (Joshi et al., 2022)  proposes to learn contextual, inter-speaker, and intra-speaker relations, but neglects modalityspecific features and partially utilizes cross-modal information by fusing all modalities' representations at the input stage.\n\nThe aforementioned limitations motivate us to propose a COnversation understanding model using RElational Temporal Graph Neural Network with Auxiliary Cross-Modality Interaction (CORECT). It comprises two key components: the (i) Relational Temporal Graph Convolutional Network (RT-GCN); and the (ii) Pairwise Crossmodal Feature Interaction (P-CM). The RT-GCN module is based on RGCNs  (Schlichtkrull et al., 2018)  and GraphTransformer  (Yun et al., 2019)  while the P-CM is built upon  (Tsai et al., 2019) . Overall, our main contributions are as follows:\n\n• We propose the CORECT framework for Multimodal ERC, which concurrently exploit the utterance-level local context feature from multimodal interactions with temporal dependencies via RT-GCN, and the cross-modal global context feature at the conversation level by P-CM. These features are aggregated to enhance the performance of the utterance-level emotional recognition.\n\n• We conduct extensive experiments to show that CORECT consistently outperforms the previous SOTA baselines on the two publicly real-life datasets, including IEMOCAP and CMU-MOSEI, for the multimodal ERC task.\n\n• We conduct ablation studies to investigate the effect of various components and modalities on CORECT for conversation understanding.",

      "text": "The complexity of conversations, with multiple speakers, dynamic interactions, and contextual dependencies, presents challenges for the ERC task.\n\nThere are efforts to model the conversation context in ERC, with a primary focus on the textual modality. Several notable approaches include CMN  (Hazarika et al., 2018b) , DialogueGCN  (Ghosal et al., 2019) , COSMIC  (Ghosal et al., 2020) , Dia-logueXL  (Shen et al., 2021a) , DialogueCRN  (Hu et al., 2021) , DAG-ERC  (Shen et al., 2021b) .\n\nMultimodal machine learning has gained popularity due to its ability to address the limitations of unimodal approaches in capturing complex realworld phenomena  (Baltrušaitis et al., 2018) . It is recognized that human perception and understanding are influenced by the integration of multiple sensory inputs. There have been several notable approaches that aim to harness the power of multiple modalities in various applications  (Poria et al., 2017; Zadeh et al., 2018; Majumder et al., 2019) , etc. CMN  (Hazarika et al., 2018b)  combines features from different modalities by concatenating them directly and utilizes the Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) to model contextual information. ICON  (Hazarika et al., 2018a ) extracts multimodal conversation features and employs global memories to model emotional influences hierarchically, resulting in improved performance for utterance-video emotion recognition. ConGCN  (Zhang et al., 2019)  models utterances and speakers as nodes in a graph, capturing context dependencies and speaker dependencies as edges. However, ConGCN focuses only on textual and acoustic features and does not consider other modalities. MMGCN  (Wei et al., 2019) , on the other hand, is a graph convolutional network (GCN)-based model that effectively captures both long-distance contextual information and multimodal interactive information.\n\nMore recently,  Lian et al. (2022)  propose a novel framework that combines semi-supervised learning with multimodal interactions. However, it currently addresses only two modalities, i.e., text and audio, with visual information reserved for future work.  Shi and Huang (2023)  introduces MultiEMO, an attention-based multimodal fusion framework that effectively integrates information from textual, audio and visual modalities. However, neither of these models addresses the temporal aspect in conversations.",

      "text": "In the past few years, there has been a growing interest in representing non-Euclidean data as graphs. However, the complexity of graph data has presented challenges for traditional neural network models. From initial research on graph neural networks (GNNs)  (Gori et al., 2005; Scarselli et al., 2008) , generalizing the operations of deep neural networks were paid attention, such as convolution  (Kipf and Welling, 2017) , recurrence  (Nicolicioiu et al., 2019) , and attention  (Velickovic et al., 2018) , to graph structures. When faced with intricate interdependencies between modalities, GNN is a more efficient approach to exploit the potential of multimodal datasets. The strength of GNNs lies in its ability to capture and model intra-modal and intermodal interactions. This flexibility makes them an appealing choice for multimodal learning tasks.\n\nThere have been extensive studies using the capability of GNNs to model the conversations. Di-alogueGCN  (Ghosal et al., 2019 ) models conversation using a directed graph with utterances as nodes and dependencies as edges, fitting it into a GCN structure. MMGCN  (Wei et al., 2019)  adopts an undirected graph to effectively fuse multimodal information and capture long-distance contextual and inter-modal interactions.  Lian et al. (2020)  proposed a GNN-based architecture for ERC that utilizes both text and speech modalities. Dialogue-CRN  (Hu et al., 2021)  incorporates multiturn reasoning modules to extract and integrate emotional clues, enabling a comprehensive understanding of the conversational context from a cognitive perspective. MTAG  (Yang et al., 2021)  is capable of both fusion and alignment of asynchronously distributed multimodal sequential data. COGMEN  (Joshi et al., 2022)  uses GNN-based architecture to model complex dependencies, including local and global information in a conversation.  Chen et al. (2023)  presents Multivariate Multi-frequency Multimodal Graph Neural Network, M 3 Net for short, to explore the relationships between modalities and context. However, it primarily focuses on modalitylevel interactions and does not consider the temporal aspect within the graph.",

Figure  3  provides an illustrative example of the relations represented on the constructed graph.\n\nNodes. Each utterance u i generates three nodes u a i , u v i , and u l i , which x a i , x v i , and x l i are the respective audio, visual, and lexical feature vectors.\n\nEdges. The edge (u τ i , u τ j , r ij ) ∈ E, τ ∈ {a, v, l} represents the interaction between u τ i and u τ j with the relation type r ij ∈ R. In the scope of paper, we consider two groups of relations: R multi and R temp . Specifically, R multi represents the intra connections between the three modalities within the same utterance, reflecting multimodal interactions. On the other hand, R temp captures the inter connections between utterances of the same modality within a specified time window. This temporal relationship includes past/previous utterances de-noted as P and next/future utterances denoted as F. As a result, there are 15 edge types created with the definitions of the two groups.\n\nMultimodal Relation. Emotions in dialogues cannot be solely conveyed through lexical, acoustic, or visual modalities in isolation. The interactions between utterances across different modalities play a crucial role. For example, given an utterance in a graph, its visual node has different interactive magnitude with acoustic-and textual nodes. Additionally, each node has a self-aware connection to reinforce its own information. Therefore, we can formalize 9 edge types of R multi to capture the multimodal interactions within the dialogue as:\n\nTemporal Relation. It is vital to have distinct treatment for interactions between nodes that occur in different temporal orders  (Poria et al., 2017) . To capture this temporal aspect, we set a window slide [P, F] to control the number of past/previous and next/future utterances that are set has connection to current node u τ i . This window enables us to define the temporal context for each node and capture the relevant information from the dynamic surrounding utterances. Therefore, we have 6 edge types of R temp as follows:\n\nwhere τ ∈ {a, v, l}; i, j ∈ 1, N ; future ← and past → indicate the past and future relation respectively.",

For each relation type r ∈ R, node representation is inferred via a mapping function f (H, W r ), where W r is the weighted matrix. Aggregating all 15 edge types, the final node representation could be computed by R r f (H, W r ). To be more specific, the representation for the i-th utterance is inferred as follows: where N r (i) is the set of the node i's neighbors with the relation r ∈ R, W 0 , W r ∈ R d h1 ×dτ are learnable parameters (h1 is the dimension of the hidden layer used by R-GCN), and x τ i ∈ R dτ ×1 denotes the feature vector of node u τ i ; τ ∈ {a, v, l}. To extract rich representations from node features, we utilize a Graph Transformer model  (Yun et al., 2019) , where each layer comprises a selfattention mechanism followed by feed-forward neural networks. The self-attention mechanism allows vertices to exploit information from neighborhoods as well as capturing local and global patterns in the graph.

The model performance on the 6-way IEMOCAP dataset is remarkably degraded when the RT-GCN or P-CM module is not adopted with the decrease by 3.47% and 3.38% respectively. Similar phenomena is observed on the 4-way IEMOCAP dataset. Therefore, we can deduce that the effect of RT-GCN in the CORECT model is more significant than that of P-CM.\n\nFor different relation types, ablating either R multi or R temp results in a significant decrease in the performance. However, the number of labels may affect on the multimodal graph construction, thus it is no easy to distinguish the importance of R multi and R temp for the multimodal ERC task.\n\nTable  8  (Appendix A.2) presents the ablation results for uni-and bi-modal combinations. In the unimodal settings, specifically for each individual modality (A, V, T), it's important to highlight that both P-CM module and multimodal relations R multi are non-existent. However, in bimodal combinations, the advantage of leveraging cross-modality information between audio and text (A+T) stands out, with a significant performance boost of over 2.75% compared to text and visual (T+V) modalities and a substantial 14.54% compared to visual and audio (V+A) modalities.\n\nAdditionally, our experiments have shown a slight drop in overall model performance (e.g., 68.32% in IEMOCAP 6-way, drop of 1.70%) when excluding Speaker Embedding S emb from CORECT.\n\nEffect of the Past and Future Utterance Nodes. We conduct an analysis to investigate the influence of past nodes (P) and future nodes (F) on the model's performance. Unlike previous studies   The red-dash line implies our best setting for P and F.  (Joshi et al., 2022; Li et al., 2023)  that treated P and F pairs equally, we explore various combinations of P and F settings to determine their effects. Figure  4  indicates that the number of past or future nodes can have different impacts on the performance. From the empirical analysis, the setting [P, F] of  [11, 9]  results in the best performance. This finding shows that the contextual information from the past has a stronger influence on the multimodal ERC task compared to the future context. For IEMOCAP (Table  2  and Table 3 ), the textual modality performs the best among the unimodal settings, while the visual modality yields the lowest results. This can be attributed to the presence of noise caused by factors, e.g., camera position, environmental conditions. In the bi-modal settings, combining the textual and acoustic modalities achieves the best performance, while combin-ing the visual and acoustic modalities produces the worst result. A similar trend is observed in the CMU-MOSEI dataset (Table  4 ), where fusing all modalities together leads to a better result compared to using individual or paired modalities.",

      "text": "In this work, we propose CORECT, an novel network architecture for multimodal ERC. It consists of two main components including RT-GCN and P-CM. The former helps to learn local-context representations by leveraging modality-level topological relations while the latter supports to infer cross-modal global-context representations from the entire dialogue. Extensive experiments on two popular benchmark datasets, i.e., IEMOCAP and CMU-MOSEI, demonstrate the effectiveness of CORECT, which achieves the new state-of-theart record for multimodal conversational emotion recognition. Furthermore, we also provide ablation studies to investigate the contribution of various components in CORECT. Interestingly, by analyzing the temporal aspect of conversations, we have validated that capturing the long-term dependencies, e.g., past relation, improves the performance of the multimodal emotion recognition in conversations task.",

      "section_name": "Limitations",
      "text": "Hyper-parameter tuning is a vital part of optimizing machine learning models. Not an exception, the learning of CORECT is affected by hyperparameters such as the number of attention head in P-CM module, the size of Future and Past Window. Due to time constraints and limited computational resources, it was not possible to tune or exploring all possible combinations of these hyperparameters, which might lead to local-minima convergences. In future, one solution for this limitation is to employ automated hyper-parameter optimization algorithms, to systematically explore the hyperparameter space and improve the robustness of the model. As another solution, we may upgrade CORECT with learning mechanisms to automatically leverage important information, e.g., attention mechanism on future and past utterances.",
