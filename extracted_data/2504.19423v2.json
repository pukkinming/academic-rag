      "text": "Emotion plays a pivotal role in human-computer interactions  [24, 33] , drawing increasing attention within the field of artificial intelligence. Already today, humans interact more frequently with AI systems than through direct human-to-human interaction, and this trend is expected to grow even more pronounced in the coming years. Emotion-aware interaction systems hold significant potential across various domains, including healthcare, banking, transportation, and education  [7, 8] .\n\nHuman emotion expression is a complex process that typically involves multiple modalities, including facial expressions, vocal tones, body movements, gestures, and even physiological signals  [12] . This complexity has spurred the development of Multimodal Emotion Recognition (MER), a critical task that aims to integrate cross-modal cues to identify human emotions. Recently, MER research has evolved in two key directions: a) from coarse-grained  [18]  to fine-grained emotion recognition  [16] , and b) from categorical approaches  [14]  to descriptive emotion understanding  [4, 13] , aiming to enhance both prediction accuracy and interpretability. In line with these advancements, MER2025@ACM Multimedia introduces four tracks aligned with current research priorities:\n\nTrack 1. MER-SEMI. Recent studies have demonstrated that pre-training on large-scale unlabeled data  [22] , especially domainmatched data, can significantly enhance model performance  [5, 18, 29] . This track provides a substantial collection of unlabeled samples from the same domain as the labeled data. Participants are encouraged to leverage semi-supervised learning techniques, such as masked auto-encoders  [30]  or contrastive learning  [26] , to achieve better results.\n\nTrack 2. MER-FG. Current frameworks primarily focus on basic emotions, often failing to capture the complexity and subtlety of human emotions. This track shifts the emphasis to fine-grained MER, enabling the prediction of a broader range of emotions. Following previous works  [13, 16] , participants are encouraged to leverage large language models (LLMs) for this purpose. Given that LLMs possess extensive vocabularies, they hold the potential to generate more diverse emotion categories beyond basic labels.\n\nTrack 3. MER-DES. The first two tracks primarily focus on emotion words, neglecting the integration of multimodal clues during the inference process. This omission results in prediction outcomes that lack interpretability. Moreover, emotion words struggle to fully capture the dynamic, diverse, and sometimes ambiguous nature of human emotions. This track seeks to leverage free-form, natural language descriptions to represent emotions  [13, 19] , offering greater flexibility to achieve more accurate emotion representations and enhance model interpretability.\n\nSubtitle: Why are you all looking at me like that? So, as long as it's a woman, does she have to have a relationship with me?\n\nTask: select the most likely label from six categories: worried, happy, neutral, angry, surprise, and sad Label: surprise",

At the beginning of the video, his eyes are wide open and his mouth is also open, indicating a surprised facial expression. In the following scenes, he looks around, seemingly explaining or narrating something to the people around him. Overall, his emotions are not positive or optimistic. In the audio, the character speaks with a stutter, which usually expresses feelings of nervousness, anxiety, or unease. Combined with the text content, the character seems to be unhappy and angry due to the prejudice of the people around him. The subtitle in the text says, \"Why are you all looking at me like that? So, as long as it's a woman, does she have to have a relationship with me?\" This sentence expresses the male character's dissatisfaction and anger towards the people around him. Based on the surprised and negative facial expression of the male character in the video clues, as well as the stuttering speech in the audio clues, we can infer that the male character is expressing a feeling of dissatisfaction and anger in this sentence. He may feel troubled by the prejudice of the people around him and is unhappy with this unfair treatment.",

This year, we expanded the dataset by incorporating more labeled and unlabeled samples. Our raw data comes from two sources: a) conversational emotion datasets MC-EIU  [20]  and M3ED  [31] , with explicit approval from dataset owners; and b) 19 Chinese TV series sourced from publicly available platforms. Then, we follow the video segmentation and filtering process used in prior MER challenges  [15, 17] , ensuring each video contains predominantly one speaker with relatively complete speech content. Compared   1 .\n\nFor evaluation purposes, manually annotating 124k unlabeled data is impractical due to the substantial time and financial costs. Thus, we select a subset of the unlabeled data for performance assessments. To ensure label reliability, we recruit nine annotators and conduct a preliminary test to evaluate their alignment with emotion experts. In this process, two annotators are excluded based on insufficient agreement, leaving seven annotators for the labeling task. Then, we randomly sample 10k instances from the unlabeled subset and ask the annotators to choose the most likely label from eight categories: neutral, happy, angry, sad, surprise, worry, others, unknown. In this process, each annotator is assigned a portion of the 10k samples to reduce annotation time. Meanwhile, we ensure that each sample is labeled by at least five annotators. Samples that receive at least 80% agreements and whose majority vote is neither others nor unknown are included in the test set. This process yields 2,026 high-quality test samples, ensuring strong inter-annotator agreement and reliable ranking results.",

      "text": "Unlike MER-SEMI, which restricts the prediction scope to six candidates, MER-FG does not limit the label space, allowing predictions for any number and any emotion categories for each sample. In this track, we utilize two recently released datasets, OV-MERD  [16]  and MER-Caption+  [13] , as training datasets. Their statistics are summarized in Table  3 . Specifically, OV-MERD employs a humanled, model-assisted annotation strategy, where MLLMs first provide pre-extracted multimodal clues and then rely heavily on manual verification to ensure label quality. In contrast, MER-Caption+ adopts a human-assisted, model-led annotation strategy, leveraging human priors to guide description generation and sample filtering, ultimately achieving an automatic annotation process. Consequently, OV-MERD provides small-scale but high-quality labels, whereas MER-Caption+ offers large-scale labels that may contain some errors in emotion annotations. Figure  2  summarizes the sample-wise label number distribution of these datasets. We observe that they provide rich emotion labels for each sample, offering potential for complex emotion modeling.\n\nFor evaluation purposes, we randomly selected 1,200 samples from the unlabeled set in MER-SEMI and engaged four annotators to label them. These annotators were distinct from those involved in the MER-SEMI dataset and had also successfully passed the preliminary qualification test described in MER-SEMI. Figure  3  presents the detailed annotation pipeline. Specifically, we first aggregated the Top-6 teams' submission results from the previous year's MER-OV track to generate initial labels. Each annotator was then tasked with either selecting labels they deemed correct or adding any additional labels they considered appropriate but not included in the provided candidate list. This approach enabled us to obtain richer emotion annotations for each sample compared to directly asking annotators to provide labels without candidate options. Our manual verification process consisted of two rounds. In the first round, we preserved all labels selected by different annotators to ensure comprehensiveness. In the second round, we retained only those labels confirmed by at least two annotators to ensure accuracy. Through this two-step verification process, each final label was validated at least three times, ensuring both comprehensiveness and accuracy of the annotation results.",

      "text": "This track does not restrict the number or category of labels during prediction. Therefore, traditional metrics like accuracy are not suitable for MER-FG. For evaluation purposes, we follow the previous work  [16]  and compute results in two stages.\n\n3.2.1 Grouping. First, we apply a three-level grouping strategy to reduce the impact of synonyms:\n\nM1. We normalize different forms of emotion words to their base form. For example, we map happier and happiness to happy. This function is denoted as 𝐹 (•).\n\nM2. We map synonyms to a unified label. For example, we map happy and joyful to happy. We call this function 𝐺 (•).\n\nM3. The emotion wheel provides natural hierarchical grouping, with basic emotions located in the innermost layer and more nuanced labels arranged in the outer layers  [25] . Figure  4  shows two emotion wheels. First, we group the labels by their levels from the innermost to the outermost as 𝐿 1  𝑤 , 𝐿 2 𝑤 , and 𝐿 3 𝑤 . Next, we define a mapping function 𝑚 𝑖→𝑗 𝑤 (•) that transforms labels from level 𝐿 𝑖 𝑤 to their corresponding labels in level 𝐿 𝑗 𝑤 . We then introduce two grouping functions, 𝑊 1 and 𝑊 2 . For 𝑊 1 , all labels are mapped to their corresponding labels in 𝐿 1 𝑤 :\n\nFor 𝑊 2 , all labels are mapped to corresponding labels in 𝐿 2 𝑤 :\n\nThe above grouping functions can be summarized as:\n\nIn this paper, we employ five emotion wheels {𝑤 𝑖 } 5 𝑖=1 , following the approach of previous works  [16] . This process mitigates the influence of the choice of emotion wheels, thereby yielding more reliable evaluation results. Consequently, the aforementioned grouping function is dependent on the specific emotion wheel used. Therefore, we denote the final grouping functions as 𝐿 1  𝑤 𝑖 (•) and 𝐿 2\n\n𝑤 𝑖 (•), where the former focuses on coarse-grained grouping, while the latter emphasizes more fine-grained grouping.",

In this paper, we define the following scores 𝑆 1 and 𝑆 2 based on different grouping functions, and use their average results for the final ranking:\n\n3.3 Baseline Framework 3.3.1 Zero-shot Baselines. The primary objective of MER-FG is to generate appropriate emotion labels for a given sample without being constrained by a predefined emotion taxonomy. Consequently, LLM-driven baselines are well-suited for this task, as they have extensive vocabularies that enable the generation of finegrained emotion labels. Given that emotions are often expressed through multimodal cues, we primarily select multimodal LLMs (MLLMs) as our baselines, including representative frameworks such as SALMONN and Chat-UniVi. To extract emotion-related clues, we employ the following prompt: As an expert in the field of emotions, please focus on the facial expressions, body movements, environment, acoustic information, subtitle content, etc., in the video to discern clues related to the emotions of the individual. Please provide a detailed description and ultimately predict the emotional state of the individual in the video.\n\nNext, we use Qwen2.5 to extract emotion labels from the above descriptions using the following prompt: Please assume the role of an expert in the field of emotions. We provide clues that may be related to the emotions of the characters. Based on the provided clues, please identify the emotional states of the main characters. Please separate different emotional categories with commas and output only the clearly identifiable emotional categories in a list format. If none are identified, please output an empty list.\n\nFinally, we obtain the emotion prediction results for MER-FG. This process does not involve any training and operates in a zeroshot setup. For MLLMs, we use their 7B parameter weights by default. All models are implemented in PyTorch, and all inference processes are conducted on an A100 GPU. Additionally, we leverage the vLLM toolkit to accelerate the inference process.",

The evaluation will be conducted along two dimensions: First, we will evaluate whether the submission results include interpretable clues. This criterion distinguishes MER-DES from MER-SEMI and MER-FG by ensuring that participants do not merely provide emotion labels without supporting evidence.\n\nSecond, we will assess the quality of the emotion descriptions from two perspectives: 1) whether the provided emotion clues are present in the video; and 2) whether the emotion and its associated clues are logically connected.\n\nInitially, we plan to provide real descriptions and calculate similarity scores between real and predicted descriptions, as done in EMER  [19] . However, human emotional expression is complex and difficult to fully capture all emotion-related visual and acoustic cues. Therefore, we shift our focus to manual evaluation. During the ranking process, each team is required to participate in the labeling process. We will exclude annotators with low inter-annotator agreement compared to others to ensure annotation quality. Additionally, we will mask the sample names and require participants to submit results in English while using their translated Chinese versions for ranking.
