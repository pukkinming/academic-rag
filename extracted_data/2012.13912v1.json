In this paper, we describe our approaches in EmotiW 2019, which mainly explores emotion features and feature fusion strategies for audio and visual modality. For emotion features, we explore audio feature with both speech-spectrogram and Log Mel-spectrogram and evaluate several facial features with different CNN models and different emotion pretrained strategies. For fusion strategies, we explore intra-modal and cross-modal fusion methods, such as designing attention mechanisms to highlights important emotion feature, exploring feature concatenation and factorized bilinear pooling (FBP) for cross-modal feature fusion. With careful evaluation, we obtain 65.5% on the AFEW validation set and 62.48% on the test set and rank second in the challenge.",

      "text": "Emotion recognition(ER) has attracted increasing attention in academia and industry due to its wide range of applications such as human-computer interaction  [7] , clinical diagnosis  [19] , and cognitive science  [14] . Although great progress in the face and video analysis has been made  [4, 23, [26] [27] [28] [29] , audio-video emotion recognition in the wild remains a challenging problem due to the expression suffers from the large pose, illumination variance, occlusion, motion blur, etc.\n\nAudio-Video emotion recognition can be summarized as a simple pipeline shown in Fig  1 , which includes four parts, namely Video preprocessing, Feature Extraction, Feature Fusion, and Classifier. Specifically, video preprocessing refers to extract the spectrogram of the audio, the faces or landmarks of video. Feature extraction and feature fusion respectively extracts emotion features from the audio or visual signal and fuses emotion features into compact feature vectors, which are subsequently fed into a classifier for prediction.\n\nReviewing the methods of Audio-Video emotion recognition, we find that some methods emphasize feature extraction and other methods emphasize feature fusion. Yao et al  [31]  construct Holonet as discriminative feature extraction, which combines residual structure  [12]  and CReLU  [22]  to increase network depth and maintain efficiency. The EmotiW2017 winner team  [13]  gets robust feature extraction with Supervised Scoring Ensemble (SSE) which adds supervision to intermediate layers and shallow layers. Since SSE only uses high-level representations, Fan et al  [8]  further improve SSE by utilizing middle feature maps to provide more discriminative features. These methods mainly use average pooling to obtain video-level representation from frame-level.\n\nMany feature fusion strategies have been used in previous EmotiW challenges.  [9, 18, 25]  extract CNN-based frame features and use LSTM  [10]  or BLSTM  [11]  to fuse them.  [1, 15, 17]     maximum of the frame feature vectors. However, these methods ignore the importance of frames. Besides, all previous methods mainly apply score averaging or feature concatenation for audio-video fusion, which ignores the correlation between the features from different modalities.\n\nIn this paper, we exploit three types of intra-modal fusion methods, namely self-attention, relation-attention, and transformer  [24] . They are used to learn weights for frame features to highlight important frames. For cross-modal fusion, we explore feature concatenation and factorized bilinear pooling (FBP)  [32] . Besides, we evaluate different emotion features, including convolutional neural networks (CNN) for audio information with both speech-spectrogram and Log Mel-spectrogram and several facial features with different CNN models and different emotion pretrained strategies. Finally, we obtain 62.48% and rank second in the challenge.\n\nOur contributions and finds can be summarized as follows.\n\n• We experimentally show that better face recognition CNN models and choosing suitable emotion datasets to further pretrain the face CNN models is important. • We design three kinds of attention mechanisms for visual and audio feature fusion. • We apply a Factorized Bilinear Pooling (FBP) for crossmodal feature fusion.",

For AFEW dataset, If no face is detected in the picture, the entire frame is passed to the network.\n\nAudio processing and Spectrogram calculation. For each audio, the speech spectrogram and log Mel-spectrogram extraction process is consistent with  [32]  and  [3]  respectively.\n\nFor speech spectrogram, we use the Hamming window with 40 msec window size and 10 msec shift. Finally, the 200dimensional low-frequency part of the spectrogram is used as the input to the audio modality. As for log Mel-spectrogram, we calculate its deltas and delta-deltas.",

After that, we compute the features of these 18 transformation frames and average these 18 features as the feature 𝐹 -𝑀𝑒𝑎𝑛. For the feature 𝐹 -𝑀𝑒𝑎𝑛𝑆𝑡𝑑, we compute the average feature and feature standard deviation of these 18 features. We then concatenate the average feature and the standard deviation as 𝐹 -𝑀𝑒𝑎𝑛𝑆𝑡𝑑. For the feature 𝐹 -𝑛𝑜𝑟𝑚𝐹 𝐹𝑇 , we first compute the Fast Fourier transform(FFT) of the Basic Feature, and then normalize the feature and concatenate the real and imaginary parts as 𝐹 -𝑛𝑜𝑟𝑚𝐹 𝐹𝑇 . For the feature 𝐹 -𝐴𝑅-𝑀𝑒𝑎𝑛, 𝐴 means that the features are extracted by the models pre-trained on Affectnet, and 𝑅 by the models pre-trained on RAF-DB. we concatenate these two mean features of two different pretrained models as 𝐹 -𝐴𝑅-𝑀𝑒𝑎𝑛.
