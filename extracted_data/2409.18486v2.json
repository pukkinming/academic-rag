This approach has shown particular promise in enhancing performance on tasks requiring multi-step reasoning or mathematical problem-solving. By explicitly generating a series of coherent thoughts leading to a conclusion, models can tackle more sophisticated problems and provide more interpretable outputs.\n\nCompared to its predecessor GPT-4, o1 explicitly incorporates chain-of-thought into its inference process  [130] . While GPT-4 could utilize chain-of-thought reasoning when prompted, o1 integrates this approach as a fundamental part of its architecture. This allows o1 to \"think before it answers,\" producing a long internal chain of thought before responding to the user. This integration enables o1 to handle more complex reasoning tasks and provide more transparent explanations of its problemsolving process, potentially surpassing GPT-4's capabilities in areas requiring deep, multi-step reasoning.",

      "text": "Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) is a powerful technique that has significantly advanced the capabilities of large language models. It combines reinforcement learning principles with human preferences to fine-tune models, aligning their outputs more closely with human expectations.\n\nRLHF typically involves supervised fine-tuning, reward modeling based on human preferences, and policy optimization through reinforcement learning. For a more detailed discussion of RLHF, see Section 3.8.\n\nO1 employs advanced reinforcement learning techniques that significantly evolve beyond traditional RLHF methods. According to OpenAI, o1's performance consistently improves with more reinforcement learning (train-time compute) and with more time spent thinking (test-time compute)  [130] . This novel approach likely incorporates Chain-of-Thought reasoning into its reinforcement learning framework, which allows it to generate and evaluate multiple reasoning paths before producing a final output.\n\nUnlike traditional models that primarily spend compute during training, o1 scales its performance with increased compute during inference. This suggests a form of online learning or search that occurs at test time, which could involve real-time exploration and refinement of reasoning strategies. The model potentially rewards not just the final answer, but also the quality and effectiveness of its reasoning steps. O1 appears to have mechanisms for self-reflection and improvement, which implement a form of self-supervised learning where the model's thoughts become training data for further enhancement  [130, 119, 66] .\n\nIt might generate multiple candidate reasoning paths in parallel, which use reinforcement learning to score and select the most promising paths, similar to the Quiet-STaR method  [207, 119] . The model's ability to improve with more thinking time\" suggests a continuous learning loop, which possibly implements a form of meta-learning that adapts its reasoning strategies based on the specific task.\n\nThese advanced techniques represent a paradigm shift which focuses on enhancing the model's reasoning capabilities during inference, rather than solely aligning its outputs with human preferences during training.",

Unlike standard instruction-following datasets, which primarily test a model's ability to comprehend and follow simple commands or guidelines, this dataset is structured to challenge models with complex, domain-specific queries that require logical reasoning, numerical understanding, and advanced financial knowledge. For example, questions about optimizing trading algorithms, statistical model selection, or implementing automation in trading systems require much more than rote instruction following-they demand quantitative problem-solving and a deep understanding of financial markets.\n\nTo rigorously test and measure the performance of models using this dataset, a comprehensive evaluation framework is employed. Models are assessed based on their ability to accurately solve quantitative problems, generate coherent and logically sound responses, and correctly apply advanced financial concepts. Key performance metrics include accuracy for classification tasks, mean squared error (MSE) and root mean squared error (RMSE) for regression analyses, and precision and recall for information retrieval tasks. Additionally, the F1-score is utilized to provide a balanced measure of a model's precision and recall capabilities.\n\nBeyond quantitative metrics, qualitative assessments are conducted to evaluate the models' reasoning processes. This involves analyzing the logical flow of their solutions, the correctness of numerical computations, and the appropriateness of the financial methodologies applied. Models are also benchmarked against established financial theories and real-world market data to ensure their outputs are not only theoretically sound but also practically relevant. Human expert evaluations further validate the models' performance by comparing their answers to those provided by experienced professionals in the field of quantitative finance.\n\nThis multifaceted evaluation approach ensures that the models are not merely performing superficial computations but are genuinely understanding and engaging with complex financial concepts. It allows researchers and practitioners to identify specific areas where models excel or need improvement, thereby facilitating the development of more advanced and reliable quantitative trading systems.\n\nIn summary, the stock-trading-QA dataset excels in offering insights into critical areas of quantitative finance and trading models. Its highly specialized focus on topics like statistical modeling, automation, and signal integration makes it a valuable resource for testing the abilities of models in a quantitative context. By emphasizing model reasoning and numerical computation over simple instructionfollowing tasks, this dataset provides a robust platform for assessing the performance of AI models in handling complex financial queries.\n\no1-preview's mathematical reasoning capabilities enable it to perform complex, multi-factor, realtime quantitative model analysis, going beyond mere memorization. o1-preview can dynamically analyze numerous market variables, adjusting predictions and strategies in response to evolving conditions.

Our study will evaluate o1-preview model's ability to handle low-resource language translation by using data from the Cherokee Corpus Main Section of the Cherokee-English Dictionary (CED) project  [127] . The Cherokee Corpus is a collection of 1776 Cherokee sentences paired with corresponding English translations as ground truth. This resource will serve as a valuable benchmark to evaluate how effectively the model can handle translation tasks between Cherokee and English, particularly in the context of limited parallel data availability for the Cherokee language.\n\nThroughout the experimental phase, o1-preview generated translations and grammatical breakdowns for Cherokee sentences, focusing on both word meanings and sentence structure. The model was instructed to translate five Cherokee sentences and provide detailed analyses of key components, such as noun phrases and verb conjugations. Each analysis covered the subject, action, and contextual meaning of the sentence, demonstrating the model's ability to handle translations for a low-resource language.\n\nThe experimental results show that o1-preview can successfully translate common phrases and identify grammatical structures such as plural nouns and verb tenses in Cherokee. However, due to Cherokee being a low-resource language, the model sometimes fails to recognize certain words, leading to incomplete or inaccurate translations. Despite this, the model is able to provide reasonable guesses for unknown words, ensuring a degree of consistency in the overall translation. This ability to infer meaning allows the model to generate plausible translations, even when faced with unfamiliar vocabulary. However, expert intervention is still often required to refine these guesses and ensure full accuracy.

We defined five types of logical reasoning for manual instance classification, namely categorical reasoning, sufficient condition reasoning, necessary condition reasoning, disjunctive reasoning, and conjunction reasoning. o1-preview holds numerous application advantages in the field of logical reasoning. Firstly, it can efficiently handle a large amount of data. Whether it is complex text, images, or other forms of data, it can conduct rapid analysis in an extremely short time. Moreover, it has parallel processing capabilities and can simultaneously handle multiple logical reasoning tasks, greatly enhancing work efficiency. Secondly, it has high accuracy. Unaffected by human emotions, fatigue, and subjective biases, it always maintains objective and accurate reasoning. Based on sophisticated algorithms and extensive data analysis techniques, it can establish an accurate logical model to ensure reliable reasoning results. Furthermore, it has repeatability and consistency. For the same logical problem and input data, it can generate consistent reasoning results every time. The quality is stable. No matter when and where it is used, it can maintain a high-level reasoning ability. Additionally, it has strong learning and adaptability. Through continuous improvement and optimization based on new data and feedback, it can refine the logical reasoning model, adapt to different problem types and changing situations, and can also be applied in multiple fields by learning knowledge and logical rules in different fields. Finally, it can assist human decision-making, provide objective logical analysis and suggestions for human decision-makers, help make wiser decisions, and at the same time undertake some repetitive and cumbersome logical reasoning work, allowing humans to focus on more creative and strategic tasks.\n\nMultiple choice questions from the LogiQA dataset  [76]  were used for testing because logical reasoning problems do not rely heavily on complex contexts. This dataset consists of 8,678 QA instances.(Train:7376; Eval:651; Test:651)The files is divided into English version: Train, Eval, Test., and Chinese version: zh_train, zh_eval, zh_test.Each 8 lines constitute an example of a problem.

It is reported that the LogiQA dataset collects questions about logical understanding from public questions in the Chinese civil service examination, aiming to test candidates' critical thinking and problem-solving abilities. These raw data collected from the official website form 8678 question -answer data sample pairs.\n\nThe results show that o1-preview performs extremely well on this dataset, maintaining high accuracy even after multiple recalculations. When faced with interference factors in the options, it demonstrates strong anti-interference ability.

In this article, we explore the diagnostic capabilities of o1-preview by leveraging EHR data for patient diagnosis, aiming to assess how effectively o1-preview can interpret and analyze complex medical information.\n\nWe use the OHSUMED dataset (Download available online * )  [48, 47]  , a specialized subset of the MEDLINE database focused on biomedical literature, to evaluate the diagnostic capabilities of o1-preview. The OHSUMED dataset, curated by William Hersh and his team at Oregon Health Science University  [171] , was designed for interactive retrieval evaluation and research on large text collections. OHSUMED consists of medical abstracts drawn from 270 medical journals over five years  (1987) (1988) (1989) (1990) (1991) , comprising 13,929 documents. Each document is categorized into one of 23 cardiovascular disease categories, which presents a challenge for classification due to the large number of categories. To test o1-preview, we randomly selected 10 abstracts of biomedical texts related to different types of human cardiovascular disease from the MEDLINE database as our test cases.\n\nBy presenting each EHR text to o1-preview as a prompt and asking it to provide a diagnosis, the model has demonstrated the potential to support medical decision making. Notably, it tends to perform better with shorter texts, where diagnostic accuracy is higher. In longer and more complex records, while o1-preview still identifies key patterns, significant challenges remain in evaluating its performance.

      "text": "Educational measurement and psychometrics refer to the science and practice of developing the most appropriate test to accurately measure human characteristics, such as student knowledge, skills, abilities, and interests  [7, 64] . Since these characteristics cannot be directly measured, researchers often rely on samples of behaviors, such as test responses or observations, to make inferences about these characteristics. Specifically, measurement involves assigning numerical values to observed events based on predefined rules. For example, in a test, each correct response may be assigned one point, and the total score represents the sum of these points that serves as a measure of the knowledge of the student  [64] . Measurement in social sciences involves developing valid and reliable instruments, designing effective data collection procedures, analyzing and evaluating the quality of the data, and communicating the results to multiple stakeholders, such as educators, policymakers, students, and parents. The key goals of educational measurement are (1) to draw valid conclusions about the abilities, achievements, or attitudes of the students, (2) to assess progress towards educational objectives, and (3) to improve teaching and learning  [64] .\n\nTherefore, educational measurement and psychometrics is an interdisciplinary field closely intertwined with education, psychology, and statistics  [7] . However, it faces notable challenges, particularly due to limited research and development compared to fields like computer science. This scarcity is due in part to sluggish enrollment and slow growth in graduate education programs. From 2007 to 2016, the number of conferred doctoral degrees in areas like \"educational evaluation and research,\" \"educational statistics and research methods,\" and \"educational assessment, testing, and measurement\" ranged from a low of 128 in 2012 to a high of 157 in 2015  [73] . This restricted academic growth highlights potential limitations in training datasets for large language models. As such, exploring the performance of LLMs like o1-preview in the context of educational measurement and psychometrics becomes increasingly valuable for the development of the field. Notably, the dataset we used for this task was selected from multiple representative quiz questions in an introduction-level course named Measurement Theory based on Bandalos' textbook  [7]  for first-year graduate students. This dataset was built by content experts who had more than 10 years of research and teaching experience for a graduate-level course at James Madison University.",

In this section, we assess o1-preview's ability to analyze and evaluate the Affordable Care Act (ACA), one of the most significant healthcare reforms in recent U.S. history.\n\nOur focus is on the significant aspects of the ACA, such as the expansion of insurance coverage, improvements in access to care, and the broader public health impacts of these changes. The evaluation follows the Q&A format, where the prompts derived from the article named The Affordable Care Act at 10 Years: Evaluating the Evidence and Navigating an Uncertain Future  [169] . It is important to note that the dataset used for this task is limited in size and scope, consisting of key questions focused on ACA findings. Thus, our evaluation emphasizes depth of reasoning, factual accuracy, and consistency in how the model addresses complex health policy. For further evaluations, we suggest using larger datasets, such as the ACA state dataset  [44] , to provide more comprehensive training for the model.\n\nThe evaluation involved 10 distinct prompts, each addressing critical areas of the ACA's public health impact, including insurance coverage expansion, Medicaid expansion, surgical outcomes, preventive services, and healthcare disparities. These prompts challenged o1-preview to demonstrate nuanced reasoning and provide answers based on real-world health outcomes. The generated responses compared against expert insights from the article to determine their accuracy, depth, and relevance.\n\nOverall, this study determine how effectively o1-preview can process and reason about health policy, particularly its performance in analyzing the ACA. Although the current dataset size is limited, this evaluation offers insight into o1-preview's great potential for policy analysis and its capability to support public health decision-making processes.",

GeneGPT  [57]  use a language model as an agent to connect NCBI Web APIs, which use in-context learning and an augmented decoding algorithm to conduct automatic API calls. Recent work, GP-GPT  [112]  exhibits proficiency in accurately retrieving medical genetics information and executing common genomics analysis tasks, including information retrieval and relationship determination.\n\nIn this section, we seek to evaluate the model's ability to reason through problems related to medical genetics and genomics. To assess the model's genomics and genetics medical reasoning ability, we designed a set of experiments that focused on genomics questions and answers, where the model was required to generate reasonable answers towards the pre-defined genomics questions. These questions are about the relationship predictions and corresponding explanations. The tasks were created to test various aspects of genomics reasoning using a dataset comprising 20 question-and-answer (QA) tasks from the GenTunring benchmarks dataset  [52] . GeneTuring is a comprehensive QA database used to assess the performance of GPT models in genomics (Methods), which is based on bio-texts. It consists of twelve modules, encompassing a total of 600 question-answer pairs, which can be categorized into four main groups. These modules reflect tasks commonly encountered in genomics research. The experimental tasks were designed based on the GeneTuring benchmark. The delicate selected gene-disease-related QA terms from the GeneTuring database have been reviewed and significantly extended by manually adding the corresponding gene/disease information from OMIM  [5] . One extended term is utilized to build one full testing instance, which contains the instruction prompt, the gene's description and the disease's description. The model needed to follow the prompt instructions to respond to the gene-disease questions, in the meantime, the model was asked to give inference details and explanations step by step provided with the extended information.",

First introduced in the field of Natural Language Processing (NLP), it revolutionized the handling of long sequences through the use of a self-attention mechanism, setting new benchmarks in machine translation. This architectural breakthrough laid the groundwork for models like BERT and GPT  [26, 144] , which significantly improved performance across a wide range of NLP tasks. As datasets expanded and models grew more complex, Transformer-based models such as RoBERTa, GPT-2, and GPT-3  [95, 145, 14]  emerged, further pushing the limits of what was possible in natural language understanding.\n\nOpenAI's ChatGPT and GPT-4  [129, 128]  have been particularly noteworthy, demonstrating impressive language comprehension and reasoning capabilities. These models, thanks to vast training data and techniques like Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF)  [131] , perform effectively on a variety of tasks without the need for specific fine-tuning.

      "text": "With the rapid advancement of artificial intelligence technology, particularly in the field of natural language processing, the applications of large language models, such as OpenAI's GPT series models  [14] , are becoming increasingly widespread. These models have demonstrated significant capabilities in tasks such as text generation, translation, and dialogue systems. However, effectively guiding these models to generate outputs that meet expectations and avoiding erroneous or inappropriate content has become a pressing challenge. prompt engineering has emerged in response to this need. Its goal is to maximize the performance and practical value of LLMs by designing precise and effective input prompts that guide the models toward generating desired results.\n\nThe importance of prompt engineering is reflected on multiple levels. First, it serves as a crucial link between user needs and model capabilities. While LLMs possess powerful generative abilities, they may also produce content that deviates from the topic or contains bias  [160] . Through carefully designed prompts, users can better control the direction and quality of the model's outputs. Additionally, in the context of few-shot learning and zero-shot learning, prompt engineering can significantly enhance model performance  [36] . When large amounts of labeled data are lacking, well-crafted prompts can tap into the model's latent knowledge, enabling it to perform satisfactorily on new tasks. Furthermore, prompt engineering helps reduce model biases and errors, improving the accuracy and reliability of generated content, thereby enhancing user trust in the model  [10] .\n\nThere are two main approaches to prompt engineering: manual design and automated optimization. Manual prompt design is the most intuitive and commonly used method. Researchers or practitioners craft appropriate prompts based on their understanding of task requirements and model characteristics to guide the model in generating the desired output  [145] . For instance, in a question-answering system, including clear questions and necessary contextual information in the prompt can improve the accuracy of the model's responses. The advantage of this method lies in its flexibility, allowing designers to make adjustments according to specific situations. However, its disadvantage is the significant time and effort required, and the quality of the design heavily depends on the expertise and experience of the designer.\n\nTo improve efficiency and effectiveness, automated prompt optimization methods have gradually gained traction. Among these, Prompt Tuning  [72]  and Prefix Tuning  [81]  are representative techniques. Prompt Tuning adds trainable prompt vectors before the model input, enabling fine control over model behavior with minimal parameter adjustment. Prefix Tuning, on the other hand, inserts trainable prefixes into the model's hidden layers to influence its internal representations and generation process. The common feature of these methods is that they achieve excellent performance on specific tasks by fine-tuning only a small portion of the model's parameters, avoiding the need for large-scale model retraining and saving computational resources.\n\nDespite the significant results achieved in practice, prompt engineering still faces several challenges. First, there is the issue of interpretability and transparency. Automated prompts often involve high-dimensional continuous vectors, making it difficult to intuitively understand their specific impact on model outputs  [143] . Secondly, the generalizability of prompts across different tasks and domains is limited. A prompt effective for a specific task may not be directly applicable to other tasks, requiring redesign or adjustment  [179] . Moreover, controlling model bias and undesirable outputs, while avoiding the introduction of subjective or discriminatory content in prompts, is also an important area of research  [87] .\n\nLooking ahead, prompt engineering is expected to integrate with other techniques, such as humancomputer interaction and reinforcement learning, to further improve the efficiency and effectiveness of prompt design. At the same time, developing more intelligent prompt generation tools that leverage the model's own capabilities to assist in prompt design is a promising direction. Additionally, strengthening the theoretical foundation of prompt engineering and gaining a deeper understanding of the relationship between prompts and model behavior will help elevate the level of research in this field. As a critical component in the application of large language models, prompt engineering holds significant theoretical and practical value. Through the careful design and optimization of prompts, models can be effectively guided to generate high-quality, expectation-aligned content that meets diverse task requirements. Although challenges remain, continued research and technological development will undoubtedly enable prompt engineering to play an increasingly important role, leading to new breakthroughs and innovations in the field of AI.",

      "text": "Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting is a powerful technique that enhances the reasoning capabilities of large language models. Specifically, CoT prompting enables models to solve complex problems by generating intermediate reasoning steps instead of directly providing the final answer. This approach is particularly effective for multi-step tasks, such as mathematical problem-solving and logical reasoning  [193] . CoT aims to overcome the limitations of traditional prompting methods. In traditional prompting, models are typically given input-output examples and are expected to produce a final answer directly. However, this method often falls short for tasks that require multi-step reasoning  [147] . CoT addresses this issue by instructing the model to explicitly articulate each step in the reasoning process.\n\nFollowing the initial work on CoT, subsequent research on annotation methods can be categorized into manual, automatic, and semi-automatic approaches  [19] . Manual CoT relies on human-crafted prompts to guide the reasoning process. For instance, the Prompting-based Arithmetic Learner (PAL) framework uses programming-language rationales to generate programs, manually constructing prompts for arithmetic tasks  [35] . On the other hand, automatic prompting techniques like zero-shot CoT and Auto-CoT generate reasoning steps automatically  [61, 214] . Some research has focused on semi-automatic methods that combine automatic generation with limited human supervision. For example, AutoMate CoT  [164]  and BoostedPrompt  [136]  use a small set of human-annotated rationales to bootstrap the process, enabling the generation of higher-quality reasoning chains even in the absence of extensive labeled data.\n\nBeyond basic CoT prompting, various extensions have been developed to tackle specific tasks or challenges. For instance, techniques like Self-Refine  [116]  and CoSelfRevisions  [69]  allow models to revise or verify their reasoning processes as they generate solutions. Other advanced frameworks, such as Tree of Thought (ToT)  [202]  and Graph of Thought (GoT)  [12] , further extend the CoT structure by exploring multiple reasoning paths or incorporating network-based structures.",

These models have significantly impacted numerous domains, including computer vision, natural language processing, and human-computer interaction.\n\nThe evolution of MLLMs can be traced back to early work on combining visual and textual information.  [111]  proposed ViLBERT, one of the first models to jointly process visual and linguistic inputs using a two-stream architecture. Building upon this foundation,  [84]  introduced Oscar, which utilized object tags as anchor points to align image regions with text tokens, significantly improving vision-language pre-training. These early efforts laid the groundwork for more sophisticated multimodal models. A significant breakthrough came with the introduction of CLIP by  [146] , which demonstrated the effectiveness of contrastive learning in aligning visual and textual representations at scale. This work not only achieved impressive zero-shot performance across various tasks but also paved the way for subsequent research into scaling multi-modal models to billions of parameters. Following this trend,  [3]  presented Flamingo, a visual language model capable of few-shot learning across a wide range of vision and language tasks. The model's architecture, combining a vision encoder with a language model through cross-attention layers, has become a blueprint for many subsequent MLLMs. As the field progressed, researchers began to focus on enhancing the cognitive abilities of MLLMs. In 2023,  [80]  introduced CogVLM, a large vision-language model that achieves strong performance across various vision-language tasks while maintaining high efficiency. The model's cognitive training approach enables it to handle complex reasoning tasks involving both visual and textual inputs, representing a significant step forward in multi-modal understanding. Concurrently, efforts were made to improve the versatility and applicability of MLLMs.  [210]  proposed mPLUG-Owl, an MLLM that demonstrates impressive capabilities in multi-modal dialogue and image editing. The model's unique architecture allows for efficient fine-tuning and adaptation to downstream tasks, making it particularly valuable for real-world applications. This work highlighted the potential of MLLMs to bridge the gap between research and practical implementation. More recently,  [17]  introduced MM1, a multi-modal model that achieves state-of-the-art performance on a wide range of vision and language tasks. MM1's novel pre-training strategy, which incorporates large-scale web-crawled image-text pairs, enables the model to develop a deep understanding of the relationships between visual and textual content. This research underscores the importance of diverse and extensive training data in developing robust MLLMs. As the capabilities of MLLMs continue to expand, researchers have increasingly focused on addressing key challenges in the field. One such challenge is the need for more efficient architectures and compression techniques, given the growing size of these models.  [189]  made significant strides in this direction by proposing a novel pruning method that substantially reduces the computational requirements of MLLMs without sacrificing performance. This work exemplifies the ongoing efforts to make MLLMs more accessible and deployable in resource-constrained environments. Another important trend in MLLM research is the emphasis on enhancing multi-modal reasoning capabilities.  [200]  contributed to this area by introducing a new benchmark for evaluating complex reasoning tasks that require the integration of visual and textual information. This work not only provides valuable tools for assessing MLLM performance but also highlights the increasing sophistication of tasks that these models are expected to handle. As MLLMs become more powerful and widely adopted, the research community has also turned its attention to addressing ethical concerns such as bias, fairness, and privacy.  [60]  made a significant contribution in this regard by proposing a framework for evaluating and mitigating biases in multi-modal models. This research underscores the importance of responsible AI development and the need to consider the societal implications of advancing MLLM technology.\n\nIn conclusion, the field of multi-modal large language models has seen rapid and multifaceted progress in recent years. From foundational architectures to state-of-the-art models with sophisticated reasoning capabilities, MLLMs have evolved to become powerful tools for understanding and generating content across multiple modalities. As research continues to advance, we can expect further improvements in model performance, efficiency, and ethical considerations. These developments promise to pave the way for more powerful, versatile, and responsible AI systems that can seamlessly integrate information from diverse sources and modalities.",

      "text": "Fine-tuning in deep learning adapts pre-trained models to specific tasks by adjusting their parameters, offering significant advantages over training from scratch. This technique not only improves model performance while reducing training time and data requirements, but also allows for specialization in targeted domains. There are two main approaches: full parameter fine-tuning, which adjusts all model parameters, and parameter-efficient fine-tuning, which modifies only a subset. Fine-tuning is particularly beneficial for specialized tasks, enabling models to learn domain-specific vocabulary and contextual nuances crucial in fields like medicine or law. It enhances the model's ability to produce structured outputs consistently, adhere to specific guidelines, and consider ethical implications relevant to particular applications. Whether through full or parameter-efficient methods, fine-tuning is essential for tailoring large language models to specialized use cases, significantly improving their accuracy, reliability, and practical applicability in targeted domains while balancing performance and efficiency.\n\nFull parameter fine-tuning  [211]  is a comprehensive adaptation method for pre-trained models to new tasks. In this process, every layer and parameter of the model is updated and optimized, allowing the model to better learn the features of the new task and improve its performance. However, due to the large number of parameters to be adjusted, full parameter fine-tuning often requires significant computational resources and time. More crucially, it can lead to \"catastrophic forgetting\"  [90] , where the model forgets the knowledge it has previously learned when learning new tasks. This phenomenon is particularly prominent when the model is large and the tasks are highly dissimilar. Therefore, full parameter fine-tuning is generally suitable for scenarios with sufficient data, abundant computational resources, and a strong correlation between the new and old tasks. To mitigate catastrophic forgetting, techniques such as parameter-efficient fine-tuning and knowledge distillation can be considered.\n\nParameter-efficient fine-tuning  [41]  is a technique that adapts large pre-trained models to new tasks without significantly increasing the number of model parameters. The core idea is to achieve transfer learning across different tasks by fine-tuning specific parts of the model or introducing additional modules while maintaining model efficiency. Common parameter-efficient fine-tuning methods include partial fine-tuning, adapters, prompt tuning, prefix tuning, and LoRA  [53] . Partial fine-tuning only adjusts the top or a few layers of the model, preserving the general knowledge acquired during pre-training; adapters insert small adapter modules into each layer of the model and only train the parameters of these modules; prompt tuning guides the model to generate the desired output by adding specific prompts to the input text; prefix tuning adds learnable prefixes to the beginning of the input sequence and controls the model's output by adjusting these prefixes; LoRA performs low-rank decomposition of the model's attention matrices and only trains the decomposed matrices. The advantages of parameter-efficient fine-tuning include reduced computational cost, faster training, alleviated overfitting, and improved generalization. The choice of parameter-efficient fine-tuning method depends on the specific task, dataset, and available computational resources.",

They have made significant advancements in various fields, including robotics, finance, and healthcare. In robotics, AI agents have enabled autonomous navigation and manipulation, exemplified by the development of self-driving vehicles in recent years  [6] . Advancements in deep reinforcement learning have led to AI agents capable of complex decision-making in dynamic environments  [178] . These agents operate without continuous human intervention, leading to increased efficiency in tasks such as data analysis and realtime decision-making. They learn from interactions with their environment, allowing them to adapt to new situations and improve performance over time. The development of model-based reinforcement learning algorithms has been crucial in this regard  [187] . However, designing AI agents involves complex algorithms and substantial computational resources, which can be cost-prohibitive. Many AI agents are task-specific and struggle to generalize knowledge to different domains. Additionally, autonomous decision-making raises issues related to accountability, transparency, and potential biases encoded in the agents. Recent studies have highlighted that AI systems can perpetuate existing biases, leading to unfair outcomes in applications such as hiring and lending  [118] . In finance, AI agents are used in algorithmic trading, risk assessment, and fraud detection, improving efficiency and accuracy. Research has demonstrated that AI-driven high-frequency trading can influence market dynamics and liquidity  [8] . In healthcare, AI agents assist in patient monitoring, diagnostic support, and personalized treatment planning. Deep learning models have been developed for medical image analysis, aiding in the early detection of diseases such as cancer  [77] .\n\nRetrieval-augmented generation (RAG) combines large language models with information retrieval systems to generate responses grounded in external data sources. This approach enhances the factual accuracy and relevance of generated content. By accessing up-to-date information during generation, RAG models produce more accurate and contextually relevant outputs, overcoming the limitations of static training data. Lewis et al.  [75]  introduced the RAG model, which integrates a pretrained language model with a neural retriever to improve performance on knowledge-intensive tasks. Subsequent research has built upon this framework to enhance the capabilities of language models. For example, Guu et al.  [40]  proposed REALM, which enables language models to retrieve and reason over large corpora. The effectiveness of RAG models heavily relies on the quality and reliability of the retrieved data. The retrieval process adds latency and requires additional computational resources. Integrating retrieval mechanisms with generative models introduces challenges in system design and optimization. Despite these challenges, RAG models have been successfully applied in various domains. In customer support, they power intelligent chatbots that provide accurate and context-specific assistance to users  [31] . In education, they generate personalized learning content by retrieving relevant materials tailored to individual learner needs  [29] .\n\nDespite the advancements brought by AI agents and RAG, limitations persist. AI agents often lack the ability to generalize across tasks, and RAG models can be constrained by the quality of their data sources and computational demands. The new o1-preview model emerges as a response to these challenges, aiming to combine the autonomy of AI agents with the knowledge integration of RAG while mitigating their respective drawbacks. The o1-preview model is anticipated to enhance generalization by leveraging advanced learning architectures, enabling effective performance across diverse tasks without extensive retraining. It is designed to optimize performance by reducing computational overhead, allowing faster inference even when accessing external data. Additionally, it aims to improve reliability by incorporating robust mechanisms for data verification to ensure that outputs are accurate and trustworthy. The o1-preview model holds promise in advancing the field of AI by addressing the limitations of existing approaches and providing a more versatile and reliable framework for autonomous agents and knowledge integration.",

Based on the training mechanisms and cognitive frameworks of LLMs, their deficiencies in reasoning are evident. Specifically, addressing intricate problems necessitates deliberate and meticulous contemplation. However, due to the limited guidance provided during the training phase, LLMs are often constrained by token-level, left-to-right decision-making processes during inference  [11] . When faced with complex reasoning challenges, humans typically employ diverse cognitive abilities and interact with tools, external knowledge, and environmental information to accomplish tasks. Replicating this level of cognitive function in LLMs remains a significant challenge  [65] .\n\nIn response to these limitations, several approaches have been proposed to emulate human reasoning processes. One foundational method is the Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting  [193] , which involves providing LLMs with examples that include detailed intermediate reasoning steps. By explicitly modeling the reasoning process, CoT enables LLMs to tackle arithmetic, commonsense reasoning, and problem-solving tasks more effectively. Building upon CoT, the Tree-of-Thought (ToT) framework  [202]  models the reasoning process as a search through a tree of possible thought sequences. This approach allows the model to explore multiple reasoning paths simultaneously, enhancing its ability to handle ambiguous or complex tasks by considering a broader range of possibilities. The Self-Consistency technique  [188]  improves reasoning by generating multiple reasoning paths and selecting the most consistent answer across these paths. This method reduces the impact of reasoning errors in any single chain and improves overall answer accuracy.\n\nAnother significant advancement is the integration of external tools into the reasoning process. The ReAct framework  [201]  combines reasoning and acting by enabling LLMs to interact with external environments and tools, such as calculators or knowledge bases. This integration allows LLMs to perform computations, retrieve up-to-date information, and validate reasoning steps, thereby enhancing factual accuracy and reducing hallucinations. By leveraging the strengths of both internal reasoning processes and external resources, ReAct represents a promising approach to bridging the gap between LLMs and human-like reasoning capabilities.\n\nThe evolution of reasoning methods in LLMs reflects a shift from implicit, data-driven learning to approaches that incorporate explicit reasoning processes. Early LLMs relied on large-scale pre-training, hoping that reasoning abilities would emerge from vast amounts of data. However, this proved insufficient for tasks requiring logical deductions and complex problem-solving. The introduction of prompt engineering techniques, such as CoT, marked a significant advancement by leveraging the models' capabilities through carefully designed prompts that guide the reasoning process. Subsequent methods, such as ToT and Self-Consistency, focused on exploring multiple reasoning paths and selecting the most consistent answers, further enhancing the models' ability to handle ambiguous or complex tasks.\n\nThe integration of external tools and environments, as exemplified by the ReAct framework, represents a crucial step towards emulating human-like reasoning in LLMs. By combining internal reasoning processes with the ability to interact with external resources, these approaches more closely mimic the diverse cognitive abilities employed by humans when faced with complex challenges. As research in this field continues to progress, we can expect further advancements in the development of LLMs that exhibit increasingly sophisticated reasoning capabilities, bringing us closer to the goal of achieving truly intelligent and versatile artificial intelligence systems.",

      "text": "Generating responses that satisfy human expectations is a critical challenge in the development of large language models. Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback  [18, 220]  has emerged as a promising solution to this challenge, enabling the creation of some of the most widely deployed AI models to date.\n\nThe development of RLHF can be traced back to the work of Schulman et al.  [159] , who proposed a novel reinforcement learning approach that indirectly learns reward functions based on human preferences. This method simplified human involvement by having humans qualitatively compare the quality of two trajectories, achieving good results in simulated robotics and Atari games. In the same year, OpenAI introduced the Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) algorithm  [18] , which has been widely applied in the RLHF stage of LLMs. PPO optimizes the policy function to maximize cumulative returns while maintaining similarity between new and old policies, effectively avoiding instability and high variance problems during training.\n\nStiennon et al.  [166]  further advanced RLHF by replacing automated evaluation methods with human preferences as the training objective. Starting from an initial model fine-tuned with Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT), they collected samples through human comparisons, built a reward model, and then optimized using reinforcement learning strategies, significantly improving the quality of summaries.\n\nA significant milestone was reached with InstructGPT  [131] , which combined RLHF with GPT-3. This approach fine-tuned GPT-3 through human feedback to improve the model's ability to follow user intent, achieving performance improvements while reducing the number of parameters.\n\nIn the context of RLHF, we define:\n\n• States (s): The current context or prompt.\n\n• Actions (a): The model's generated responses.\n\n• Reward (r): Feedback based on human preferences.\n\n• Policy (π): The strategy the model uses to generate responses.\n\nThe standard RLHF fine-tuning process typically consists of three stages:\n\n• Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT): This initial stage adapts the pre-trained language model to generate outputs that align with human-written examples of desired behavior.\n\n• Reward Modeling (RM): A reward model is trained on pairs of model outputs, where humans have indicated a preference for one output over the other. This model learns to predict these preferences, enabling it to generate reward signals for new, unseen model outputs.\n\n• Reinforcement Learning (RL): The language model is fine-tuned using reinforcement learning to maximize the rewards predicted by the reward model.\n\nWithin this framework, various algorithms have been developed to implement and optimize the reinforcement learning process. Two prominent approaches are Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) and Direct Preference Optimization (DPO):\n\nProximal Policy Optimization (PPO)  [159] :\n\n• Implements the RM and RL stages separately.\n\n• Uses an explicit reward model trained on human preferences.\n\n• Updates the policy by optimizing a clipped surrogate objective:\n\nwhere r t (θ) is the probability ratio between the new and old policy, and Ât is the estimated advantage.\n\nPPO's key contribution is its ability to perform stable policy updates while maintaining good sample efficiency. The \"proximal\" aspect of PPO is particularly important in the context of language models, as it helps maintain semantic consistency by ensuring that policy updates do not deviate too far from the previous policy.\n\nDirect Preference Optimization (DPO)  [148] :\n\n• Combines the RM and RL stages into a single optimization process.\n\n• Bypasses the need for an explicit reward model.\n\n• Directly optimizes the policy based on preferred responses:\n\nwhere y w and y l are the winning and losing responses, respectively, and r θ represents the policy's preference between responses.\n\nDPO's key contribution is simplifying the RLHF process by eliminating the need for a separate reward model and policy optimization step, potentially leading to more efficient training.\n\nThe application of RLHF has expanded beyond text-only models to include multi-modal large models and text-to-image generation models. GPT-4  [2]  demonstrated the effectiveness of RLHF in multi-modal contexts, while numerous works have leveraged RLHF to enhance model performance in text-to-image generation  [71, 30, 13] , showing good results in meeting human preferences, mitigating biases, and improving text-image alignment.",

The iterative nature of its reasoning process can lead to slower output times compared to models optimized for speed, such as GPT-4  [2] , in tasks that do not necessitate deep analytical capabilities. This trade-off between depth and speed is a critical consideration in applications where time sensitivity is paramount. It is essential to recognize these limitations and to deploy o1-preview in contexts where its strengths can be fully leveraged, while relying on alternative models for tasks that prioritize speed over depth.\n\nThe selection of evaluation domains for o1-preview was strategic, aiming to encompass a broad spectrum of complex reasoning tasks. These domains, ranging from computational mathematics to legal analysis, serve as a crucible for the model's capabilities, testing its adaptability and generalizability across different types of cognitive challenges  [101] .

The insights gleaned from this evaluation will not only inform the refinement of o1-preview but also contribute to the broader field of AI research, providing valuable lessons for the development of future models.\n\nThe implications of this evaluation extend beyond academic interest into the practical realms of technology and industry  [93] . By delineating the strengths and weaknesses of o1-preview, we provide a roadmap for the integration of advanced AI into fields that stand to benefit from enhanced reasoning capabilities. The insights gleaned from this study will inform the development of future LLMs, potentially revolutionizing sectors such as finance, healthcare, and education by automating complex decision-making processes and augmenting human expertise. Furthermore, this work contributes to the broader goal of advancing artificial general intelligence, pushing the boundaries of what machines can achieve and how they can collaborate with humans to solve some of the most pressing challenges of our time.\n\nIn conclusion, the evaluation of o1-preview in complex reasoning tasks is a critical step towards harnessing the full potential of AI in transforming various sectors of society. Through a rigorous and comprehensive assessment, we aim to unlock new possibilities for innovation and progress, while also identifying areas for improvement and further research. The o1-preview's performance in these evaluations will not only inform its immediate applications but also shape the trajectory of AI development, ensuring that future systems are better equipped to tackle the complex challenges that define our era.

      "text": "In the testing phase, we conducted a rigorous evaluation of the o1-preview model, deploying it across a diverse array of domain-specific tasks to comprehensively assess its performance and reasoning capabilities. The primary goal was to determine the model's ability to generate coherent, contextually appropriate, and logically consistent responses when confronted with challenges across various specialized fields. This was achieved by using domain-specific prompts and comparing the model's responses to pre-established benchmarks, thereby evaluating how effectively o1-preview could adapt to the nuanced demands of different domains.\n\nOur testing approach followed a unified, systematic procedure designed to evaluate o1-preview's performance across several fields, including medicine, education, robotics, mathematics, etc. Each domain was chosen to highlight different aspects of the model's capabilities, ranging from multi-step reasoning and technical problem-solving to real-time decision-making and knowledge application. For example, in the medical domain, we used structured prompts that simulated real-world clinical scenarios, testing the model's ability to interpret patient data and suggest plausible diagnoses or treatments. In robotics, the model was tasked with generating code or instructions for various robotic tasks, emphasizing its ability to apply logic to dynamic, real-world operations. Similarly, the mathematics prompts required the model to solve intricate problems that necessitated a deep understanding of formulas, theorems, and multi-step problem-solving processes.\n\nFor each domain, we meticulously curated the datasets to ensure that they were representative of the types of challenges encountered by professionals in those fields. The structured prompts were designed not only to test the model's ability to retrieve factual information but also to assess how well it could adapt its reasoning to domain-specific contexts. In each case, we analyzed o1-preview's ability to generalize across tasks while maintaining coherence, accuracy, and relevance.\n\nThe evaluation went beyond simply recording o1-preview's correctness. Each response was critically analyzed for logical coherence, contextual relevance, and domain appropriateness. In domains like medicine, where incorrect responses could have serious real-world implications, we carefully assessed the model's ability to synthesize data from complex scenarios and provide plausible, evidence-based solutions. The same level of scrutiny was applied in mathematics, where multi-step reasoning is essential, and in robotics, where real-time task generation demands precision.\n\nMoreover, we ensured that the evaluation was exhaustive by including multi-layered analyses-ranging from granular error breakdowns to broader assessments of how o1-preview handled domain-specific intricacies. For instance, when assessing its performance in education, we examined how effectively the model could generate accurate, didactic responses that were pedagogically sound. The detailed analysis provided insights into the model's ability to not only answer questions but also facilitate learning.\n\nOne of the key outcomes of this testing process was the identification of areas where o1-preview excelled, as well as those where further refinement is required. Its capacity to adapt to the unique demands of each domain while producing coherent and logically sound responses highlights its potential as a tool for a wide range of professional applications. However, the testing also revealed certain limitations, particularly in tasks requiring more intricate domain-specific reasoning, suggesting areas for further improvement.",

Table  2  presents the detailed results of o1-preview's performance in our coding evaluation. Each problem within the contest is assigned a score proportional to its difficulty, with more challenging problems receiving higher scores. The maximum total score achievable in each contest is 21 points. Notably, both of these problems were categorized as \"hard\" level. Despite taking several minutes to generate solutions, o1-preview was unable to pass these challenges within the three submission attempts.\n\nFor the failed problem in Weekly Contest 413, o1-preview initially generated a solution that was correct but exceeded the time limit. Subsequent submissions in the second and third attempts resulted in incorrect answers. Similarly, for the problem in Biweekly Contest 138, o1-preview provided incorrect solutions for all three attempts.\n\nDespite these challenges, o1-preview demonstrated comparable or faster code generation times relative to top human competitors. This indicates that o1-preview possesses a strong reasoning capability and can effectively handle the majority of coding tasks. However, in particularly complex or computationally intensive cases, the model's performance remains limited, as observed in these difficult problems.\n\nFigures  3  and 4  illustrate two examples from our coding evaluation. In Figure  3 , o1-preview demonstrates its ability to efficiently solve easy-level problems, completing the task with minimal computation time and successfully passing all test cases. However, as shown in Figure  4 , the model encounters difficulties with a hard-level problem. In this failure case, o1-preview initially generated a correct solution, but the solution exceeded the time limit. Following the first submission, the model became trapped in a cycle of attempting to optimize the code's time complexity, which resulted in incorrect solutions in subsequent attempts. This example highlights the model's struggle with complex problems requiring significant optimization, where its efforts to improve efficiency led to repeated errors.  In this case, o1-preview generates the correct code. However, this code has exceeded the time limit.

      "text": "As educators explore new technologies to enhance student learning, o1-preview may serve as an important teaching and learning assistant in helping students improve their writing skills. Qualitative analysis of the o1-preview model's application in student writing in  Figures 14, 15, 16  has shown promising results in several areas. For example, the above screenshots reveal that o1-preview appears to be able to provide effective writing support, including improving linguistic accuracy, enhancing writing coherence, and generating writing outlines and initial ideas. However, while these functions seem to contribute positively, the overall impact may vary depending on the specific needs of learners and the contexts in which the tool is used. The initial analysis found that the AI-generated responses sometimes follow a rigid, machine-like template and lack citations, which may lead students to passively adopt these structures, ultimately limiting the effectiveness and creativity in their writing. Therefore, it is important for educators to understand that while GenAI can be a valuable supplement, it cannot replace the essential human guidance in writing education. Most importantly, the current AI model is still under development, which means its limitations must be carefully considered in educational contexts  [182, 181, 68] . We hope that future research will further investigate and examine o1's functions and its effectiveness in higher education, providing deeper insights into how it can be best utilized across various learning contexts.",

We provided the model with a carefully designed prompt aimed at guiding it to effectively arrange objects within a given room type. We use the prompt from LLplace  [199] . The specific prompt is as follows:\n\nYou are a skilled room layout designer. Your task is to arrange [Objects] within a given [Room Type] effectively. Follow these guidance to complete your design: \"object\": \"object\", \"coordinates\": [ \"x\": x, \"y\": y, \"z\": z ], \"rotate\": [ \"angle\": r ]\n\nThe centroid of the room is \"x\": 0.00, \"y\": 0.00, \"z\": 0.00 . Through experiments, we found that model o1-preview performed exceptionally well in the task of room layout generation. The model was able to accurately extract the room type, objects, and bounding box sizes from the provided JSON data, ensuring the correct interpretation of fundamental information. It conducted an in-depth spatial relationship analysis of the objects within the specified room type, successfully avoiding overlap between objects in most cases, while also considering spatial factors such as accessibility and aesthetics.\n\nIn the layout design task, the model strictly adhered to the guidelines, precisely determining the positions of all objects and ensuring that their bounding boxes did not overlap. The resulting layouts were highly functional and visually pleasing. Notably, the model prioritized placing objects at the edges of the room, a strategy that effectively increased the sense of spaciousness. Objects in the layout were generally aligned, and chairs were correctly placed near tables or desks and faced them, meeting both functional and aesthetic requirements.\n\nHowever, it is necessary to rigorously point out that in a small number of examples, there were instances of object overlap in three-dimensional space, indicating that the results were not entirely accurate. To comprehensively evaluate the model's performance, we conducted three-dimensional visualizations of each generated layout; specific details are shown in  Figures 17, 18, 19, 20.  Additionally, we reported the three-dimensional spatial coordinates and rotation angles of each object in the required detailed JSON format.\n\nIn summary, o1-preview demonstrated strong capabilities in the task of room layout generation.\n\nAlthough it accurately understood the requirements of the prompt and reflected a high level of functionality and aesthetics in the generated layouts, there were still some minor inaccuracies, such as overlaps in certain examples, indicating room for improvement. The model has broad application prospects in fields such as interior design and virtual reality, but future work should focus on enhancing its accuracy in complex layouts.",

ChipNeMo's response was functional but relatively basic, offering a clear, step-by-step approach to configuring the random test seeds. However, it lacked deeper insights into how this process could be optimized, especially when scaling for large simulations-a crucial factor in chip design where extensive random testing is essential for validating design robustness. On the other hand, o1-preview's response was more comprehensive. In addition to covering the basic configuration steps, it offered a deeper explanation on how to parallelize the test process, ensuring that the tests were not only random but also scalable. This detailed approach reflects a higher level of expertise, as it anticipates potential challenges such as random number generation integrity and error handling during large-scale simulations, which are critical for efficient testing in high-stakes environments like semiconductor design. From a professional chip design perspective, o1-preview's response demonstrates superior problem-solving skills, particularly in managing the intricacies of large-scale test simulations, making it the more valuable solution for real-world engineering scenarios.\n\nIn the second example (Figure  22 ), the task was to write a SystemVerilog assertion to check if signal A becomes true within five clock cycles of signal B being true. ChipNeMo's response was technically correct, providing a solid and clear assertion that could be implemented effectively. However, while the explanation was accurate, it did not delve into any advanced verification challenges, such as handling asynchronous inputs or potential pitfalls that might arise in different clocking environments. o1-preview, in contrast, not only provided a correct assertion but also took the opportunity to explain how this assertion could behave in different scenarios, such as varying clock domains and frequency mismatches. Additionally, o1-preview discussed how engineers could modify the assertion for more complex verification setups, ensuring that it accounted for edge cases that are common in real-world chip designs. This level of detail and foresight is indicative of a deeper understanding of the verification process, making o1-preview's response significantly more useful to engineers dealing with complex, time-sensitive verification tasks in chip design.\n\nIn the third example (Figure  23 ), the query was about retiming stages and their purpose in digital circuit design. ChipNeMo provided a thorough response, outlining the key benefits of retiming, such as reducing critical path delays, improving throughput through pipelining, and optimizing power consumption. While this explanation was comprehensive, it presented a list of advantages in a somewhat generic manner without exploring the more intricate trade-offs involved in retiming decisions. o1-preview, however, offered a more nuanced response. In addition to explaining the same core benefits, it discussed the potential drawbacks of retiming, such as increased latency in certain paths or complications with meeting tight setup and hold time requirements. Furthermore, o1-preview offered advice on how to balance retiming with other optimization techniques, such as logic restructuring, to achieve the best overall design outcome. This consideration of trade-offs and broader optimization strategies demonstrates a more expert-level understanding of the circuit design process. From an engineering standpoint, o1-preview's ability to not only highlight the advantages but also address the potential downsides of retiming provides a far more insightful and practical response.",

      "text": "In the context of EDA Script Generation, both o1-preview and ChipNeMo were tested on their ability to generate scripts for EDA tools, a critical task in chip design automation. These scripts are pivotal in automating various stages of chip development, such as logic verification and circuit optimization, which require both precise coding and a deep understanding of the chip design environment.\n\nIn Figure  24 , one such prompt tasked the models with writing a TOOL1 code to count the number of flip-flop cells within a given rectangular boundary, a common operation in physical design when determining logic distribution and optimizing layout. ChipNeMo's response provided a basic solution, covering the mechanics of how to traverse the design hierarchy and count the flip-flops in the specified region. While it delivered the correct structure and functionality, the response was somewhat limited in its flexibility. The code did not explore advanced features like handling edge cases (such as overlapping regions or boundary conditions) or optimizing the search algorithm for larger designs, both of which are essential considerations in production environments where efficiency is crucial.\n\nIn contrast, o1-preview's response offered a more nuanced solution. The model not only provided the core code but also discussed potential optimization strategies, such as how to efficiently traverse large designs and how to handle boundary conditions more gracefully. Moreover, o1-preview included comments and suggestions for extending the functionality, such as adding the ability to count other types of cells or integrating the script into a larger automation flow for design rule checking. This response demonstrated a deeper understanding of the complexities involved in real-world EDA environments, where flexibility and scalability are paramount. o1-preview was able to anticipate potential issues that engineers might face when deploying this script in large-scale designs, making its response significantly more applicable for practical use in a professional setting.\n\nShown in Figure  25 , another query asked the models to write a TOOL2 TCL procedure to find intersecting logic between two pins, a task that typically involves traversing the netlist and analyzing connections between logic elements. ChipNeMo's response was straightforward, generating a functional TCL procedure that correctly identified the logic elements between two pins. However, the response lacked depth in terms of optimizing the logic traversal for large-scale designs or handling more complex netlist structures with multiple levels of hierarchy, which are often encountered in modern chip design.\n\no1-preview, on the other hand, delivered a more comprehensive response by not only generating the procedure but also discussing the nuances of handling different types of netlist structures, such as flat versus hierarchical designs. The model provided suggestions on optimizing the traversal algorithm to minimize runtime in large designs, an essential consideration in EDA where scripts often need to handle millions of logic elements. Furthermore, o1-preview anticipated potential edge cases, such as how to handle pins with multiple fan-outs or fan-ins, and proposed extensions to the procedure for handling such scenarios. This level of detail illustrates a greater understanding of the complexities involved in chip design and the need for adaptable, efficient scripts in EDA environments.",

      "text": "In the context of Bug Summary & Analysis, both o1-preview and ChipNeMo were tested on their ability to analyze bug reports related to silicon current measurement in chip fabrics, a crucial task in chip power optimization shown in Figure  26 . Bug analysis in semiconductor design involves not only identifying the root cause of the problem but also summarizing the issue in a way that allows teams to prioritize and resolve it efficiently.\n\nFor the given bug, the report concerns a request to measure the power consumption of fabric macros in a chip under varying levels of activity and voltage conditions. This is a typical challenge during the design-for-test (DFT) phase, where engineers need to evaluate how closely the silicon's power consumption aligns with pre-silicon estimates. The goal is to isolate the power consumed by specific parts of the chip to improve the accuracy of power models and optimize power efficiency.\n\nChipNeMo's response was technically sound but somewhat formulaic in structure. It provided both a technical summary and a managerial summary, effectively breaking down the core components of the issue. The technical summary outlined the conditions for power measurement, such as test module activity percentages and the required voltage corners. However, the managerial summary simply relayed the back-and-forth discussion between users without delving into any deeper insights or offering a clear action plan. ChipNeMo's response focused heavily on summarizing the immediate facts of the bug report without providing much context or additional analysis on the implications of the power measurement for future designs or suggesting strategies for correlating silicon data with pre-silicon estimates.\n\nIn contrast, o1-preview's response offered a much more thorough analysis of the bug. While covering the same technical and managerial aspects as ChipNeMo, o1-preview also addressed the broader implications of the power measurement. It analyzed how the fabric power data could influence future chip designs, particularly in optimizing power density and improving area efficiency-factors that are critical in modern chip development. Furthermore, o1-preview provided a more in-depth interpretation of the request, offering suggestions on how to approach the power measurement with more refined isolation techniques and data breakdowns to ensure more accurate comparisons with pre-silicon estimates. It also provided a clearer task assignment framework, ensuring that the engineering teams could prioritize the tasks with timelines and specific milestones for isolating and measuring the fabric macros' power consumption.\n\nFrom a bug analysis perspective, o1-preview not only responded to the immediate needs of the bug report but also demonstrated a deeper understanding of the challenges posed by such tasks in real-world chip development. Its response took into account both the technical and strategic dimensions of the issue, offering a more valuable solution for engineers tasked with optimizing chip power consumption. By anticipating potential challenges and offering concrete suggestions on data analysis and task delegation, o1-preview demonstrated superior problem-solving capabilities compared to ChipNeMo.\n\nIn conclusion, across the three critical tasks-Engineering Assistant Chatbot, EDA Script Generation, and Bug Summary & Analysis-o1-preview consistently demonstrated superior problem-solving capabilities, depth of analysis, and practical relevance compared to ChipNeMo. In the Engineering Assistant Chatbot task, o1-preview excelled by offering more comprehensive solutions, anticipating edge cases, and providing optimization insights that reflected real-world engineering challenges.\n\nIn EDA Script Generation, o1-preview again showed a greater understanding of scalability and flexibility, delivering solutions that could be adapted to complex, large-scale designs. Its ability to optimize code and handle intricate netlist structures demonstrated advanced reasoning that would be invaluable to engineers working on chip automation tasks. Finally, in Bug Summary & Analysis, o1-preview's thorough analysis and strategic foresight allowed it to offer not just a summary of the bug but also suggestions for power optimization and task prioritization. This comprehensive approach underscores o1-preview's capacity to engage with both the technical and managerial aspects of chip design, making it a powerful tool in handling complex semiconductor development tasks. Ultimately, o1-preview's consistent performance highlights its potential to play a pivotal role in advancing chip design automation and enhancing engineering workflows.",

      "text": "o1-preview has demonstrated powerful capabilities in the tests of logical reasoning problems. It has abundant knowledge related to logical reasoning. Judging from the test results, whether it is a regular logical reasoning question or a complex logical reasoning problem with a certain degree of difficulty, such as those involving multi -level nested reasoning or multi -condition comprehensive judgment, it can provide very accurate and well -organized analysis processes and answers, and its analysis ability is extremely outstanding.\n\nIn the process of in-depth research and testing on the reasoning ability of o1-preview, we have discovered a noteworthy phenomenon. The reasoning of o1-preview cannot be completely mapped accurately to the given standard answer. This implies that in some specific problem scenarios, o1-preview may not be able to provide results that are entirely consistent with the traditional standard answers, such as those in  Figures 28, 107, 110, 111, 112 . However, despite this shortcoming, the thinking process demonstrated by o1-preview is astonishing. When confronted with various complex reasoning tasks, o1-preview can rapidly analyze and break down problems. It will attempt to examine problems from different angles, just like a perceptive thinker exploring unknown realms. Whether dealing with logical puzzles, making situational inferences, or analyzing complex relationship networks, o1-preview can display its unique way of thinking.For instance, when facing a complex logical reasoning problem, o1-preview may not directly give the conclusion in the standard answer. Instead, it will analyze each element of the problem step by step and propose some novel thinking paths and possibilities. This exploratory thinking process provides us with a new perspective and prompts us to re-examine the essence and solution methods of problems.\n\nIt can analyze complex problems, break them down into smaller components, and systematically work through them to arrive at accurate conclusions. Whether it's solving mathematical puzzles, deducing the next step in a sequence, or evaluating the validity of an argument,o1-preview demonstrates a high level of intelligence and precision. See  Figures 27, 105, 106, 108, 109 . Its ability to handle multiple variables and conditions simultaneously is particularly impressive. It can consider different scenarios, weigh the pros and cons of each option, and make informed decisions. This not only showcases its logical acumen but also its adaptability to various types of problems.\n\nThe thinking process of o1-preview also reflects its strong learning and adaptability. Although it may deviate from the standard answer on some problems, by continuously receiving new data and feedback, o1-preview can gradually optimize its reasoning model and continuously approach the correct answer. This continuous improvement ability brings great potential for its future applications. It can present its thought process in a way that is easy to understand, making it a valuable tool for education, research, and problem-solving in various fields. However, although its error rate is relatively low, there are still some cases of mistakes. For example, on some problems that require the exploration of very subtle logical relationships, it may occasionally have deviations in reasoning. For most logical reasoning tests, only the basic information of the problem needs to be provided without particularly detailed guidance, and o1-preview can successfully complete the reasoning analysis. Moreover, it can quickly process a large number of different types of logical reasoning problems. Nevertheless, when facing extremely complex problems involving the intersection of multiple different logical systems, o1-preview may encounter bottlenecks. This is a limitation of o1-preview in handling complex logical reasoning tasks.\n\nWhat we would like to point out is that the official standard answer is not necessarily accurate. Instead, the analysis and reasoning process offered by o1-preview is truly convincing. From our perspective, this is far more gratifying than relying on the standard answer.",

Conifers have a small area, and the adsorption effect of PM2.5 is weak. On average throughout the year, broadleaf trees are much better at vacuuming than conifers. Broad-leaved trees are also much better than shrubs and grasses in vacuuming effect. Taking the Chinese sophora, a common broad-leaved tree in Beijing, as an example, the vacuuming effect of the Chinese sophora tree is about 30% higher than that of the common grassland of the same area. According to this, some people believe that in order to reduce dust, Beijing should vigorously promote broadleaf trees and minimize the area of coniferous forests. Which of the following, if true, would most undermine the views of those concerned?\n\nA. Although conifers do not shed leaves in winter, they are basically in A \"dormant\" state and have poor biological activity. B. The proportion of broadleaf trees and conifers is unbalanced, which is not only easy to break out diseases, pests, fires, etc., but also affects the growth and health of trees. C. Plant afforestation not only needs to control PM2.5, but also needs to control other pollutants, which needs to be rationally distributed.

To undermine this view, we need to introduce information that challenges the effectiveness or practicality of this recommendation.\n\nOption A mentions that conifers are dormant in winter and have poor biological activity. This doesn't undermine the recommendation because it aligns with the argument that conifers are less effective than broadleaf trees in dust removal.\n\nOption D states that broadleaf trees have higher maintenance costs in winter due to shedding leaves. While this suggests a downside to broadleaf trees, it doesn't necessarily outweigh their dust removal benefits nor directly challenge the conclusion.\n\nOption C suggests that afforestation needs to address pollutants other than PM2.5 and requires rational distribution. This implies a need for varied plant types but doesn't directly refute the superiority of broadleaf trees in dust removal. Option B, however, introduces significant drawbacks to minimizing coniferous forests and over-promoting broadleaf trees. It states that an imbalance in the proportion of broadleaf trees and conifers can lead to increased risks of diseases, pests, fires, and negatively affect tree health. This directly undermines the recommendation by highlighting serious ecological and environmental risks associated with reducing coniferous forests, suggesting that a balanced mix of tree species is necessary for a healthy ecosystem. **Answer: Option B**",

Its ability to interpret and present complex clinical data-such as patient demographics, cognitive scores, and imaging biomarkers-has proven both reliable and precise, offering valuable insights for medical research and reporting. The model's output not only captures the nuances of the data but also maintains the integrity of the clinical information, making it a promising tool for enhancing data-driven storytelling in healthcare. Based on the experimental results, the model provides well-organized and accurate analyses, demonstrating exceptional capabilities in summarizing and interpreting clinical data.\n\nDuring our in-depth testing of o1-preview's table-to-text abilities, we observed an intriguing phenomenon. In cases where certain clinical measurements, such as a patient's data, were marked as \"NaN\" (Not a Number), o1-preview didn't simply output this label.

The o1-preview demonstrated outstanding performance, achieving 100% accuracy across all 10 test cases. This consistent performance on problems of varying difficulty demonstrates its ability to handle both simple and more advanced mathematics problems. Beyond just providing correct final answers, the o1-preview's solutions have also demonstrated detailed, step-by-step explanations which include the key steps found in the reference solutions. This level of detailed solutions suggest that the model is approaching a human-like capability in logical reasoning within the domain of mathematics.\n\nIn case 1 (Figure  31 ), a level 5 algebra problem was presented, asking the model to determine the maximum difference between the radii of two circles given a constraint on the difference in their areas. The problem involved both geometric and algebraic reasoning, as the model needed to consider the difference of squares in the area equation and apply the given constraints to determine the maximum difference between the length of the radii. The o1-preview accurately identified the essential steps of utilizing the area difference formula and solving the inequality, eventually reaching the final answer of 0.5. The solution was detailed and the key steps aligned with the reference answer, highlighting the model's capability to handle complex geometric problems with logical steps.\n\nIn case 2 (Figure  32 ), the problem involved calculating the positive difference between 120% of 30 and 130% of 20. Although this was only a level 1 algebra problem involving basic percentage calculations, it could still display the o1-preview's logical approach if it could clearly present the essential steps.

Case 3 (Figure  33 ) presented a combinatorial problem involving the principle of counting and probability to determine how many students at a school played on exactly two sports teams. The o1-preview adeptly handled this problem by first defining variables for each team and calculating the team sizes using the given ratios. The o1-preview then applied the inclusion-exclusion principle to account for the overlaps between teams, particularly focusing on the number of students playing on exactly two teams. The final solution of the o1-preview matched the reference answer of 14 and the o1-preview's solution demonstrated its capability in handling the counting problems, such as overcounting and managing complex combinatorial reasoning tasks.\n\nIn case 4 (Figure  34 ), the o1-preview was asked to solve a algebraic problem that involved determining how many non-congruent isosceles triangles exist with integer side lengths and a perimeter of 10. The problem required the use of the triangle inequality theorem to validate potential side lengths while ensuring that no two triangles were congruent. The o1-preview systematically considered all possible combinations of side lengths, verified each combination using the triangle inequality, and correctly identified that two such triangles satisfied the conditions. The key steps in o1-preview's solution mirrored those in the reference answer, with the green-highlighted final answer and yellow-highlighted steps indicating the shared reasoning between the model's solution and the reference. This case further illustrates the o1-preview's strength in handling algebraic and combinatorial problems, showcasing its ability to systematically integrate algebraic and geometric reasoning.\n\nAnother notable observation is the speed at which the o1-preview generated solutions. For most cases, the model produced correct answers in just a few seconds, reflecting its efficiency in processing and reasoning. This instant response time is promising for real-time applications in mathematical problem-solving. However, for some of the more challenging level 5 problems, the o1-preview took up to 50 seconds to generate solutions. This prolonged thinking time may indicate that the o1-preview is engaging in more intricate reasoning, similar to how humans approach difficult problems. While this observation suggests the model may exhibit human-like thought processes under higher difficulty, further investigation is necessary to draw definitive conclusions about its human-like thinking process in these scenarios.",

      "text": "To evaluate o1-preview's ability to solve college-level math problems, we presented the model with 12 manually chosen problems. These problems cover topics including discrete math, Calculus and proofs of advanced math theorems. The answers generated by the o1-preview model were manually evaluated by the authors and categorized as correct, questionable, or incorrect. Due to complexity of the problems, we do not provide reference answers in our Figures. The test results are summarized in Table  5 . Now, we provide a detailed analysis of each problem and the answer generated by o1-preview. In particular, we provide in-depth analysis for each of the questionable or incorrect answers.\n\nQuestion 1 (Figure  35 ) and 2 (Figure  119 ) are basic discrete math problems from the field of Combinatorics. Both are presented as counting problems involving variables, asking for explicit formulas expressed in terms of those variables. o1-preview solved these successfully, indicating that the model can understand basic discrete patterns and perform symbolic computation effectively.\n\nQuestion 3 (Figure  120 ), 4 (Figure  121 ), 5 (Figure  36 ) are advanced discrete math problems from the field of elementary number theory. The model struggled the most with this set of problems, failing to solve all three.\n\nTo take a closer look into these problems, Question 3 involves proving an identity about two sequences {a i } n i=1 and {b i } n i=1 of positive integers provided that they satisfy certain conditions. During test time, after first noticing some easy identities satisfied by the sequences, the model introduced a creative step (highlighted in yellow in Figure  120 ), proposing that if a specific relation between a i and b i for each i could be proved, then the problem would be easily solved. This suggestion is incorrect in the first place, as the suggested relation is not true in general. What is more concerning is the model's subsequent steps to follow through on its own suggestion. Instead of proving that the relation holds universally for any valid sequences {a i } n i=1 and {b i } n i=1 , the model constructed a specific pair of sequences that satisfies the relation (also highlighted in yellow). For this particular pair, the required identity trivially holds. The model then erroneously generalized from this specific case, concluding that the relation must hold in all cases (highlighted in red) and, therefore, claiming to have proven the identity. This approach clearly violates logical principles, as a single example cannot be used to prove a general statement. This error, known as \"proof by example\", which is a type of inappropriate generalization, indicates a gap in the model's reasoning abilities: while the model may generate creative insights, it lacks the rigor required to validate general claims through proper logical reasoning and proof construction. The experiment was repeated a few more times, but the o1-preview model was not able to generate a correct solution.\n\nwhen concatenated into a single integer, the resulting number is divisible by 7. One example (n = 2) is included in the prompt to help the model understand the question. Initially, the model proposed several ideas, none of which were particularly useful for solving the problem. It eventually resorted to using the pigeonhole principle. This approach was incorrect, as counterexamples can easily be constructed. The authors followed up by highlighting this mistake and providing counterexamples. Although the model acknowledged its mistakes, it ultimately responded that it was unable to solve the problem.\n\nQuestion 5 is the famous Problem 6 from the 1988 International Mathematical Olympiad (IMO), which requires showing that whenever an integer n can be written in a specific form, it must be a perfect square (i.e. n = k 2 for some k). Given the popularity of this problem, the authors initially expected the model to solve it with ease, but it did not. The model did demonstrate some insight by recognizing that proving the discriminant of specific quadratic is a perfect square would solve the problem. In the subsequent steps, however, the model claimed to observe a pattern by testing small integer values. However, misled by specific test values, the model committed another case of inappropriate generalization, assuming that the observed pattern holds in general. Moreover, this observed pattern is of the form \"n = b 2 \", which overlaps with what it was asked to prove (highlighted in red in Figure  36 ). This constitutes \"circular reasoning\", where the model's assumption essentially repeats the problem's conclusion. After a few more attempts, the model kept making similar mistakes and was unable to generate a correct proof. These logical flaws suggest that while the o1-preview model can identify patterns from small examples, it is prone to being misled and making inappropriate generalizations. Additionally, in cases requiring longer reasoning chains, the model may lose track of its initial assumptions and fall into circular reasoning. Question 6 (Figure  122 ) and 7 (Figure  37 ) are advanced Calculus problems. o1-preview performed reasonably well on both. Specifically, Question 6 requires proving a bound for a continuously differentiable function defined on [0, 1]. Solving this problem requires applying the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus and the Cauchy-Schwartz inequality. The model solved it correctly and efficiently, suggesting that it possesses adequate knowledge of classical theorems and is able to apply them when the clues are obvious. Question 7 involves testing the convergence of an infinite series. Since such problems are classical and many examples are available on the internet, the prompt specifically asked for two different methods to ensure that the model would not rely on a memorized solution. The model provided two methods, but neither was completely satisfactory. The first method was simply incorrect. The model attempted to compare the given series to a specific subseries of the harmonic series ∞ n=1 1 n , concluding the divergence of the given series based on the divergence of the harmonic series (highlighted in red in Figure  37 ). This reasoning is flawed, as a subseries of a divergent series can still converge. The second method, while correct, relied on advanced techniques from graduate-level Real Analysis (highlighted in yellow). Given the overall inadequacy of the answers, particularly the incorrect first method and the overly advanced second method, we deemed the model's responses to be questionable.\n\nThe last five problems are all advanced theorem proof problems. Question 8 (Figure  123 ) and 8.5 (Figure  124 ) come from the field of Real Analysis, with Question 8.5 being a follow-up to Question 8. Both involve verifying certain topological properties of infinite dimensional spaces. The model successfully solved both problems. Question 9 (Figure  125 ), which was picked from a textbook on Functional Analysis  [67] , proved to be challenging to the model. o1-preview failed to solve it particularly due to a misunderstanding of 100 linear independence in the context of infinite dimensional spaces. Question 10 (Figure  126 ) and 10.5 (Figure  127 ) are on Hilbert's Nullstellensatz, one of the most famous theorems from the field of Algebraic Geometry. The two questions are essentially the same, but each allows the model to assume a different intermediate result. This design ensures that the model pursues distinct approaches, rather than relying on a memorized solution. The model performed well on both questions, providing two different proofs that align with their respective intermediate results.\n\nTo close this subsection, we provide a summary of the strengths and limitations of o1-preview on college-level mathematical reasoning tasks.\n\nRegarding the strengths, we have empirically observed that:\n\n• Overall, o1-preview possesses comprehensive knowledge of college-level mathematical terminologies and classical theorems. Even when problems involve advanced concepts like the function space C[0, 1] or topological interior and closure, the model had no difficulty understanding the problem statements. Moreover, when the problem can be solved by directly applying one or two theorems, no matter how advanced they are, the model can effectively identify and apply the appropriate theorems. This in particular applies to Question 6, Question 7 (second method), Question 8, and Question 10 and 10.5.\n\n• o1-preview shows a spark of creative reasoning ability, which involves making insightful observations, and sometimes constructing small examples to aid observation-making, as in Question 3 and Question 5. However, this ability seems to be in its early stages and is incomplete.\n\n• Some of the mistakes made by the o1-preview model are remarkably human-like. Unlike earlier models, such as GPT-4o, whose incorrect responses were often vague, repetitive, and filled with irrelevant details, the errors made by the new model are more relatable and understandable.\n\nIn fact, the types of mistakes resemble those a college student might make, particularly in Question 4, Question 7 (first method), and Question 9. For comparison purposes, the response to Question 7 generated by GPT-4o is illustrated in Figure  38 . Note the repetition as highlighted in yellow, and two occurrences vague reasoning as highlighted in red.\n\nFor the limitations, our empirical observations indicate that:\n\n• While o1-preview demonstrates the ability to make insightful observations and identify patterns from examples it constructs, it can also be misled by its own observations, leading to inappropriate generalizations-mistakenly assuming that coincidences apply more broadly. This applies to Question 3 and Question 5. In general, there is no evidence to support that the model possesses a genuine understanding of logical principles. When faced with extended reasoning chains, where it may even fall into circular reasoning.\n\n• It seems the o1-preview model lacks an awareness of problem difficulty and often prioritizes efficiency over appropriateness. For instance, in Question 7, it applied overly advanced techniques to solve a moderately challenging problem.\n\n• Overall, the model tends to perform better on problems with a high level of abstraction that require advanced theorems but involve shorter reasoning chains, such as the last five problems, rather than on problems with straightforward statements that require less advanced knowledge but involve much longer reasoning processes, such as the three advanced discrete math problems.",

While the model performs exceptionally well with shorter, more concise texts (Figure  40 , Figure  41 , Figure  42 ), challenges persist when dealing with longer and more complex records, which may impact its accuracy (Figure  39 ). Nevertheless, the model's ability to offer reasoning and diagnostic justifications indicates that with future fine-tuning, particularly through reinforcement learning tailored to EHR data, its diagnostic capabilities could be significantly enhanced. Additional examples can be found in (Appendix A.11).\n\nOverall, the o1-preview's capabilities to understand and analyze EHRs show great potential for the development of AI-driven healthcare tools, though further refinement is needed to improve its effectiveness in real-world medical applications.",

These prompts were structured from broad to detailed, allowing us to gauge the model's performance across different levels of granularity. The first, the coarse prompt, provides minimal guidance, simply directing the model to identify private information without offering further specifics. The medium prompt introduces a more comprehensive list of privacy-related elements, while the fine prompt supplies detailed instructions, specifying the properties of each privacy feature. Table  6  outlines this experiment's complete set of prompts. What are the phone numbers? Replace the matching characters with [redacted]:\n\nPlease anonymize the following clinical note. Specifically, replace all the following information with the term \"[redacted]\": redact any strings that might be a name or acronym or initials, redact any strings separated by the \\ / symbol, redact patients' names, doctors' names and the strings in front of M.D. or after Dr., redact pager names and medical staff names, redact any strings that look like something years old or age 37, redact any dates and IDs and numbers and record dates, redact locations and addresses and clinic names, redact professions and ages and contacts, redact any acronyms and initials.:\n\nAs the results (Figures  45, 46, 47)  present, o1-preview is capable of detecting nearly all sensitive information, even when processing lengthy content. It can efficiently handle long texts, analyze the material from multiple perspectives, and generate results in a short amount of time. Although different words are redacted across the three prompts, each effectively removed essential privacy information, demonstrating the impressive general capabilities of o1-preview. The results have proved its potential to be a powerful automatic tool to anonymize professional medical texts. o1-preview accurately detects personal names and timestamps, but slight variations can be observed when using different prompts. With implicit prompts, o1-preview focuses primarily on the overall structure of the content, identifying sensitive information in fixed positions while preserving abbreviations that aid in localization. For general prompts, due to the strong alignment between the annotation features and the prompts, o1-preview detects all sensitive information without any additional effort. However, with explicit prompts, the abundance of instructions causes the o1preview to evaluate each word individually. While it successfully identifies all sensitive information, it occasionally removes more meaningful words than expected.

      "text": "To evaluate the capabilities of o1-preview in social media analysis, we used four common tweet datasets and reported results across 11 cases. The prompt templates used throughout the testing process are presented in Table  7 . Among these 11 cases, three cases are sentiment analysis (Figure  48 ), two cases are offensive language detection (Figure  49 ), four are emotion recognition(Figure  144 ), and two are irony identification (Figure  145 ). During the reasoning tests, we found that o1-preview performed very well in most cases, with its predictions aligning closely with the ground truth. However, there were some instances where it produced incorrect results. For example, such errors were observed in both sentiment analysis and emotion recognition tasks. In the case of sentiment analysis, o1-preview mistakenly judged a tweet with neutral sentiment as containing negative sentiment. When performing sentiment analysis on this example, o1-preview output was: I'm mapping out the sentiment expressed in the text, where it condemns a massacre and bombings, and advocates action for Aleppo, indicating both negative and positive sentiments. Although o1-preview ultimately gave the wrong answer, it was actually unsure during its reasoning whether the text had more positive or negative sentiments. Despite this uncertainty, it did not choose the neutral option that lies between positive and negative sentiments. Similarly, this phenomenon was also observed in another error case on the emotion recognition task.\n\nAlthough our test results are not comprehensive due to OpenAI's policy restrictions, we have roughly summarized some reasons that may cause o1-preview to analyze incorrect results in some cases. First, these tasks require deep semantic understanding and the ability to interpret subtle emotional cues, such as sarcasm or tone, which models may struggle to capture accurately. emotions often rely on implicit context, cultural background, or even non-verbal cues, which are difficult for text-based models to grasp. This suggests that while large language models excel in many areas, they still face significant limitations when it comes to understanding and interpreting human emotions. Overall, the performance results of o1-preview on social media analysis tasks are positive. It captures complex expressions such as irony, sarcasm, and humor on most tasks.",

The presence of dropstones or erratics with low roundness and angular shapes embedded in finegrained marine sedimentary rocks like mudstone is explained by glacial transport and ice-rafted debris (IRD) deposition. Here's how the process works: 1. Glacial Erosion and Transport: Glaciers move across the land, eroding the underlying rock and picking up a range of debris, from fine sediments to large boulders. This material becomes entrained within the ice. 2. Calving and Iceberg Formation: When glaciers reach the sea, chunks of ice break off in a process called calving, forming icebergs that float in the ocean. These icebergs carry the embedded rocks and sediments with them. 3. Ice-Rafted Debris Deposition: As icebergs drift away from their source, they gradually melt due to warmer ocean temperatures. When the ice melts sufficiently, the entrained debris is released and drops to the ocean floor. This material can range from tiny grains to large, angular boulders. 4.Sedimentation in Marine Environments: The ocean floor, especially in calm marine settings, is often accumulating finegrained sediments like mud and clay. When the larger rocks from melting icebergs settle through the water column, they become embedded in these finer sediments. 5.Formation of Dropstones: Over time, the accumulation of sediments buries these rocks, and they become part of the sedimentary record. In the resulting sedimentary rock layers, these larger clasts appear \"suspended\" within the finer matrix, creating what geologists refer to as dropstones.",

Our goal is to evaluate the performance of the o1-preview in addressing key concepts in a relatively narrow domain from both theoretical and practical perspectives, including test score reliability, standard error of measurement, and interrater reliability. Each prompt was designed to test the o1-preview's efficacy in providing concrete explanations, applying appropriate statistical techniques, and offering solutions that align with established psychometric frameworks. The following sections provide detailed descriptions of all testing scenarios: For the first task in Figure  61 , which involved calculating a reliability coefficient using the Spearman-Brown Prophecy formula, o1-preview demonstrated impressive accuracy. The model not only applied the correct formula but also provided a detailed explanation of each step, making the process informative and easy to follow. This suggests that o1-preview is proficient in handling statistical calculations related to test reliability, which is an important area of educational psychometrics. Its ability to calculate and articulate the reasoning behind the steps reflects a strong understanding of this foundational area in the field.\n\nIn the second task in Figure  62 , which assessed o1-preview understanding of the standard error of measurement and confidence intervals, the model once again delivered a solid response. It accurately calculated the correct range of scores, demonstrating its capability to identify and apply measurement concepts to real-world test scenarios. This further highlights o1-preview's ability to provide reliable and informed outputs in educational measurement tasks. However, o1-preview's performance in the third task in Figure  63  exposed some limitations in disentangling similar concepts. The third task aims to solve a multiple choice question inculding more than one correct response that evaluates understanding concepts of interrater agreement and interrater reliability, which are two close concepts that measure the consistency of multiple raters' ratings on a performance assessment (e.g., an essay). The model incorrectly identified nominal agreement and Cohen's kappa as measures of interrater reliability, when the appropriate measures should have been Intraclass Correlation (ICC) and Coefficient Alpha. However, the o1-preview offered the correct definition of the four measures together with the practical application scenarios. This response showcases o1-preview's lack of understanding of the connections between key concepts when the potential training set provides limited information.\n\nIn sum, the o1-preview excelled in tasks requiring statistical computation and reasoning, demonstrating a solid grasp of standard psychometric concepts that are equivalent to or beyond a first-year master's or doctoral student's level in educational measurement and psychometrics. However, our tests revealed some weaknesses in its ability to distinguish closely related concepts even under simple questions.",

For example, in 64 Case 1, the model successfully identified the overall trend but overlooked specifics, such as the increased listings for heart and lung transplants. In 64 Case 2, it provided precise insights into increased coverage and access to care, closely matching the reference answer.\n\nHowever, the o1-preview model occasionally lacked depth in addressing specific topics, as shown in  65 , where key disease-specific examples were omitted. This limitation reduced its ability to capture the nuances of the ACA's effects entirely on certain populations. This suggests that the model requires further refinement, especially in areas demanding advanced analysis and detailed specificity.\n\nIn this domain, o1-preview performed robustly in analyzing the Affordable Care Act and its broader public health impacts. The model effectively highlighted significant elements of health policy, such as Medicaid expansion, preventive services, and efforts to address healthcare disparities. Despite some limitations in providing detailed explanations, its reasoning aligned well with the ground truth across most cases.\n\nFor future evaluations, we could consider using larger datasets, such as the Compilation of State Data on the Affordable Care Act  [44] , which would allow for more thorough training and testing of o1-preview's abilities. Additionally, incorporating more evaluation metrics, along with broader perspectives on policy evaluation, would offer a more comprehensive assessment of the model's public health policy analysis capabilities.\n\nWith further improvements in providing more specific examples and advanced analysis, o1-preview will exhibit significant potential for excelling in public health policy analysis and policy-making tasks.",

These questions focused on relationship predictions and their corresponding explanations. The tasks aimed to assess different facets of genomics reasoning and utilized selected QA tasks from the GenTurning benchmarks  [52] . In all the tested 20 QA instances, o1-preview yields correct answers. Considering the related information we provided in the prompt, the o1-preview has the ability to generate reliable conclusions by following a correct chain-of-though which is derived from the truth. On observing the details of the reasoning steps, the o1-preview provided explanations for all aspects and showed clearly how it came to the conclusions. We show a true-positive case in (Figure  66 ) and a false-negative case in (Figure  67 ), which in both cases, o1-preview shows satisfactory results. In the view of inference time consumption, it is observed that for the negative terms, the o1-preview takes a significantly longer time to draw the conclusion. In our test, the average running time of a true-positive conclusion is 12.67s, while the average running time of a false-negative conclusion is 20.09s. Based on this observation, it is reasonable to speculate that the o1-preview takes a longer chain-of-though in attempting to reject a genomics hypothesis. Additional examples can be found in (Appendix A.18).",

The test aims to evaluate whether the model can select the correct options for medical knowledge questions and give reasonable explanations.\n\no1-preview demonstrated alignment with the reference answer. Upon selecting the correct option, it provided a reasonable explanation of the underlying knowledge, suggesting that the model comprehends the question's content and identifies the key elements required to solve the problem. For instance, in Figure  68 , when confronted with a relatively simple knowledge-based question, the model chose the correct option and provided a coherent explanation of the functions and effects of several fatty acids. Likewise, in Figure  69  , when addressing a more complex scenario-based inference question, o1-preview selected the correct answer and offered common symptoms and explanations for four diseases, expanding upon the question's scope. The explanation for the correct answer, Von Gierke disease, closely matched the standard answer explanation.\n\nHowever, the model occasionally overlooks key information when dealing with specific topics, resulting in a lack of necessary logical judgment. Even when choosing the correct option, the model may miss key conditions when evaluating the wrong option. For example, in Figure  163 , it ignores the fact that \"autosomal recessive polycystic kidney disease\" cannot occur in a \"28-year-old male,\" indicating an inability to use logical thinking to process multiple pieces of information in parallel. Despite these minor flaws, o1-preview demonstrates strong reasoning capabilities, especially when answering questions using large medical knowledge datasets.\n\nIn summary, o1-preview performs well in medical knowledge question answering. The model effectively captures the key information in the questions and can provide accurate options and effective explanations through retrieval. Although some explanations exhibit illogical reasoning and information gaps, in most cases, the overall reasoning is consistent with the facts. In the current test, the model achieved 100% accuracy. With further refinements, such as offering more specific examples and conducting deeper analyses, o1-preview shows great potential for medical knowledge question answering tasks.",

Although six diverse tasks were tested, detailed explanations are presented for these two key example tasks-explaining the concept of currere in education  [135]  and designing a cardboard assemblage art activity for children  [110] -to assess the model's ability to engage with both theoretical educational frameworks and practical curriculum design. The analysis concentrated on creativity, practical application, and depth of theoretical understanding.\n\nIn the task requiring an explanation of currere in education, o1-preview provided a well-organized and thoughtful response. It accurately described the four phases of currere-regressive, progressive, analytical, and synthetic-and elaborated on how these stages enable individuals to reflect on their educational experiences. The model emphasized the importance of personal reflection, memory, and synthesizing past and future learning experiences, closely aligning with William Pinar's original work on currere  [135] . This explanation showcased o1-preview's capacity to engage with theoretical concepts and communicate their educational relevance clearly. As illustrated in Figure  70 .\n\nWhen tasked with designing a cardboard assemblage art activity, o1-preview demonstrated strong capabilities in creating a structured, step-by-step curriculum. It suggested a variety of materials, offered instructions that encouraged creativity and collaboration, and outlined clear learning objectives. However, when compared to Dr. Penfold's approach-Harvard University's Art Education Coordinator-o1-preview's lesson appeared more rigid and structured, lacking the flexibility and adaptive scaffolding essential for fostering children's open-ended exploration. Dr. Penfold emphasizes allowing children to freely explore materials, introducing techniques when appropriate to encourage spontaneity and imaginative problem-solving, both of which are essential to child-centered art education  [110] . The more standardized curriculum model proposed by o1-preview highlights a gap between its procedural creativity and the responsive, individualized approach that human educators like Dr. Penfold implement. As illustrated in Figure  71 .\n\nIn conclusion, while o1-preview excels in both practical curriculum planning and theoretical explanation, it lacks the depth of emotional insight and contextual sensitivity that human educators bring to art education. The model's versatility in handling both practical and theoretical aspects is evident, yet it falls short in adapting to children's varying needs in real-time and fostering the kind of open-ended exploration advocated by educators like Dr. Penfold. This highlights a key difference between AI models and human educators-o1-preview can be a valuable tool for generating ideas and structuring content, but human educators are essential for creating flexible, responsive learning environments that nurture children's creativity in a more personal and adaptive manner.",

The aim is not just to accumulate knowledge but to understand oneself and the world more profoundly, using academic study as a vehicle for personal and social transformation.\n\nThis approach critiques the rigid, outcomes-based model of education, arguing that true learning must involve subjective, intellectual engagement with the curriculum, allowing individuals to explore their identities and their roles in society.

This test aims to evaluate whether the o1-preview model can summarize the textual content with the ability of context relevance, text content understanding and text generation. We compare the summary of the o1-preview with the manual summary for the corresponding article from three perspectives: accuracy, degree of abstraction and length.\n\nSummaries generated by o1-preview show high similarity with a reference summary and original content in some samples, although they have different expressions with the same meaning. For instance, in Figure  72 , the summary of both human beings and o1-preview has the same theme, which is \"a type of fasting diet can regenerate pancreas cells\".\n\nHowever, the o1-preview model tends to generate more detail, compared with manually summarizing. Human beings seem to be better at and more accustomed to a higher level of abstraction of text. For instance, in Figure  73 , although both of the two summaries describe \"Tiger Woods missed the cut at the Farmers Insurance Open\". Human beings tend to show the reason in a processed expression, which does not directly show the scores of the competition but shows a calculated and more abstractive result, while the o1-preview model lists several details about the competition. This kind of difference is shown not only in a single sample, this is common sense. In Figure  169 , o1-preview model generated too much details so that the summary is not as easy to read as manual summary.\n\nAs for the length, summaries of o1-preview are longer than those of human beings in most samples. This is because summaries of o1-preview contain more details than manual summaries.\n\nIn summary, the o1-preview model is well performed in content summarization tasks. It can meet the basic needs of most summarization tasks, but compared with human summaries, it usually contains more details and is slightly inferior to humans in the ability to abstract information.",

The quality and practicality of these outputs varied, suggesting a need for better grounding in real-world constraints and domain-specific knowledge.\n\nFuture research directions should focus on:\n\n• Enhancing the model's efficiency in complex problem-solving under time constraints.\n\n• Improving performance in advanced mathematical reasoning and abstract concept manipulation.\n\n• Developing better mechanisms for concise and relevant information extraction and presentation.\n\n• Expanding capabilities in low-resource languages and improving cross-lingual generalization.\n\n• Refining domain-specific knowledge integration, particularly in specialized fields such as medicine, engineering and other sciences that require domain expertise  [92, 70, 173, 106, 49, 172, 38, 152, 208, 37, 107, 100, 198, 163, 216, 194, 151, 50, 162, 28, 105, 16] .\n\n• Improving the model's ability to handle multi-step reasoning tasks consistently across various domains, including sciences, engineering, medicine, public health, pharmacy, arts, humanities, education, agriculture, business, law, politics, and social studies. These domains can benefit from models that can reason well  [92, 217, 113, 21, 105, 97, 209, 20, 51, 89, 88, 185, 102, 150, 103, 104, 183, 109, 99, 82] .",

      "text": "Large language model agents are designed to handle complex tasks requiring sequential reasoning, planning, and memory. These agents typically consist of four key components: a core language model (the \"brain\"), a planning mechanism, memory systems, and the ability to use external tools  [186] . By integrating these elements, LLM agents can break down complex problems, formulate strategies, and adapt their approaches based on feedback and new information.\n\no1 potentially changes the application potential of LLM agents. The combination of LLM agents with o1-preview's advanced capabilities presents exciting possibilities for tackling intricate science and engineering challenges. o1-preview has already demonstrated remarkable proficiency across various domains, from coding and mathematical reasoning to scientific analysis and creative problem-solving.\n\nWhen enhanced with the structured approach of LLM agents, o1 could potentially address even more complex, multi-step problems in scientific research and engineering design.\n\nFor instance, in scientific research, an o1-powered LLM agent could systematically approach experimental design by breaking down the process into subtasks such as literature review, hypothesis formation, methodology planning, and data analysis strategy. The agent's planning capabilities could help in outlining long-term research projects, while its memory systems could maintain coherence across extended investigations, recalling relevant past experiments or related findings. In engineering, such an agent could assist in complex system design by managing interconnected components, predicting potential issues, and suggesting optimizations. The tool use capability of LLM agents could allow o1 to interface with specialized engineering software, running simulations or accessing specific databases as needed during the design process.\n\nMoreover, the self-reflection and improvement capabilities of LLM agents could enhance o1's already impressive reasoning skills, allowing for continuous refinement of solutions in iterative design processes or long-term research projects. This could be particularly valuable in fields like materials science or drug discovery, where vast parameter spaces need to be explored systematically.\n\nHowever, it's important to note that challenges remain. The current limitations of LLM agents, such as context constraints and difficulties with long-term planning, would need to be addressed. Additionally, ensuring the reliability and consistency of outputs in critical scientific and engineering applications would be paramount.",

      "text": "Result: Mean reversion and momentum are two fundamental concepts in quantitative finance that, at first glance, may seem contradictory. Mean reversion suggests that asset prices and returns tend to move back toward their historical averages over time. In contrast, momentum trading strategies capitalize on the continuation of existing trends, assuming that assets performing well will continue to do so in the near future.\n\nUnderstanding the relationship between these two concepts is crucial for developing effective quantitative momentum trading strategies that can adapt to changing market conditions. Mean Reversion in Finance •Definition:\n\n• Mean reversion is the financial theory suggesting that asset prices and returns eventually revert to their long-term mean or average level. • This mean can be the historical average price, average return, or another statistical benchmark.\n\n•Mechanism:\n\n• Overreaction and Correction: Markets may overreact to news, causing prices to deviate from intrinsic values. Over time, prices correct themselves. • Statistical Properties: In a mean-reverting process, extreme values are followed by movements back toward the mean.\n\n•Applications:\n\n• Identifying Overbought/Oversold Conditions: Traders use indicators like the Relative Strength Index (RSI) to spot potential reversals.\n\n• Pairs Trading: Involves taking positions on two correlated assets that have diverged from their typical price relationship.",

The key to understanding which option best fits this recommendation lies in examining how changing thread balls impacts labor costs under different wage systems.\n\nOption B states: \"The factory operates on an hourly wage system, not a piecework wage system.\"\n\nIn an hourly wage system, workers are paid based on the time they spend working, regardless of how much they produce. Frequent stops to change thread balls mean workers spend part of their paid time not producing garments, which increases labor costs per unit of output. By using larger thread balls, the factory reduces nonproductive downtime, making workers more efficient during their paid hours, and thus reducing labor costs.\n\nIn contrast, under a piecework wage system, workers are paid based on the number of items they produce. Downtime caused by changing thread balls would primarily affect workers' earnings, not the factory's labor costs per unit. Therefore, the recommendation to reduce stops would not have the same impact on labor costs in a piecework system.\n\nOptions A, C, and D are less directly related to the labor cost implications of changing thread balls. Option A introduces a potential quality issue with large thread balls but doesn't address labor costs. Option C is about machine maintenance, which is separate from the frequency of changing thread balls. Option D discusses operator movement policies but doesn't directly relate to labor cost savings from reduced downtime. **Answer:** B.

Below is a summary of the key findings from various studies and analyses up to October 2023. Increased Insurance Coverage •Evidence: Kaiser Family Foundation (KFF): Reports have consistently shown that states opting for Medicaid expansion experienced substantial increases in Medicaid enrollment among low -income adults. For instance, between 2014 and 2021, expansion states saw an average increase of 35% in Medicaid enrollment compared to non-expansion states.\n\n•National Health Interview Survey (NHIS): Data from the NHIS indicated that the uninsured rate among adults with incomes below 138% of the federal poverty level (FPL) dropped significantly in expansion states, from 35% in 2013 to 15% in 2021. Improved Access to Care •Evidence: Health Affairs (2022): A study found that Medicaid expansion was associated with a 5-11% increase in having a usual source of care and a 7% increase in cost-related barriers to care among lowincome adults. JAMA Internal Medicine (2017): Research indicated that low-income individuals in expansion states were more likely to receive preventive services, such as cancer screenings and routine check -ups, compared to those in non-expansion states. Increased Utilization of Health Services •Evidence: Annals of Internal Medicine (2017): The study found that Medicaid expansion led to increased access to primary care and specialist visits, particularly for chronic conditions such as diabetes and hypertension. New England Journal of Medicine (NEJM, 2019): The study showed a 9% increase in outpatient visits and a 6% increase in prescriptions filled among Medicaid enrollees in expansion states.

This financial incentive encouraged hospitals to improve discharge planning, patient education, and post-discharge support to reduce unnecessary readmissions. Enhanced Care Coordination:\n\n•The ACA promoted better coordination among healthcare providers, leading to smoother transitions from hospital to home or other care settings. Improved communication and follow-up care helped identify and address postoperative complications earlier, decreasing the likelihood of readmissions. Use of Evidence-Based Protocols:\n\n•Hospitals adopted standardized clinical pathways and protocols for surgical care to minimize variations in practice, which contributed to lower complication rates and readmissions. Improvement in Quality of Care in Surgical Settings: •Value-Based Purchasing Program: The ACA introduced this program to reward hospitals for providing high-quality care. Payments are adjusted based on performance metrics, including surgical outcomes, patient safety indicators, and patient satisfaction scores. This incentivized hospitals to focus on quality improvements in surgical care.\n\n•Emphasis on Patient Safety: The ACA supported initiatives to reduce hospital-acquired conditions and surgical site infections. Hospitals implemented safety checklists, infection control measures, and staff training programs to enhance patient safety in surgical settings.\n\n•Accountable Care Organizations (ACOs): By fostering the development of ACOs, the ACA encouraged integrated care models where providers share responsibility for patient outcomes. This collaborative approach improved preoperative and postoperative care management for surgical patients.\n\n•Expanded Access to Preventive Services: With increased insurance coverage, more patients received timely preventive care and elective surgeries before conditions worsened, leading to better outcomes and fewer complications. Challenges and Considerations: •Variable Impact: While overall readmission rates decreased, some hospitals, particularly those serving high-risk or low-income populations, faced challenges in meeting the targets due to factors beyond clinical care, such as socioeconomic determinants.\n\n•Documentation and Administrative Burden: Hospitals had to invest in data collection and reporting systems to comply with ACA requirements, which sometimes diverted resources from direct patient care.",

      "text": "The Affordable Care Act (ACA), enacted in 2010, sought to reduce overall healthcare costs while expanding insurance coverage and improving care quality. However, achieving cost reduction proved challenging due to several factors: •Rising Healthcare Costs Pre-Reforms: Healthcare expenses continued to escalate due to an aging population, increased prevalence of chronic diseases, and the high cost of new medical technologies and prescription drugs. These systemic issues are difficult to address through policy changes alone.\n\n•Limited Control Over Drug and Device Prices: The ACA did not implement significant measures to regulate the prices of prescription drugs and medical devices. Pharmaceutical and medical device companies wield considerable influence and successfully lobbied against price controls, leaving these costs largely unchecked.\n\n•Fee-for-Service Payment Model: The dominant fee-for-service model incentivizes providers to perform more procedures and tests, focusing on quantity rather than quality of care. Although the ACA introduced alternative payment models emphasizing value over volume, the transition has been slow and met with resistance from some healthcare providers.\n\n•Administrative Complexity and Costs: The U.S. healthcare system's complexity leads to high administrative expenses. The ACA introduced new regulations and reporting requirements, which increased administrative burdens for providers and insurers, potentially offsetting some cost savings.\n\n•Political Opposition and Legal Challenges: Persistent political opposition and numerous legal challenges created uncertainty and hindered the full implementation of the ACA's provisions. Efforts to repeal or weaken the law disrupted initiatives designed to control costs, such as Medicaid expansion in certain states.\n\n•Fragmented Care Delivery: The lack of coordination among various healthcare providers results in inefficiencies and duplicate services. While the ACA promoted Accountable Care Organizations (ACOs) to improve care coordination, integrating these models into the existing system has been challenging.\n\n•Consumer Behavior and Preventive Care: Changing patient behavior is crucial for cost reduction. Despite the ACA's emphasis on preventive services, many individuals continue to underutilize these benefits, leading to higher costs associated with preventable illnesses.\n\n•Lack of Price Transparency: Without clear information on the cost of services, consumers cannot make informed decisions, and market forces cannot effectively drive down prices. The ACA's measures to improve transparency have been insufficient in overcoming this challenge.\n\n•Slow Adoption of Health Information Technology: Implementing electronic health records (EHRs) and other technologies can reduce costs by improving efficiency. However, adoption has been slow due to high initial costs, ongoing maintenance expenses, and concerns about workflow disruptions.\n\n•Underfunding and Implementation Issues: Some cost-saving programs under the ACA were underfunded or not fully implemented due to budget constraints and administrative challenges, limiting their potential impact on reducing expenses.\n\n•High Cost of End-of-Life Care: A significant portion of healthcare spending occurs in the final months of life. The ACA struggled to address these costs due to the sensitive nature of end-of-life care discussions and political controversies surrounding the topic.\n\n•Variability in Medicaid Expansion: Not all states chose to expand Medicaid, which limited the ACA's ability to reduce uncompensated care costs nationwide and affected the overall risk pool of insured individuals.\n\n•Insurance Market Dynamics: Regulations that prohibited denying coverage based on pre-existing conditions and required comprehensive benefits led some insurers to raise premiums. Higher premiums can make insurance less affordable, affecting the ACA's goal of cost reduction. In summary, the ACA faced multifaceted challenges in reducing healthcare costs, stemming from systemic issues within the healthcare system, political and legal obstacles, stakeholder resistance, and complexities in changing established practices. While the ACA made strides in certain areas, significantly lowering overall healthcare expenses remains a complex goal requiring ongoing efforts beyond the scope of the legislation.",

      "text": "The Affordable Care Act (ACA), enacted in 2010, aimed to improve the U.S. healthcare system by expanding access, enhancing quality, and reducing costs. A significant component of this effort involved promoting the use of electronic health records (EHRs) and other healthcare technologies to improve care coordination among providers. Here's an analysis of how effective the ACA was in achieving this goal: Promotion of EHR Adoption:\n\n•Integration with Payment Models: The ACA introduced new care delivery models like Accountable Care Organizations (ACOs) and Patient-Centered Medical Homes (PCMHs). These models emphasize coordinated care and rely heavily on health information technology to share patient data among providers. The ACA incentivized providers to adopt EHRs by tying reimbursement to the use of these technologies in care coordination.\n\n•Quality Reporting Requirements: The law mandated the reporting of certain quality measures that are easier to track and report using EHR systems. This pushed healthcare providers toward adopting electronic systems to meet compliance requirements.\n\n•Support for Health Information Exchanges (HIEs): The ACA provided funding and support for the development of HIEs, which facilitate the secure sharing of patient information across different healthcare settings. This interoperability is crucial for effective care coordination. Effectiveness in Improving Care Coordination: •Increased EHR Adoption Rates: By 2020, EHR adoption among office-based physicians exceeded 85%, a significant increase from prior years. While the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health (HITECH) Act of 2009 initially spurred this growth through financial incentives, the ACA reinforced the importance of EHRs in new payment and care delivery models.\n\n•Enhanced Data Sharing: The promotion of HIEs and interoperability standards under the ACA has led to improved data sharing capabilities. Providers can now more easily access a patient's medical history, lab results, and medication lists, which is essential for coordinated care.\n\n•Reduction in Duplicate Testing: Improved access to patient records has helped reduce unnecessary duplicate tests and procedures, saving costs and improving patient burden.\n\n•Mixed Outcomes on Care Quality: While there have been improvements in certain areas like preventive care and chronic disease management, the impact on overall care quality and patient outcomes has been mixed. Some studies suggest modest improvements, while others indicate that simply adopting EHRs does not automatically translate to better care without proper implementation and use. Challenges and Limitations: •Interoperability Issues: Despite efforts, achieving seamless interoperability between different EHR systems remains a challenge. This limits the potential for full-scale care coordination across various providers and care settings.\n\n•Administrative Burden: The transition to EHRs has introduced significant administrative tasks for healthcare providers, sometimes detracting from patient care. Clinician burnout related to EHR use has been a growing concern.\n\n•Variable Implementation: The effectiveness of EHRs in improving care coordination often depends on how well they are integrated into clinical workflows. Inconsistent implementation and varying levels of user proficiency can hinder their potential benefits.",

This expansion improved access to healthcare services essential for managing chronic conditions.\n\n•Study Example: A 2017 study published in the Journal of the American Medical Association (JAMA) found that Medicaid expansion under the ACA was associated with a significant increase in insurance coverage among low-income adults, which led to better access to care for chronic diseases like diabetes and hypertension.\n\n•Enhanced Access to Preventive Services: The ACA mandated that most insurance plans cover preventive services without cost-sharing. This includes screenings for blood pressure and blood sugar levels, which are crucial for early detection and management of hypertension and diabetes.\n\n•Study Example: Research in Health Affairs  (2015)  showed that the use of preventive services increased after the ACA's implementation, particularly among populations at risk for chronic conditions.\n\n•Improved Medication Adherence: With better insurance coverage, more individuals could afford medications necessary for controlling chronic conditions.\n\n•Study Example: A 2018 study in Diabetes Care reported that Medicaid expansion states saw a significant increase in prescriptions filled for diabetes medications compared to non-expansion states.\n\n•Better Disease Management: The ACA encouraged coordinated care models, like Patient-Centered Medical Homes (PCMHs), which improve the management of chronic diseases through comprehensive care plans.\n\n•Study Example: According to a 2016 report in the American Journal of Managed Care, patients with chronic conditions enrolled in PCMHs had better health outcomes, including improved blood pressure and blood sugar control.\n\n•Reduction in Health Disparities: The ACA helped reduce racial and socioeconomic disparities in healthcare access, which disproportionately affect chronic disease outcomes.\n\n•Study Example: A 2018 study in The Lancet found that the ACA narrowed the gap in access to care between minority and white patients, leading to earlier diagnosis and treatment of hypertension and diabetes in underserved populations.\n\n•Positive Trends in Clinical Outcomes: Several studies have linked the ACA to measurable improvements in health markers associated with chronic conditions.\n\n•Study Example: Research published in Circulation (2019) indicated that states with Medicaid expansion experienced greater reductions in uncontrolled hypertension rates than non-expansion states.\n\n•Decreased Hospitalizations and Emergency Visits: Improved outpatient management of chronic conditions has led to fewer hospitalizations and emergency room visits.\n\n•Study Example: A 2020 study in Health Services Research showed a decline in hospital admissions for diabetic complications in Medicaid expansion states.",

      "text": "The correct answer is A. VII (Facial Nerve). Explanation: Geniculate neuralgia is a rare condition characterized by severe, sudden, and repeated episodes of deep ear pain. The pain is often sharp, shooting, or burning and can be triggered by stimuli such as swallowing or touching specific areas around the ear. This neuralgia is associated with the geniculate ganglion, which is a collection of nerve cell bodies associated with the facial nerve (cranial nerve VII). The facial nerve has several functions, including controlling the muscles of facial expression, conveying taste sensations from the anterior two-thirds of the tongue, and providing parasympathetic fibers to certain glands. The geniculate ganglion contains sensory fibers of the facial nerve, including those for taste and some sensation from the ear canal. When this ganglion is affected, it can lead to the symptoms observed in geniculate neuralgia. Conditions like Ramsay Hunt syndrome type II can involve the geniculate ganglion due to reactivation of the varicella-zoster virus (shingles) , leading to ear pain and facial paralysis. Other Options:\n\n• IX (Glossopharyngeal Nerve): Involved in glossopharyngeal neuralgia, which causes pain in the throat, tonsillar fossa, and the back of the tongue.\n\n• X (Vagus Nerve): Rarely associated with neuralgia but can cause cardiac and gastrointestinal symptoms if affected.\n\n• II (Optic Nerve): Associated with vision; lesions here lead to visual deficits, not ear pain.\n\nTherefore, geniculate neuralgia is specifically associated with the facial nerve (cranial nerve VII).

Threads of crimson and indigo weave through me, preserving memories of simpler times. The floral print? From a dress worn to a spring picnic. The plaid? A flannel shirt that braved the winter cold. I've offered comfort through the years, cradling newborns and sheltering children from stormy nights. Once, an ember burned my fabric, but Miss Eleanor patched me with a piece of her wedding gown, making me whole again.

Art education traditionally focuses on the development of artistic skills, appreciation of art history, and fostering creativity. Disability studies, on the other hand, is an interdisciplinary field that examines disability from a social, cultural, and political perspective, moving beyond mere medical or individual models of disability. Integrating disability studies into art education creates a dynamic synergy that enhances inclusivity and promotes critical inquiry within the educational landscape. **Understanding Disability Through Art** By incorporating disability studies into art education, educators and students gain a deeper understanding of disability as a social construct rather than just a physical or medical condition. This integration allows for exploration of themes such as representation, identity, and accessibility within the arts. It challenges preconceived notions and stereotypes about disability, encouraging a more nuanced and empathetic perspective. The relationship between art education and disability studies is mutually beneficial. Integrating disability studies into art education not only enhances inclusivity by ensuring all students are represented and can participate meaningfully but also enriches critical inquiry by challenging students to think deeply about social constructs, representation, and justice. It prepares students to be more empathetic, socially conscious individuals who value diversity and are equipped to contribute positively to an inclusive society.\n\nBy embracing disability studies, art education becomes a transformative space where all students can explore, create, and learn from one another's experiences, ultimately enriching the educational experience for everyone involved.",

However, disability studies offer a more expansive and inclusive perspective, recognizing disability as a cultural and social identity rather than merely a medical condition.\n\nThe interdisciplinary dialogue between art education and disability studies can challenge outdated metaphors and stereotypes associated with disability. By incorporating disability studies into art education, educators can promote critical thinking, self-awareness, and social justice. This integration encourages students to explore disability through creative expression, visual culture, and performance, allowing for more nuanced representations of disability in art and fostering an inclusive environment that acknowledges the lived experiences of disabled individuals.\n\nIn conclusion, the relationship between art education and disability studies lies in their shared goal of challenging societal norms and advocating for inclusivity, critical inquiry, and the representation of diverse bodies and identities through art. By merging these fields, art educators can better serve all students, including those with disabilities, while contributing to broader cultural and social discourses surrounding disability.",

      "text": "Art education plays a significant role in shaping an individual's personality by nurturing a wide range of cognitive, emotional, and social skills. Here are several ways in which art education contributes to personal development: 1. Fosters Creativity and Imagination: Art encourages individuals to think outside the box and explore new ideas. Engaging in artistic activities stimulates the imagination, allowing people to approach problems creatively and consider multiple solutions. 2. Enhances Emotional Expression: Art provides a medium for expressing feelings that might be difficult to articulate verbally. Through creating art, individuals can convey emotions and thoughts, leading to improved emotional intelligence and self-awareness. 3. Develops Critical Thinking and Problem-Solving Skills: Artistic creation often involves planning, experimenting, and making decisions about composition, color, and technique. This process enhances critical thinking and problem-solving abilities that are transferable to other areas of life. 4. Builds Confidence and Self-Esteem: Completing an artwork can give individuals a sense of accomplishment. Positive feedback and personal satisfaction from artistic endeavors boost confidence and encourage a willingness to take on new challenges. 5. Improves Fine Motor Skills and Coordination: Engaging in activities like drawing, painting, or sculpting refines fine motor skills and hand-eye coordination. This physical development is especially beneficial in early childhood but continues to enhance dexterity at any age. 6. Encourages Patience and Perseverance: Creating art often requires time and repeated efforts to achieve the desired result. This teaches patience and the value of perseverance, fostering a growth mindset that views challenges as opportunities to learn. 7. Promotes Cultural Awareness and Empathy: Studying art exposes individuals to different cultures, histories, and perspectives. Understanding the context behind various artworks cultivates empathy and appreciation for diversity. 8. Enhances Communication Skills: Art is a universal language that transcends words. Learning to interpret and create visual messages improves overall communication skills, enabling individuals to convey complex ideas and emotions effectively. 9. Provides Stress Relief and Emotional Well-Being: Artistic activities can be therapeutic. Focusing on creating art allows individuals to enter a state of flow, reducing stress and promoting relaxation. This contributes positively to mental health and emotional well-being. 10. Stimulates Academic Achievement: Research suggests that involvement in the arts can improve performance in other academic subjects. Skills developed through art-such as critical thinking, attention to detail, and persistence-enhance learning across disciplines. 11. Cultivates Social Skills and Collaboration: Participating in group art projects or classes fosters cooperation and communication. Sharing ideas and giving and receiving feedback enhance interpersonal skills and the ability to work effectively with others. 12. Sparks Curiosity and Lifelong Learning: Art education ignites curiosity about the world, encouraging individuals to ask questions and seek new knowledge. This inquisitive mindset supports continuous personal growth and adaptability. In summary, art education contributes significantly to personal development by enriching an individual's emotional depth, intellectual capabilities, and social interactions. By engaging with art, people develop a more nuanced understanding of themselves and the world around them, leading to a well-rounded and resilient personality.",

So does the best actress winner think Mia could ever win a Bafta or Oscar? After a dramatic pause, she delivered her verdict. \"Hopefully!\" \"It's been like a whirlwind,\" said Spider-Man actor Tom Holland, winner of the Rising Star Award. \"I'm so happy everything seems to be working out.\" The 20-year-old Brit isn't wrong there. Having made his screen debut in tsunami disaster movie The Impossible, he first appeared as Spidey in Captain America: Civil War and recently finished filming for Spider-Man: Homecoming. But Tom admitted the super hero role has its drawbacks. \"Ever since I was a kid I've wanted to be Spider-Man. It's been so fun, but my legs are in bits right now from spider poses after spider poses. \"So I'll be sitting down for the rest of the evening!\" It was perhaps inevitable that Meryl Streep's speech at the Golden Globes would come up at the Baftas. Asked about Donald Trump's response, supporting actress winner Viola Davis didn't hold back. \"Anyone who labels Meryl Streep an 'overrated' actress obviously doesn't know anything about acting,\" she said. \"That's not just directed towards Donald Trump -that's directed towards anyone.\" She didn't stop there. \"This is someone who is the master at her skill and she has lasted for 40 years in a very difficult profession,\" Viola continued. \"One of the things people have to know about this woman is that she is the most honourable, accessible human being you could possibly want to meet.\" Best actor winner Casey Affleck said he'd grabbed a word with Meryl Streep after the Baftas ceremony. \"She was taking pictures of people... and I told her how much her speech at the Golden Globes meant to all of us and how grateful I was that she did it and kicked in the door a little bit,\" he said. The Manchester by the Sea star said he hoped more actors would speak out. \"There is a big audience for these awards shows... and I have to say I'm very proud to be a part of the arts community. \"I don't always say some of the things I would like to say in those opportunities because there are people like Meryl Streep who say them much better than I can -and if they are going to be said it should be said very, very well because they are important.\" \"I'm a little bit wobbly,\" confessed Dev Patel a few minutes after winning the supporting actor prize for Lion. \"I really did not expect it, we have gone to so many awards ceremony and this one is where everything changed, on home turf with my family.\" Dev recalled how he had made his acting debut a decade ago on E4's teen drama Skins. \"I remember the first time I ever stepped on a film set, I never knew what a boom mic was,\" he laughed. \"My mum took me to an open casting of Skins after she saw an advert in Metro newspaper and 10 years on we are here at the Baftas -that is pretty amazing.\" Justin Hurwitz, who won the Bafta for his original music in La La Land, said that he'd written a title song that didn't end up in the movie. \"It was going to be in the middle of the movie but we nixed that, and then we toyed with using it in the end credits, and we nixed that at the last minute.\" And how about this? Another Day of Sun, from the famous traffic jam scene, was cut \"for many months\" before being put back in as the big opening number. Mel Brooks, who was awarded the prestigious Bafta Fellowship, was asked about whether he might write a comedy about Donald Trump. \"I'm not afraid of him, I don't think he's dangerous,\" said the 90-year-old writer, actor and producer. \"I think he's mostly an entertainer, a guy who wants audiences to love him. \"What I'm afraid of are all the guys around him, the people who whisper in his ears, like the people who whispered in George W Bush's ears and we got the Iraq War... \"I just hope that Trump stays the egomaniac he is, listens to no-one and then we'll all be safe. But if he believes these guys we're all in trouble.\" Mel was in a lighter mood as he plugged his new musical Young Frankenstein, which will open in London's West End this year after a run in Newcastle. \"I think, modestly speaking, it will be sensational,\" he chuckled.

ASCL complains a new funding formula for schools has reduced the basic level of school funding going forwards by too much. The meeting comes two days after requests for more money to spend on daily school costs were ignored by the chancellor in the Budget. Philip Hammond however did pledge £500m for school buildings, mainly new free schools -some of which could be grammar schools. One respondent said his school was moving to a \"bare bones education\", in which \"the components that make education special and enjoyable are being eroded away\". Some 95% of the 1,054 heads, deputies and senior teachers responding to the survey said they had cut back on support services -including equipment and materials, as well as mental health and special needs support. More than eight out of 10 said class sizes had increased -a claim strongly refuted by the Department for Education. And more than two-thirds said they had cut back on activities like clubs and trips. Just under three -quarters of respondents with GCSE-level classes said they had cut courses and just over three-quarters of heads with A-level students said they had also reduced subjects. Foreign modern languages, music, arts and drama were among subjects removed at A-level. Another said: \"Through no fault of their own, students will have restricted subject choices, in larger class sizes with less pastoral support, whilst still being expected to perform at the highest of standardsnonsense!\" One head said his school may have to axe its sixth form provision for next year and another said his school was starting to \"creak\" with all staff working to full capacity. Interim general secretary, Malcolm Trobe, said: \"School leaders will do their utmost to protect provision, as they always do, but they cannot provide everything that is asked of them without the resources they need. \"Unless the government invests more in the education system, there will be a significant impact on the lives and life chances of young people.\" A spokesman for the DfE said: \"As this week's Budget demonstrates, the government is determined to ensure every child has access to a good school place and is given the opportunity to fulfil their potential. \"The government has protected the core schools budget in real terms since 2010, with school funding at its highest level on record at more than £40bn in 2016-17and that is set to rise, as pupil numbers rise over the next two years, to £42bn by 2019 -20.\"",

Studies have \nshown a substan;al decrease in the number of uninsured surgical pa6ents post-ACA implementa;on. \nThis increase in coverage improved 6mely access to surgical care, allowing more pa;ents to receive \nnecessary procedures without ﬁnancial delays. However, while insurance coverage improved, some \ndispari6es in access to 6mely care persisted due to factors like provider availability and healthcare \ninfrastructure. \nReference Answer \nThe ACA led to earlier presenta+on of acute surgical diseases, improved \ncancer screening, earlier stages of diagnosis \n \n, increased lis8ngs for heart and lung transplants, and increased \nrehabilita+on a7er trauma . However, no  \naccess to signiﬁcant inpa+ent mortality beneﬁts were iden8ﬁed.": "Prompt \nIn what ways did the ACA impact preven;ve services, par;cularly for chronic disease management in \nminority popula;ons? \nO1-preview \nThe Aﬀordable Care Act (ACA) improved access to preven;ve services by requiring insurance plans to \ncover preven;ve care without cost-sharing. This mandate par;cularly beneﬁted minority popula;ons, \nwho historically face higher rates of chronic diseases like diabetes and hypertension. By expanding \nMedicaid and oﬀering subsidies for private insurance, the ACA increased coverage among minori;es, \nenabling more individuals to access screenings,  \nvaccina;ons, and rou;ne check-ups. This led to earlier  \ndetec;on and beKer management of chronic \ncondi;ons, helping to reduce health dispari;es and improve overall health outcomes in these \ncommuni;es. \nReference Answer \nThe ACA improved access to preven8ve services by ensuring insurance coverage for services like cancer screenings. \nMedicaid expansion led to earlier detec8on and treatment of diseases such, as head and neck cancer par8cularly among \nlow-income and minority popula8ons."
