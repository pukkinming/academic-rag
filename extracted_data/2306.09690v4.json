      "text": "Recent research has focused on the effectiveness of Virtual Reality (VR) in games as a more immersive method of interaction. However, there is a lack of robust analysis of the physiological effects between VR and flatscreen (FS) gaming. This paper introduces the first systematic comparison and analysis of emotional and physiological responses to commercially available games in VR and FS environments. To elicit these responses, we first selected four games through a pilot study of 6 participants to cover all four quadrants of the valence-arousal space. Using these games, we recorded the physiological activity, including Blood Volume Pulse and Electrodermal Activity, and self-reported emotions of 33 participants in a user study. Our data analysis revealed that VR gaming elicited more pronounced emotions, higher arousal, increased cognitive load and stress, and lower dominance than FS gaming. The Virtual Reality and Flat Screen (VRFS) dataset, containing over 15 hours of multimodal data comparing FS and VR gaming across different games, is also made publicly available for research purposes. Our analysis provides valuable insights for further investigations into the physiological and emotional effects of VR and FS gaming.",

      "text": "E MOTIONS in Virtual Reality (VR) tend to be different than those in traditional Flatscreen (FS) gaming because VR provides a more immersive and sensory experience. In traditional FS gaming, players view the game on a twodimensional screen, which can create a sense of detachment between the player and the game world. However, in VR, players are placed in a fully realized three-dimensional environment and can interact physically with the game world, which creates a stronger sense of presence and immersion  [1] . Although prior research has examined the impact of both VR  [2] -  [7] , and FS gaming  [8] -  [10]  on individuals' physiological signals, these investigations have been conducted in distinct settings, leading to different experimental conditions and outcomes. Through our study, the utilization of both measures in conjunction has allowed for the attainment of a comprehensive and holistic perspective on the two distinct gaming methodologies that were subject to testing. This approach has not only allowed us to pinpoint the design obstacles and possibilities that are pivotal to the advancement of the gaming experience but also to obtain a more thorough understanding of the subject matter.\n\nThe first two authors (*) contributed equally to this work.\n\nRecent advances in VR technology have ushered in a new era of VR gaming. As a result, many interactive experiences traditionally available in the conventional FS space are now moving to VR. Many traditional desktop games, primarily the first-person shooter  [2] ,  [3]  and horror-adventure type games  [4] ,  [5] , have quickly been ported to VR. Therefore, at this time of pivotal change, there is a need to assess the potential usability gains that VR brings to help make quantitative decisions instead of speculative claims. It can be done by investigating the users' emotional responses in VR game-play and by doing a comparative analysis of FS gaming.\n\nEmotions play a critical part in our lives, influencing our decision-making, perception, social interactions, learning, memory, and creativity  [11] ,  [12] . Understanding emotional responses helps researchers design better user experiences and improve the usability, acceptability, and accessibility of technologies. We found only a few studies that have explored emotional challenges in gaming  [13] ,  [14] . Researchers have often used several physiological signals to predict arousal, valence, or even specific emotions by detecting physiological changes in the human body  [15] . Due to the longer history and greater accessibility, emotions in FS games have been extensively researched, exploring their importance for player engagement and enjoyment. Studies have investigated factors like game content, player experience, personality, and culture,  [8] ,  [9] ,  [16]  and the use of physiological and behavioral measures have provided deeper insight into players' emotional responses  [10] .\n\nOur primary novel contribution in this work is to present the first-ever systematic comparison of physiological effects between VR and FS gaming, identifying the emotional and physiological effects of VR and FS gameplay via self-reporting questionnaires and physiological signals. Together, these measures provided a comprehensive subjective and objective outlook on the two gameplay methods tested in our user study. As part of this study, we have curated a 15+ hour multimodal affective dataset, named Virtual Reality and FlatScreen (VRFS). This novel dataset has been made publicly accessible for research purposes. The dataset for this study can be found here -GitHub link.",

      "text": "Emotional responses can be assessed via three different methods: self-reports from the participant (collected, for example, through questionnaires or interviews), physiological changes in the participant's body (e.g., heart rate or skin conductivity), and directly observable behaviors (e.g., facial expressions or eye gaze)  [17] . Among these methods, selfreports are often subject to several biases, and limitations  [18] , however, these are our greater source for the ground truth. To understand emotions, we must first have a way to quantify them. For this purpose, many researchers have created different methods of classifying emotions, such as the Tree of Emotions  [19] , the wheel of emotions  [20] , the Pleasure, Arousal Dominance scale (PAD), also known as the Valence Arousal Dominance (VAD) model. From the VAD model, the Circumplex Model of Affects (CMA) was derived, which is a two-dimensional Cartesian model to represent emotional stimuli based only on arousal (Y-Axis) and valence (X-Axis) only  [21] . CMA representation is easier to understand and use than the VAD model. The CMA is based on a circular structure, which allows for a more intuitive representation of emotions. Additionally, subjective measures like Self-Assessment Manikin (SAM) and Visual Analog Scale (VAS) are commonly employed to assess arousal and valence in VR  [22] ,  [23] . SAM and VAS offer a convenient and reliable way to quantify emotional responses, aiding researchers in understanding the emotional impact of VR environments and applications.\n\nMeanwhile, emotion recognition from physiological signals is expedient since it taps the pure, unaltered emotion in contrast to behavioral responses like facial expressions, which can be faked. Recent advancements in wearable technologies have shown a strong potential for hassle-free acquisition of physiological signals in a non-intrusive manner and have thus inspired us to investigate emotional responses in VR and FS gameplay using physiological signals. Physiological signals offer additional unique information regarding users' interactions with and responses to a system. Researchers have also utilized multiple sensors to help evaluate and monitor human physiological signals. Signals like EDA  [24] ,  [25] , ECG  [26] ,  [27] , and Electroencephalogram (EEG)  [11] ,  [28] ,  [29]  have been widely used. The use of these sensors is showcased in a wide variety of applications, including medical  [30] ,  [31] , neuromarketing  [32] ,  [33] , sports training  [34] ,  [35]  and many more. Additionally, researchers have also proposed the use of these physiological signals as controllers in games to enhance connect among multiple players  [36] . Researchers have used physiological signals like electrodermal and cardiovascular activity to analyze and predict emotions  [37] . They have used these findings to create guidelines for VR developers to create more immersive games. Classification and analysis of emotions have been important for researchers for a long time. From a tree-like structure that divided emotions into primary, secondary, and tertiary  [19]  to a size axis model proposed by  Kort et al. [38] . This led to the development of the Valence Arousal and Dominance Model by Osgood, Suci, and Tannenbaum  [39] .\n\nThe use of physiological signals for emotional classification has increased over the past decade thanks to improved technology surrounding procuring such data. For instance, The recent Empatica E4 device has shown the ability to capture physiological data reliably in most cases  [40] .",

      "text": "Emotional analysis for immersion in VR has been much studied recently. Driving scenarios are commonly used in VR research as a means to study and understand human perception, due to the familiar and relatively realistic experience they offer. Researchers have used driving simulation games and wheel controllers to create an environment as close as possible to real driving and used self-reporting surveys for felt emotions, and experience  [7] ,  [41] ,  [42] . These studies revealed that VR dissociates the user from the real world more than FS, thus making VR more immersive. The uneasiness and motion sickness caused by the current VR systems made these studies more challenging. Research with young adults on a driving simulator in VR and FS showed that VR elicits more positive emotions, and the sense of immersion and flow is more remarkable in VR games than in FS  [43] . Researchers have established that EEG signals from the brain are a relevant metric for decoding emotional arousal  [44] . One study tried to recreate traffic-light-based responses in VR and tracked the system's effectiveness with EEG signals from the brain  [45] . They showed that in an average of eight participants, traffic events could reach an 87% accuracy compared to real-world events in VR. Studies have also shown that VR can elicit specific emotions with predictable outcomes. Researchers have been able to create \"anxious\" and \"relaxation\" producing simulations in VR with a significant certainty of predicted emotion arousal  [46] . Further, they have compared these simulations between VR and FS, and have found VR to be more \"relaxing\" and immersive than FS  [47] ,  [48] . With these results, researchers have looked into VR as a medium for required emotion elicitation as an upgrade to existing stimuli. Meuleman et al.  [49]  observe that emotional responses in a VR gaming study are clustered in two segments; joy and fear. Work has also been done to successfully create deep learning models to predict peak emotions in gameplay using several biosignals  [15] . VREED  [50] , is one of the first datasets that provide behavioral (eye tracking) and physiological signals [Electrocardiogram: ECG and Galvanic Skin Response: GSR (also known as Electrodermal Activity: EDA)] data in addition to self-reporting for comparison of emotion elicitation in VR and FS 360°Video-Based Virtual Environments. Further, recognizing the emotions users feel allows researchers to control these scenarios live, making systems like this useful for emotional training for children with Autism. Similar research has been done to compare the immersiveness and motion sickness in first and third-person points of view in VR  [51] , which suggests that although the first-person perspective is more immersive, it is also more prone to inducing sickness. The emotions induced and their strength varies significantly in FS and VR as factors such as screen size and worldview have been shown to significantly affect mental immersion, which in turn affects emotions felt by the users  [52] -  [54] . Other factors such as cybersickness also come into play when exploring emotions in VR gaming  [55] . Overall positive emotions such as hope, courage, relaxation, and calmness are more associated with gaming in VR  [14] ; however, it is essential to note that these emotions are also greatly affected by the genre of the game title. It is possible to induce particular emotions by designing gameplay in a particular manner  [56] .",

      "section_name": "C. Affective Datasets",
      "text": "Data gathering is essential for many studies; however, this process is extremely lengthy, expensive, and requires significant resources. To combat these, many studies utilize publicly available datasets instead. One prominent dataset is the International Affective Picture System (IAPS)  [57]  that provides a range of picture-based emotional stimuli and participant ratings. Another recent example is the expanded version of the International Affective Digitized Sounds (IADS-E)  [58]  dataset. It augments the previous International Affective Digitized Sounds (IADS)  [59]  dataset and provides a larger selection of audio-based emotional stimuli combined with the participant rating.\n\nInstead of just the emotional ratings, many datasets also offer physiological as well as behavioral data of the participants  [60] -  [62] . These datasets record the participants' behavioral (eye gaze movement, face recording) and physiological (EDA, Blood Volume Pulse: BVP, voice features) signals while they are exposed to emotional stimuli. For example, MAHNOB-HCI  [63]  is an affective dataset consisting of the face videos, audio signals, eye-gaze data, and peripheral/central nervous system physiological signals of participants reacting to 20 different emotional videos providing a valuable resource for analyzing emotion recognition and affective computing. Another dataset called the Database for Emotion Analysis using Physiological signals (DEAP)  [64]  analyzes affective music videos, their reported ratings, and the recorded EEG data of the participants. Similarly, the Database for Emotion Recognition through EEG and ECG Signals from Wireless Low-cost Offthe-Shelf Devices (DREAMER)  [65]  analyzes the ECG and EEG data from participants experiencing audio-visual stimuli. The MEG-Based Multimodal Database for Decoding Affective Physiological Responses (DECAF)  [66]  contains the recorded brain signals similar to DEAP. However, these were captured using a Magnetoencephalogram (MEG) that requires physical contact with the participant's scalp but facilitates a natural affective response.\n\nThere also exist multiple datasets for participants reacting to different stimuli, such as the Bio-Reactions and Faces for Emotion-based Personalization for AI Systems (BIRAFFE2)  [67]  that consists of accelerometer data, ECG, and EDA signals, participants' facial expression data, and a personality and game engagement questionnaires. In the field of VR, VREED  [50]  is one of the first datasets that analyzes behavioral (eye tracking) and physiological signals (ECG and EDA) data in addition to self-reporting for comparison of emotion elicitation in VR and FS 360°in video-based virtual environments. Another dataset, Affective Virtual Reality System (AVRS)  [68] , has rated arousal, valence, and dominance of similar 360°VR environments using self-reporting. Further, datasets have rated arousal and valence and have analyzed correlations between head movement and self-reported values  [69] ,  [70] . In addition to self-reporting, some datasets have also used physiological data collected via EEG for emotional classification  [71] ,  [72] .\n\nThe review outlined in section II-B establishes that there is a dearth of rigorous analysis regarding the physiological effects associated with VR and FS gaming. This deficiency in the study of physiological and psychological reactions to both VR and FS gaming can be attributed to the unavailability of standardized datasets that offer emotional responses for both types of gaming. Section II-C of the review highlights the significant limitation of many affective datasets, including DEAP  [64]  and MAHNOB-HCI  [63] , in that they do not utilize VR stimuli to elicit emotions, despite its well-known ability to provide immersive experiences. Additionally, existing datasets that analyze VR stimuli rely on different stimulus modalities, such as 360°videos  [38]  or pictures embedded in VR environments such as 360°videos  [69]  or pictures embedded in VR environments  [72] . Most affective datasets primarily focus on either physiological or psychological responses, making systematic comparisons between VR and non-VR responses challenging and hampering the ability to draw comprehensive conclusions. This limitation emphasizes a gap in the field and presents an important opportunity for researchers to perform more comprehensive and standardized investigations that could improve the understanding of individuals playing games in VR and aid in enhancing the experience for new users. To this end, we have also made the entire VRFS dataset publicly accessible.",

The volunteers played four games each in a randomized order. Each game was effectively played and rated twice. To optimize the resources, each volunteer only played the FS version of each game. Since the perceived category of emotions has not been found to differ significantly between VR and FS (for example, see  [73] ), we expected that the chosen games through such a pilot trial would elicit the desired emotions in VR gameplay as well. The following tools were used to judge arousal:\n\n• SAM is a widely used state measurement tool  [74] .\n\nIt has simple cartoon-like manikin icons that can be used to plot the CMA dimensions (arousal and valence).\n\nThe valence scale ranges from 1=\"happy\" to 5=\"sad\" pictures of SAM. Meanwhile, the arousal scale ranges from 1=\"calm\" to 5=\"excited\" pictures of SAM. engaging in the games, using separate scales for joy, happiness, calmness, relaxation, anger, disgust, anxiousness, fear, and sadness. After completing the pilot study, we had the SAM and VAS results for each game, using which we could see how each game performed and in which quadrant they lie, as shown in Fig.  1 . Arousal and valence ratings for each of the 12 games can be found in Table  I . SAM and VAS ratings have been collected to be used as the \"ground truth\" or reference point for the research, against which the physiological responses can be compared. Although we collected dominance as well through SAM, we found that it did not differ significantly between participants (H: 11.0, p-value: 0.44) according to the Kruskal Wallis test, so we excluded the dominance while performing the stimuli selection. In order to analyze which game should be chosen as the representative of their quadrant, we plotted (see Fig.  1 ) the distance r of that game from the origin as well as the angle dθ that they are farther from 45°as r = (|2.5 -Arousal|) 2 + (|2.5 -V alence|) 2 , and\n\nGames with the highest r value, i.e., the largest distance from the origin and the least difference from 45°, would be the best representatives for that quadrant. Taking values farther away from the origin would show higher arousal or valence in that preferred quadrant. Values near the 45°line would ensure that both arousal and valence are almost equally high.\n\nThe following games were chosen from each quadrant (see gameplay screenshots in Fig.  2 ).\n\n• Quadrant 1: High Arousal High Valence (HVHA) Dirt Rally 2.0 (Fig.  2(b) ) is chosen as it has the minimum dθ value of 7.7 along with the maximum r value of 1.80. This is a rally-style racing game that offers a realistic driving experience. • Quadrant 2: High Arousal Low Valence (LVHA) Phasmophobia (Fig.  2(a) ) is chosen in this quadrant due to its high r value of 1.11 and is the closest to 45°with a dθ value of 15.5.

      "text": "With the four selected games from the pilot study, we invited 33 participants to play these games in FS and VR. Each participant only played one game to prevent VR fatigue. The details of the data we collected are explained in Table  II . We measured the participants' BVP and EDA. These signals have been shown to represent physiological state accurately  [50]  and can be measured non-intrusively with a wrist device. The device is worn similarly to a wristwatch and does not obstruct the gameplay experience of the participants. The BVP and EDA signals are explained in more detail below. These signals were recorded using an Empatica E4 device and synced with each other. The sampling rate for these is hard coded into the firmware and optimized to capture the frequency content of relevant signals (BVP -64 Hz, EDA -4 Hz).\n\n1) BVP: The BVP signal measures the changes in blood volume inside arteries and capillaries. A Photoplethysmography (PPG) sensor uses light from an LED to measure the refraction and estimate blood volume. The amount of light that returns to the PPG sensor is positively proportional to the blood volume. PPG gives the average value of blood in the tissues through which light has passed. The BVP in Empatica E4 is processed through the PPG sensor at 64 Hz. Using this measure of the amount of blood passing over each pulse through a PPG, we can effectively calculate Heart Rate variability (HRV) using BVP  [76] . We then extract the Lowfrequency (LF) and High-frequency (HF) features from the HRV. The LF band (0.04-0.15 Hz) is affected by breathing from 3 to 9 bpm.  [77]  while the HF or respiratory band (0.15 -0.40 Hz) is influenced by breathing from 9 to 24 bpm  [78] . The ratio of LF to HF power (LF/HF ratio) has been proposed as an indicator of sympathovagal balance, reflecting an increase in values during states of \"sympathetic dominance\" induced by emotional and physiological stress  [79] . Similar to previous research  [80] , we have employed the LF/HF ratio within the context of an ambulatory condition, which encompassed participants having unrestricted movement (with the exception of keeping the off-hand restricted) and accounting for the variability in breathing patterns.\n\n2) Electrodermal Activity: Electrodermal activity (EDA) refers to the variation of the electrical properties of the skin in response to sweat secretion. Applying a low constant voltage, Skin Conductance (SC) change can be measured noninvasively. EDA has been measured with the Galvanic Skin Response sensor. EDA was sampled at a frequency of 4 Hz, with the data being measured in micro siemens (µS). EDA data consists of two components, Skin Conductance Level (SCL) [tonic component] and Skin Conductance Response (SCR) [phasic component]. SCL is a general measure of slowmoving psycho-physiological activation  [81] , while SCRs depict higher-frequency changes directly related to an external stimulus  [82] . The time series of SC can be characterized by a slowly varying tonic activity (i.e., SCL) and a fast varying phasic activity (i.e., SCR)  [83] .",

      "text": "Overall, we expected VR games to be perceived as more immersive  [84]  and arousing. Due to the high physical nature of control in VR games, we expected the mentally and physically challenging nature to reflect in the physiological signals. The following hypotheses informed our study.\n\n1) H1: Previous research has suggested a positive correlation between heart rate and cognitive load  [85] -  [87] . Moreover, studies have shown higher immersion and increased cognitive load in virtual reality (VR) gaming compared to traditional first-person shooter (FS) gaming  [88] . Consequently, we anticipated an elevated heart rate during VR gaming. 2) H2: A positive relationship is observed between emotional intensity and immersion  [46] . Since immersion in VR is higher than in FS gaming, we expected that immersion induced through VR gameplay would enhance one's appraisal of their context compared to FS gameplay. 3) H3: Due to the higher cognitive load involved, VR gaming induces greater emotional and physiological stress compared to FS gaming  [89] . Additionally, emotional and physiological stress often leads to an increase in LF/HF sympathovagal balance values, indicating sympathetic dominance  [79] . Hence, we anticipated an elevation in LF/HF ratio during VR gaming. 4) H4: A higher cognitive load is observed with learning novel information  [90] . VR controls and navigation are relatively new to the target users, requiring more concentration and physical effort. Accordingly, users are likely to feel less dominant during VR gaming compared to FS gaming. 5) H5: VR gaming is likely to induce more arousal compared to FS gaming due to higher immersion in the VR 2 Thrustmaster T300RS Force Feedback racing wheel: https://www.thrustmaster.com/en-gb/products/t300rs/ 3 Empatica E4 Wristband: https://www.empatica.com/research/e4/ environment, which will be reflected in increased SAM ratings. Since SCR and SCL have been found to be much more frequent when the individual is aroused  [91] , we expected an increased skin conductance (EDA) activity as well. 6) H6: Past literature establishes a correlation among valence, arousal, and dominance  [92] . In the present context, we postulate a heightened prominence of this correlation within Virtual Reality (VR) gaming as compared to Full-Screen (FS) gaming.",

To avoid the order effects, this order was counterbalanced to ensure equal participants in both categories, VR first and FS first. A verbal instructions protocol was used to ensure that instructions were held constant for all participants. Before the start of the session, participants were informed about the study itself but not about the purpose or the hypotheses. Participants were asked to sign the consent form and fill out the \"participant demographics and pre-exposure\" questionnaire. This was followed by a brief introduction of their specific game and the objective they had to complete. Then, the Empatica E4 wristband was attached to the participants and switched on. The LED signals of the E4 device were noted to ensure correct functioning. After the equipment test was complete, the participants were told to relax and not think of anything extreme or arousing to establish a baseline. This lasted for 5 minutes. In the case of the VR experiment, participants were introduced to the use of VR while the researchers helped fit the Rift S headset to the participant's comfort. Comfort in the use of hand controllers was confirmed by asking participants to navigate basic menus. In the case of the FS, the participants were shown the basic controls of the keyboard and mouse. In Dirt Rally 2.0, the Thrustmaster wheel was used in both FS and VR.\n\nAfter this, the study continued with the participant playing the game, trying to complete the decided tasks. These tasks (and the game level/map) were the same for every participant playing the same game to ensure similar gameplay. The session ended when the participant completed the tasks for that specific game. At the end of each game session, participants filled out the \"Post-Exposure\" questionnaire consisting of the SAM and VAS. At the end of both sessions, participants were briefed about the study objectives and thanked for their participation.",

We observe that the arousal and valence fall in the expected quadrant. However, further statistical significance analysis is required to confirm this. Considering both modalities taken together (VR+FS), we observe that higher reported arousal is evident for games rated as high arousal.

This indicates that the participants playing the games in the LVHA and HVHA categories experience significantly higher arousal as compared to those playing games in the LVLA and HVLA categories. Even though participants perceived the HVHA in FS as less arousing than in VR, the arousal ratings in this quadrant were still significantly higher than the LVLA of the same. In summary, the participants experienced four distinct emotional states over the differing valence and arousal dimensions (HVHA, HVLA, LVHA, LVLA) through a statistically significant difference in reported arousal and valence.",

The data was found to be nonnormal upon using the Shapiro-Wilks test (for all: W>0.89, p-value<0.00009). We conducted a nonparametric Wilcoxon's signed-rank test (W) for the analysis of nonparametric data, specifically used to evaluate matched-pair data based on their differences  [97] . The 'r' statistic serves as an effect size measure for this test, spanning a range from 0 to 1, wherein a value of 0 implies a minor effect and 1 denotes a substantial effect. Upon comparing the arousal between VR and FS gameplay using nonparametric Wilcoxon's signed-rank test(W), we found that the reported arousal in VR (Median: 4.00 IQR: (3.00 -5.00)) was higher than FS (Median: 3.00 IQR: (2.00 -4.00)), which was statistically significant according to the above test(W(33) = 66.5, p-value = 0.007, r = 0.47). We also observed a higher value for valence in VR gameplay (Median: 4.00 IQR: (3.00 -5.00)) as compared to FS gameplay (Median: 3.00 IQR: (3.00 -4.00)) as shown in Fig.  3(b ). However, the Wilcoxon signed-rank test found this difference statistically non-significant (W(33) = 75.5, p-value = 0.262, r = 0.19).

Upon further inspection, we found a moderate negative association between dominance and valence for high-rated dominance cases (dominance ≥ 4, ρ(14) = -0.42, p = 0.12), which was not significant; however, there was also a strong negative correlation between the same for low-rated dominance cases (dominance ≤ 2, ρ(32) = -0.53, p = 0.01), which was statistically significant.\n\n2) VAS: We plotted the mean and standard deviation recorded in VR and FS gameplay for the different emotions in Fig.  4  and reported emotions per CMA quadrant.

The cvxEDA model is a physiologically inspired model that describes skin conductance as a combination of three factors: the phasic component, the tonic component, and additive white Gaussian noise. The cvxEDA algorithm uses convex optimization to break down the EDA signal into its different components and provides  a comprehensive explanation of EDA. We utilized Z-score normalization to standardize the data around a mean of zero and a standard deviation of one. This method involved adjusting each feature by subtracting its mean and dividing by its standard deviation. By doing so, we achieved uniform  2) Heart Rate: We present the mean heart rate values for the participants during VR and FS gameplay, based on the game played in Fig.  6(a) . The heart rate was normalized w.r.t. the baseline for each player using the Z-score normalization. The heart rate observed during VR gameplay (µ = 81.52, σ = 10.71) was higher than that observed during FS gameplay (µ = 77.27, σ = 9.92). We found the difference to be statistically significant (t(32) = -2.5, p-value = 0.016, Cohen's d = 0.41) upon conducting a paired t-test on the data after confirming normality.

      "text": "We expected an elevated heart rate during VR gameplay according to our first hypothesis (H1) partly in response to the increased cognitive load in VR among other factors such as novelty. Our analysis observed a higher mean heart rate in the VR scenario. A paired t-test indicates a statistically significant result (t(32) = -2.5, p-value = 0.016, Cohen's d = 0.41), validating H1. Therefore, our results align with those of Malinska et al.  [87] , who explain this phenomenon as a consequence of increased immersion which may in turn lead to an additional cognitive burden on the user.\n\nThe second hypothesis (H2) proposes that increased immersion in VR gameplay will result in a greater elicitation of desired emotions. To evaluate this, we will refer to the radius of the SAM result in the CMA graph (Equation  1 ). By examining this data, we can see that emotional elicitation (arousal) during VR gameplay (Median: 5.66 IQR: (5.00 -6.40)) is higher than FS gameplay (Median: 4.47 IQR: (4.12 -5.39)), and this difference is statistically significant (W(33) = 92.5, p-value = 0.003, r = 0.04) according to the Wilcoxon Signed Rank test. Furthermore, upon comparing the games within different quadrants of the CMA plot, we notice the discrepancy in distance from the center demonstrated statistical significance specifically in VR gameplay, exhibiting a substantially higher effect size (H(3): 10.7, p-value: 0.01, η 2 = 0.35) unlike the FS condition where statistical significance was not present (H(3): 6.3, p-value: 0.09, η 2 = 0.21)), using the Kruskal Wallis Test.\n\nAccording to our third hypothesis (H3), we expected that the LF/HF Sympathovagal balance would increase in the case of VR due to the increased emotional and physiological stress. In our study, we observed a higher value of LF/HF in VR (µ : 1.43, σ: 0.63) as compared to FS (µ : 1.37, σ:0.60). Still, the difference was not statistically significant using a t-test (t(24) = -0.33, p-value = 0.74, Cohen's d = -0.09). This is most likely because the LF/HF ratio does not accurately measure cardiac sympathovagal balance  [99] .\n\nThe fourth hypothesis (H4) suggests that emotions felt by users will be less dominant in VR compared to FS displays. Our experimental data backs this hypothesis; the dominance of emotions has been found to be lesser in VR gameplay (Median: 2.00 IQR: (1.00 -3.00)) than in FS gameplay (Median: 3.00 IQR: (2.00 -4.00)). This difference was significant, as indicated by the Wilcoxon signed-rank test (W(33) = 88.0, p-value = 0.02, r = 0.40). It is possible that this effect was due to the fact that many participants were new to VR and had little to no experience with it while they were familiar with using FS monitors. This lack of experience may have led to a decrease in emotional dominance in the unfamiliar VR environment.\n\nAccording to our fifth hypothesis (H5), the participants should experience a higher level of arousal while in VR compared to being in a FS environment. Our study observed an increased SCL (VR Median: 1.17 IQR: (0.40-3.51); FS Median: 0.99 IQR: (0.31-3.28)); the difference was not statistically significant. However, we did observe a statistically significant increase in the participants' arousal levels when playing in VR (Median: 4.00 IQR: (3.00-4.00)) compared to FS (Median: 3.00 IQR: (2.00-4.00)) (W(33) = 66.5, p-value = 0.007, r = 0.04). This effect may be partially attributed to the greater immersion, intensity, variability, and dynamic nature of VR experiences. We observe similar results with 3D VR eliciting a larger emotional response as compared to 2D VR  [100] .\n\nIn line with our sixth hypothesis (H6), we found evidence of a correlation between dominance and arousal as well as dominance and valence. This supports previous research that reported a quadratic relationship between arousal and dominance  [92] . In addition, our results revealed a higher correlation between valence and dominance in VR (ρ(33) = 0.34, p = 0.047) compared to FS games (ρ(33) = 0.06, p = 0.73). We observe a similar trend between arousal and dominance (VR: ρ(33) = 0.31, p = 0.07; FS: ρ(33) = 0.002, p = 0.98). However, there is no correlation between arousal and valence, which might be due to the variance in the gameplay itself, and more research is needed about this effect.",

Our findings can also inform the development of more engaging games for both entertainment and nonentertainment purposes, such as rehabilitation  [101]  and managing post-traumatic stress disorder  [102] .\n\nBy incorporating multimodal signals, developers can create adaptive gaming experiences that respond to users' emotions and physiological responses, for example, an adaptive physical therapy game that adjusts to the user's mental and physical state in real-time has immense potential  [103] ,  [104] .\n\nOur dataset can also be used by developers to design more engaging and immersive video games. Our findings indicate that emotional response is less dominant in VR compared to FS displays, suggesting that developers can explore ways to improve emotional engagement in VR games. By incorporating our findings into their game design, developers can enhance the emotional experience of players and improve the overall user experience.\n\nWhile the physiological effects of VR have been investigated  [105] , the emotional reactions are not well-known. Our curated dataset, VRFS, can be used to further understand the emotional effects of gaming in VR and compare them with FS gaming as well as to validate the effect of arousal/valence on physiological signals.

      "text": "One limitation of our study was the size and sample of the participants. Accordingly, a larger study is needed to produce a more extensive dataset that is more generalizable to a broader population. Our research focused exclusively on adults' emotional reactions, but it is very likely that younger players, including children, will experience more extreme emotional reactions  [106] . Therefore, research should explore how different demographics, based on age, gender, etc., are susceptible to comparative effects. We acknowledge the differences in resolution (FS 1080p, VR 1440p), FPS (FS 60FPS, VR 80FPS), audio setup, and distance from the monitor in our experiment that arose due to the nature of VR setup as factors that may have influenced participant immersion which may be explored further. Another limitation of this study is that participants were asked to keep their off-hand as still as possible while playing the game to prevent motion artifacts. This may have reduced comfort for some participants, and it is possible that more natural data could have been collected if participants had been allowed to move their off-hand freely. The imposed restriction on off-hand movement during data collection introduces a partially ambulatory context, which could potentially impact the interpretation of LF/HF ratio. Therefore, it is important to consider the results within this specific context, and further research may be necessary to validate the use of LF/HF ratio in partially ambulatory conditions. It would also be interesting to explore individual differences in psychological and physiological responses, for example, based on openness to experience [107], exposure beyond the novelty effect period [108], previous experience with VR, etc. It will also be essential to gather longitudinal data, as this will enable a more robust understanding of how the observations of the current study change over time.",

      "text": "In this study, we introduced a physiological dataset and performed a statistically significant analysis to compare emotional responses in VR and FS gaming. Using a pilot study with six participants, we curated four games designed to effectively evoke varied emotional responses. We captured physiological measures like blood volume pulse and electrodermal activity, alongside self-reported emotions from 33 participants. Our findings confirm that the selected games elicited the intended emotions. Furthermore, there was a distinct, statistically significant differentiation in arousal and valence ratings, showcasing that participants traversed varied emotional landscapes, notably HVHA, HVLA, LVHA, and LVLA. In a direct comparison, VR settings amplified emotional responses, with participants displaying heightened arousal, increased cognitive load, elevated stress, and reduced dominance when juxtaposed against FS gaming experiences. This research provides pivotal insights into the broader realm of virtual reality, elucidating emotional responses across varied applications such as gaming, and paves the way for comprehensive studies of VR's psychological implications. In contribution to the academic landscape, we're releasing the curated VRFS dataset, encompassing over 15 hours of multimodal physiological data contrasting FS and VR gaming across varied game genres. We believe this dataset will serve as an invaluable resource for the academic community, fostering future research endeavors in this domain.",
