      "text": "Multimodal emotion recognition based on speech and text is essential for human-computer interaction (HCI)  [1] . The MER's fundamental concept is to acquire modality representations and subsequently fuse them  [2, 3] . In representation learning, contrastive learning-based methods have been widely applied to various multimodal tasks  [4] [5] [6] . These methods rely on the multi-view redundancy assumption, which states that the shared information across different modalities can sufficiently capture the critical features required for downstream tasks  [7, 8] .\n\nAlthough multimodal emotion representation learning has made significant progress under this assumption, it does not always hold in broader real-world multimodal scenarios. In multi-view nonredundant scenarios, the information contained in each modality is not necessarily relevant to the downstream task. To address this issue, existing studies  [9] [10] [11] [12]  leverage techniques such as adversarial learning, parameter sharing, and subspace learning to decouple modality-specific and shared features.\n\nThe aforementioned methods are capable of extracting modalityspecific and shared features. However, they are unable to ensure that the learned representations are pertinent to the tasks.  [13]  adopts an information-theoretic perspective to describe the modality-specific and shared information pertaining to a given task. A Contrastive Mutual Information Estimation (CMIE) method has been introduced to optimize modality-specific and shared representations that are applicable to the task  [14] . In such methods, neural networks (NNs) are typically employed to determine mutual information scores between modalities  [15, 16] . However, the efficacy of representation learning can be compromised by the instability of these approaches when there is a substantial distributional disparity between task labels and input modalities.\n\nIn multimodal representation fusion, early methods primarily relied on tensor fusion and simple feature concatenation  [17, 18] . Recent advances have introduced cross-attention mechanisms to better model semantic dependencies and task-oriented alignment across modalities. However, these mechanisms can still suffer from the introduction of redundant noise and increased modeling ambiguity, particularly when emotion-related information is inconsistently conveyed across different modalities  [19, 20] .\n\nIn this work, we aim to address two key challenges in MER: the difficulty of extracting and aligning task-relevant information across heterogeneous modalities-stemming from their inherent representational differences-and the inconsistencies in emotional cues conveyed by different modalities, as illustrated in Fig.  1 . To tackle these challenges, we propose a Decoupled Representations with Knowledge Fusion Method (DRKF) for MER. Our model consists of two modules: the Optimized Representation Learning Module (ORL), inspired by  [21] , indirectly aligns the input modalities with the label distribution through progressive modality augmentation learning, thereby overcoming the challenge of mutual information estimation in the CMIE method caused by modality-label distribution discrepancies. Following the ORL, the Knowledge Fusion Module (KF) consists of a Fusion Encoder (FE), an Emotion Classification Submodule (EC), and an Emotion Discrimination Submodule (ED). The FE, based on self-attention mechanism, identifies the dominant modality of the current sample and integrates complementary emotional information from other modalities to enhance the fused representation. Under emotionally inconsistent conditions, the ED further constrains the fused representation to retain discriminative cues regarding intermodal emotional discrepancies, thereby mitigating potential errors caused by incorrect dominant modality selection. Finally, the EC takes the fused representation as input to perform the emotion classification task. Through their collaborative design, these three components enable more robust and adaptable multimodal emotion recognition.\n\n• We introduce an optimized representation learning module, which learns an optimal enhanced modality to guide the alignment of distributions across modalities as well as between modalities and labels, thereby facilitating more effective representation decoupling.",

      "text": "Bengio  [22]  emphasized that the performance of machine learning models heavily depends on the selection of input features. Different feature representations can entangle varying underlying explanatory factors, potentially obscuring their distinct contributions to the learning process. Multimodal emotion representations can be categorized into feature engineering-based representations and deep neural network-based representations. The former relies on expert knowledge, including acoustic features extracted using openSMILE  [23]  and textual features from emotion lexicons  [24]  and syntactic structures  [25] , while the latter leverages deep learning to automatically extract high-level features. Representative models include BERT  [26] , RoBERTa  [27] , wav2vec 2.0  [28] , and WavLM  [29] . Building on deep representations, multimodal emotion representation learning can be further categorized into single-stream and multi-stream models. Single-stream models use a shared encoder to learn joint representations within a unified latent space, whereas multi-stream models maintain separate pathways for each modality and integrate them later to capture cross-modal interactions  [30] . While multi-stream architectures effectively preserve modalityspecific information and enhance cross-modal interactions, they can also introduce irrelevant noise, hindering optimal fusion performance. Decoupled representation serves as a key mechanism to filter out irrelevant information and improve fusion quality  [9] .\n\nTo enhance the effectiveness of decoupled representations, recent studies have incorporated contrastive learning to reduce intermodal distributional discrepancies and achieve decoupling of shared representations across modalities  [31, 32] . Additionally, some approaches employ subspace mapping techniques, adversarial learning, and orthogonality constraints to extract task-relevant modalityspecific information  [10, 11, 33] , while others leverage informationtheoretic methods to quantify the task relevance of private information, further improving the interpretability and discriminative power of learned representations  [14, 34, 35] .",

      "text": "Morency et al.  [36]  identified five core challenges in multimodal learning: representation learning, modality conversion, modality alignment, co-learning, and modality fusion. Among these, modality fusion is essential for cross-modal knowledge integration. Existing fusion strategies can be broadly categorized into feature-level, decision-level, and interaction-based fusion. Feature-level fusion combines features from different modalities, such as through concatenation  [37]  or time-scale-aware integration  [38] , but increases the classifier's burden in handling redundancy and modality misalignment. Decision-level fusion  [39]  integrates modality-specific predictions using methods like ensemble learning, weighted averaging, or voting, but often overlooks fine-grained interactions crucial for tasks like emotion recognition. Interaction-based fusion learns cross-modal relationships through attention mechanisms or latent space alignment. For instance,  [40]  proposed a multi-hop attention mechanism, allowing textual tokens to iteratively query audio features, thus enhancing fusion expressiveness.\n\nAlthough attention-based fusion strategies are effective, they require task-specific queries to adapt to dataset variations, limiting unified multimodal modeling. To address this,  [19, 20]  proposed a bidirectional cross-attention mechanism to improve adaptability and generalization across datasets. However, while bidirectional cross-attention has proven effective, it may introduce noise when dealing with emotionally inconsistent modalities, leading to model confusion and performance degradation.  (1) The ORL Module comprises three components: Modality Encoding (ME), Progressive Augmentation (PA), and Decoupled Representations (DR). The ME integrates an acoustic encoder and a semantic encoder to extract modality-specific embeddings. The acoustic encoder, based on the pre-trained wav2vec2 model 1  , transforms raw audio into acoustic embeddings, while the semantic encoder, leveraging the pre-trained RoBERTa model 2  , encodes raw text into semantic embeddings. The PE employs two identically structured residual autoencoder networks, each consisting of five residual autoencoder blocks with six linear layers per block. The purpose of this component is to learn the optimal feature augmentation for the acoustic and semantic modalities. The DR includes contrastive training and emotion modality (Emodality) shuffling mechanisms. The contrastive training method eliminates task-irrelevant modality noise and facilitates the learning of decoupled representations. The Emodality shuffling mechanism restructures optimized modality pairs for downstream processing.",

Both ED and EC are implemented as two independent multilayer perceptrons (MLPs). 3.3.1 The Decoupled Representations.

      "text": "The Progressive Augmentation. To address the challenge of directly computing mutual information, we introduce contrastive mutual information estimation, formulated as follows:\n\nIn the above equations, 𝑀 represents the batch size during training. The expectation operator E is taken over the joint distribution of positive and negative sample pairs, with or without conditioning on the label 𝑦. The function 𝑓 (•, •) measures correlation between inputs. Positive samples (𝑥 1 , 𝑥 2 ) or (𝑥 1 , 𝑥 2 , 𝑦) share semantic alignment, while negative samples 𝑥 - 2 or (𝑥 - 2 , 𝑦) are drawn from other instances in the batch.\n\nAlthough contrastive mutual information estimation circumvents the challenges of direct computation, it still faces a critical limitation: the representation gap between modalities and task labels further increases the difficulty of mutual information estimation. As shown in Eq. (  7 ), 𝑥 1 and 𝑥 2 follow continuous distributions in their respective feature spaces, whereas 𝑦 is discrete. This modality-label distribution mismatch makes score estimation more challenging. To tackle these challenges, we propose a progressive modality augmentation strategy that guides the alignment between modalities and between modality and label distributions by iteratively learning the optimal augmented modality. The optimal augmented modality is defined as follows:\n\n• Optimal augmented modality: When 𝐼 (𝑋 ; 𝑌 ) = 𝐼 (𝑋 ; X1 ), X1\n\nis the optimal unimodal augmentation of 𝑋 , which implies that the only information shared between 𝑋 and X1 is taskrelevant, and that 𝑋 and X1 lie within the same subspace.\n\nOur proposed progressive augmentation strategy, as illustrated in Fig.  3 , is designed to learn the optimal augmented modality. Unlike traditional static feature augmentation methods, our proposed progressive augmentation strategy is a dynamic optimization approach based on original modality features, enabling a stepwise optimization process to achieve optimal modality augmentation. To guide the learning of the augmented features, we introduce two carefully designed constraints. First, by constraining the distribution discrepancy between the augmented modality and the original modality, we ensure that the augmented features reside in the same subspace as the original modality features, thus reducing modality heterogeneity. Second, by minimizing the discrepancy between the augmented modality and the task label distribution, we ensure that the augmented features are aligned with the task label distribution to the greatest extent. Finally, we control the model's overall performance by adjusting the weights of these two constraints.\n\nThe process of progressive augmentation can be described by the following equations:\n\nWe utilize a residual autoencoder 𝑓 𝐴𝐸 to learn the optimal unimodal augmentation T𝑠𝑒𝑞 , T𝑐𝑙𝑠 for the text feature sequence.\n\nWhere 𝑇 𝑠𝑒𝑞 ∈ R 𝑑 𝑛 ×𝑑 𝑧 denotes the feature sequence output of the text encoder, with 𝑑 𝑛 as the sequence length and 𝑑 𝑧 as the dimensionality of each sequence element. T𝑐𝑙𝑠 ∈ R 𝑑 𝑧 represents the global feature vector obtained by average pooling the sequence feature vector.\n\nSimilarly, the optimal unimodal augmentation for the speech feature sequence is calculated as follows:\n\nWhere 𝑆 𝑠𝑒𝑞 ∈ R 𝑑 𝑛 ×𝑑 𝑧 denotes the feature sequence output of the speech encoder, with 𝑑 𝑛 as the sequence length and 𝑑 𝑧 as the dimensionality of each sequence element. S𝑐𝑙𝑠 ∈ R 𝑑 𝑧 represents the global feature vector obtained by average pooling the sequence feature vector.\n\nTo ensure that the augmented modality remains in the same subspace as the original modality, we use the Mean Squared Error (MSE) loss to constrain the learning space of the augmented modality. Meanwhile, the Kullback-Leibler divergence (KLD) loss is employed to enforce the augmented modality to learn the distribution of the task labels. The calculation formula is as follows:\n\nHere, 𝑆 𝑖 𝑠𝑒𝑞 and 𝑇 𝑖 𝑠𝑒𝑞 represent the original feature sequence vectors of the 𝑖-th sample in the speech and text modalities, respectively. S𝑖 𝑠𝑒𝑞 and T 𝑖 𝑠𝑒𝑞 represent the augmented feature sequence vectors. 𝑀 is the batch size, and 𝐶 denotes the total number of emotion categories. The true label of the 𝑖-th sample in the fusion modality for category 𝑐 is denoted as 𝑦 𝑐 𝑖 , while ŷ𝑐 𝑖 represents the predicted probability for the same sample and category.

The framework consists of two core modules: the Optimized Representation Learning (ORL) module and the Knowledge Fusion (KF) module. Specifically, the ORL module aims to decouple task-relevant modality-shared and modalityspecific information while reducing inter-modality heterogeneity, thereby facilitating more effective multimodal fusion. The KF module is designed to learn a fusion representation that is sensitive to emotional discrepancies across modalities, which enhances the model's robustness in scenarios where emotional cues from different modalities are not aligned. Extensive experiments on three widely used benchmark datasets for multimodal emotion recognition demonstrate that DRKF outperforms several state-of-the-art models across multiple evaluation metrics, exhibiting strong performance and generalization capabilities.\n\nDespite the promising results achieved by the proposed DRKF model on bimodal emotion recognition tasks, certain limitations remain. The current evaluation is limited to the audio-text bimodal setting, and has not yet been extended to trimodal or higher-order multimodal fusion scenarios. In future work, we plan to further explore the adaptability and scalability of DRKF in more complex multimodal input settings, such as those involving video, speech, and text, to better address the demands of real-world multimodal emotion recognition applications.",
