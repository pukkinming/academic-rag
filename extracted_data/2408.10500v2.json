      "text": "Multimodal Emotion Recognition (MER) aims to integrate information from various modalities-such as text, speech, and visual cues-to accurately identify and understand human emotions. This field has shown great promise in applications ranging from humancomputer interaction to mental health care and education. However, achieving robust performance in real-world scenarios remains a significant challenge. The MER2024 Challenge addresses these challenges through two specialized tracks: MER-NOISE and MER-OV.\n\nThe MER-NOISE track focuses on enhancing noise robustness in emotion recognition systems. In practical settings, noise is pervasive, making it difficult to ensure that audio streams are free of distortions and video frames maintain high resolution. This track targets the two most prevalent types of noise: audio additive noise and image blur. Participants are encouraged to employ data augmentation techniques  [48]  and other innovative methods  [38]  to improve the resilience of emotion recognition systems against these noise factors.\n\nThe MER-OV track introduces the concept of open-vocabulary emotion recognition, addressing the inherent subjectivity and ambiguity in emotion labeling. Traditional datasets often constrain label spaces to a few discrete categories, relying on multiple annotators and majority voting to determine the most likely label. This approach can overlook correct but non-candidate or minority For further details, refer to the original Emotion-LLaMA paper  [7] .\n\nlabels, leading to potential inaccuracies. The MER-OV track challenges participants to generate any number of labels across diverse categories, striving for a more nuanced and precise description of emotional states  [32] .\n\nTo address these challenges, we propose a robust system that integrates the advanced capabilities of Emotion-LLaMA for generating high-quality labels with a Conv-Attention model designed for efficient multimodal feature fusion. Our approach is detailed in Figure  2 , where we outline the workflow and demonstrate how each component contributes to overcoming the limitations of existing methods. A key limitation of previous approaches  [8]  lies in their reliance on models to generate pseudo-labels for unlabeled data, which are then used to augment training datasets. The effectiveness of this strategy depends heavily on the initial model's quality-if the model lacks robustness, it can produce low-quality pseudolabels, which may introduce errors in subsequent training phases. To mitigate this issue, we introduce Emotion-LLaMA  [7] , a model specifically designed to generate high-quality pseudo-labels for the unlabeled samples in the MER2024 dataset. As illustrated in Figure  1 , Emotion-LLaMA processes inputs from multiple modalities, utilizing visual and auditory features as contextual information to enhance the interpretation of text-based emotions. This approach ensures robust multimodal emotion understanding, even in the presence of loss or noise of modality.\n\nIn the feature extraction stage, we leverage high-performing unimodal models referenced in the official baseline papers  [32, 34] , such as HuBERT  [22]  and CLIP  [50] . Our experiments revealed that visual modality models are particularly vulnerable to noise, prompting us to pre-train MAE  [19]  and VideoMAE  [56]  on the unlabeled samples from the MER2024 dataset. This pre-training effectively captures both static and dynamic visual expression features. Additionally, to enhance the accuracy of textual feature extraction, we employed prompt-based strategies for models like Qwen  [3, 55]  and Baichuan  [63] , which were carefully evaluated for their effectiveness in capturing emotion-related information.\n\nDespite the strong performance of Emotion-LLaMA in MER, its substantial computational overhead and slow iteration cycle present challenges. To address these, we propose Conv-Attention, a lightweight and efficient hybrid framework that combines convolutional and global attention mechanisms for feature fusion. Conv-Attention leverages the inductive biases inherent in convolutional operations, allowing the model to perform effectively even with limited data. By integrating a simple attention mechanism with multiple convolutional blocks, the model can prioritize critical features while minimizing the impact of noise. The attention mechanism excels in querying features from a global perspective, while the convolutional operation focuses on capturing fine-grained semantic details within a limited receptive field. This combined approach mitigates the disadvantages of each individual method, enhancing overall model performance.\n\nIn summary, our team makes the following contributions:   [20] , MAE  [19] , VideoMAE  [56] , BERT  [13] , and HuBERT  [22] , followed by basic linear fusion layers  [8, 31, 68] . However, these simplistic models struggled to capture the complexity of multimodal data, prompting the development of more sophisticated cross-attention-based fusion models  [5, 14, 16] . Despite their advancements, these fusion techniques  [30, 38, 44, 53]  often lead to competition between modalities, where dominant modalities disproportionately influence the results.\n\nTo address these challenges, PMR  [41]  introduced a common message hub to better capture cross-modal dynamics. Subsequent research has focused on pre-fusion alignment, as seen in Emo-tionCLIP  [66] , which aligns temporal visual and textual data, and VAT  [15] , which aligns visual with audio features. However, these models still face challenges, including the need for large datasets and the difficulty of capturing fine-grained emotional features due to a reliance on global attention mechanisms.\n\nOur work overcomes these limitations by leveraging the advanced capabilities of Emotion-LLaMA for generating high-quality pseudo-labels and introducing a Conv-Attention model for efficient multimodal feature fusion, significantly improving the robustness and accuracy of emotion recognition in noisy environments.",

      "text": "The advent of large multimodal models (LMMs) has revolutionized emotion understanding, providing unprecedented inferential capabilities  [2, 6, 23, 47, 57] . Instruction-tuning techniques, pioneered by models such as InstructionGPT  [46] , FLAN  [11] , and OPT-IML  [24] , have further expanded the practical applications of these models  [58, 59] . In the context of emotion recognition, Instruc-tERC  [26]  has advanced conversation-based emotion recognition by introducing additional emotion alignment tasks. DFER-CLIP  [67] , built on the CLIP model  [50] , has shown promise in dynamic facial expression recognition. MER-MCE  [9]  has pushed the boundaries by inferring the causes of emotional triggers in conversations through multimodal inputs. Notably, GPT-4V  [35]  has demonstrated strong capabilities in generalized emotion recognition tasks.\n\nDespite these advances, most approaches rely on single emotion labels, often neglecting non-candidate or minority yet correct labels. Addressing the need for more nuanced emotion descriptions in real-world contexts, AffectGPT  [36]  proposes a multimodal, explainable, open-vocabulary emotion recognition approach, using GPT-4V to generate visual and acoustic signals and extract reliable labels. EmoVIT  [62]  further contributes by generating visual emotion instruction data using paired annotations.\n\nBuilding on these developments, our approach utilizes Emotion-LLaMA  [7]  to generate detailed multimodal emotional descriptions, resulting in comprehensive open-vocabulary labels. Emotion-LLaMA's capability to align multimodal features within a semantic space allows it to maintain robust emotion understanding even in the presence of modality loss or noise, significantly enhancing the accuracy and robustness of emotion recognition systems in real-world applications.",

MAE, designed for the visual domain, reconstructs obscured segments of input images, compelling the model to learn both global and local features, which is advantageous for facial recognition and emotion analysis. VideoMAE extends MAE's concept to video by applying random masking to video frames and training the model to reconstruct missing parts, effectively leveraging spatiotemporal characteristics for tasks such as video classification.

This structure integrates convolutional blocks with attention mechanisms to introduce inductive biases, improving performance on limited-scale data. The convolutional branch captures semantic details due to its limited receptive fields, while the attention branch focuses on global, emotionally salient features.\n\nWe began by using a multilayer perceptron (MLP) to standardize the channel depth of features from different modalities (audio, visual, text) to a common dimension.
