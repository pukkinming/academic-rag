      "text": "Electroencephalography (EEG) signals provide a promising and involuntary reflection of brain activity related to emotional states, offering significant advantages over behavioral cues like facial expressions. However, EEG signals are often noisy, affected by artifacts, and vary across individuals, complicating emotion recognition. While multimodal approaches have used Peripheral Physiological Signals (PPS) like GSR to complement EEG, they often overlook the dynamic synchronization and consistent semantics between the modalities. Additionally, the temporal dynamics of emotional fluctuations across different time resolutions in PPS remain underexplored. To address these challenges, we propose PhysioSync, a novel pre-training framework leveraging temporal and cross-modal contrastive learning, inspired by physiological synchronization phenomena. PhysioSync incorporates Cross-Modal Consistency Alignment (CM-CA) to model dynamic relationships between EEG and complementary PPS, enabling emotion-related synchronizations across modalities. Besides, it introduces Long-and Short-Term Temporal Contrastive Learning (LS-TCL) to capture emotional synchronization at different temporal resolutions within modalities. After pre-training, cross-resolution and cross-modal features are hierarchically fused and fine-tuned to enhance emotion recognition. Experiments on DEAP and DREAMER datasets demonstrate PhysioSync's advanced performance under unimodal and cross-modal conditions, highlighting its effectiveness for EEG-centered emotion recognition.

      "text": "Electroencephalographic (EEG) signals, reflecting brain activity and psychological processes, contain vital psychophysiological information  [3] . Unlike other physiological signals, EEG is directly tied to the central nervous system, offering more precise emotional insights  [21] . This advantage has driven the development of various EEG-based emotion recognition methods  [22] ,  [23] . However, many methods still rely on hand-crafted features like power spectral density (PSD) and differential entropy (DE), rather than fully exploiting the potential of deep learning models. In contrast, some approaches use raw EEG data with advanced techniques like CNNs and LSTMs to capture spatial and temporal features. For instance, Yin et al.  [24]  proposed a framework combining graph CNNs and LSTMs, while Ding et al.  [25]  introduced TSception, a multi-scale CNN that integrates dynamic temporal, asymmetric spatial, and high-level fusion layers for more effective representation learning across temporal and channel dimensions.\n\nDespite these advancements, the complexity of human emotional states poses a significant challenge. A single EEG modality is insufficient to provide a comprehensive representation of the current emotional state, and achieving satisfactory recognition in terms of both accuracy and robustness remains a challenge  [26] . To address this, researchers have explored methods that combine signals from the central nervous system  [27]  (e.g., EEG) and the peripheral nervous system  [28]  (e.g., GSR, ECG, EMG, EOG, etc.). Jimenez et al.  [29]  proposed a multi-modal and multi-source Domain Adaptation (MMDA) method for addressing the multi-modal emotion recognition problem using EEG and eye movement signals. Li et al.  [30]  presented a fusion model that leverages the Cross Modal Transformer (CMT), Low Rank Fusion (LRF), and modified CMT (MCMT) to reduce incongruity and redundancy among multimodal physiological signals.",

      "text": "Contrastive learning is a form of self-supervised learning that aims to learn representations without relying on manual labels. It has demonstrated state-of-the-art performance across various domains, including computer vision (CV)  [31] , natural language processing (NLP)  [32] , and bioinformatics  [33] . Typically, contrastive learning methods involve pre-training representations on relatively large datasets, which are then fine-tuned for downstream tasks  [34] . However, in the domain of physiological signal emotion recognition, particularly in Electroencephalogram (EEG)-based emotion recognition, the absence of large-scale datasets presents a significant challenge for pre-training. To address this, Shen et al.  [19]  proposed a contrastive learning strategy tailored for cross-subject generalization. This approach learns the similarities between samples from different subjects exposed to the same stimuli, enabling the model to generalize across subjects. Notably, their method does not rely on large external datasets; instead, it generates numerous self-supervised labels based on the alignment of experimental designs across subjects. One form of contrastive learning involves classifying samples into positive and negative pairs based on the internal relationships within the data. Using a specific loss function, this approach aims to maximize the similarity between positive pairs while minimizing the similarity between negative pairs  [31] . Kan et al.  [35]  utilized self-supervised learning alongside a novel genetics-inspired data augmentation method to achieve state-of-the-art performance in EEG-based emotion recognition. Simultaneously, contrastive learning methods have also been introduced in cross-corpus EEG-based emotion recognition. Liu et al.  [36]  introduced a cross-domain contrastive learning strategy during the pre-training phase and incorporating inter-electrode structural connectivity during the finetuning phase, the method significantly improved the accuracy of emotion recognition across different datasets. Our work introduces a multi-modal contrastive learning approach that effectively integrates both temporal and cross-modal contrastive learning to better combine multi-modal information.",

      "text": "This section introduces PhysioSync, a novel contrastive learning framework with two phases: self-supervised pretraining and supervised fine-tuning (Fig.  2 ). Section A covers the data input and augmentation for multimodal physiological signals. Section B presents the temporal and cross-modal contrastive optimization mechanism. Section C describes the fine-tuning strategy, aligning pre-trained features with emotion labels through task-specific layers.\n\nA. Preliminaries 1) Long-and Short-term Clip Segmentation: To capture multi-scale emotional features, we set different time lengths of t to train encoders for long-term and short-term feature extraction, respectively. Specifically, the input is processed in mini-batches from subjects A and B as an example, the data from each trial of subject A is divided into t-second clips in temporal order, resulting in N clips denoted as X eeg i,A (i = 1, 2, 3, . . . , N ), where X eeg i,A ∈ R C×S , C is the number of channels, and S is the number of sampling points. Similarly, subject B's eeg data is divided into X eeg i,B (i = 1, 2, 3, . . . , N ). segments X eeg i,A and X eeg i,B from the same video stimulus form a positive pair, while X eeg i,S and X eeg j,S (j ̸ = i, S ∈ {A, B}) from different video stimuli form a negative pair. For all subjects and other modalities, such segmentation is performed, then segments for K video stimuli from 2 subjects are randomly sampled to form a mini-batch\n\nHere, m can represent both eeg or pps.\n\n2) Data Augmentation: A major challenge in using physiological signals for emotion recognition is the limited number of subjects and small public datasets, which can hinder model training  [37] . To address this, data augmentation techniques, such as scaling and noise addition, can be employed to expand the dataset  [38] , and introduce more positive samples for contrastive learning. The data augmentation step generates more training samples and improves emotion-related semantic consistency learning against moderate noise. Specifically, two scaling factors are applied to the original samples, and Gaussian noise with a fixed mean and signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) is added. The process can be summarized as follows: where A represents the data augmentation operation. Through scaling, noise addition, and their combination, the data is augmented to five times its original size. Finally, the input can be represented as:\n\nB. Self-supervised Pre-training Strategy 1) Pretraining model: Previous work has shown that selfsupervised pre-training strategies can significantly aid model learning. Building upon the structure from  [39] , we have designed an encoder, as illustrated in Fig.  3 .\n\nPhysiological signals are input and transformed into z embeddings through parallel linear layers, aiming to encourage the model to focus on different views of features. Another linear layer followed by an activation function is used to gate the embeddings with information useful for emotion recognition. Subsequently, E i and Ẽ are multiplied elementwise and aggregated across the z embeddings to obtain e = (e 1 , . . . , e z ). The formula is as follows  [39] :\n\nwhere σ represents the sigmoid function, which constrains the output values between 0 and 1, and ⊙ denotes the Hadamard product. BN stands for batch normalization, and RELU denotes the activation function. By this method, the input features Gm are transformed into token sequences from different views, which can be further processed by subsequent layers.\n\nBefore passing to the next layers, the embedding e is prepended with a learnable class token E cls , which serves to aggregate information from the entire sequence. To integrate positional and modality information, learnable positional embeddings E pos and modality embeddings E mod are added to the input embeddings. This approach ensures that the input encompasses not only the sequence content but also positional and modality information:\n\nThe core component of the Transformer is the multi-head self-attention mechanism  [40] . The embedding ẽ is transformed into query Q, key K, and value V through three linear layers, with the calculation formula as follows:\n\nwhere d e is the dimension of the embedding. Then we use h heads for self-attention, with each head represented as\n\n, where W is the weight matrix. Subsequently, after further processing by a feed-forward neural network (FFN), then repeat twice. Incorporating emotional prompt (learnable token)  [41]  boosts the model's sensitivity to emotional changes. We can simply denote the entire encoder as f m :\n\n2) Long-and Short-Term Temporal Contrastive Learning: To align the stimuli across subjects and achieve physiological synchronization among different subjects, the features extracted by the encoder are used for intra-modal temporal contrastive learning (TCL). Different values of t are used to perform contrastive learning at different time resolutions, and the corresponding encoders are pre-trained accordingly. Inspired by the SimCLR framework  [31] , a nonlinear projection head is employed between the encoder and the final contrastive loss. The structure, shown in Fig.  3 , is used to process the features extracted by the encoder:\n\nwhere W 1 , W 2 , W 3 are the weight matrices of the three linear layers; b 1 , b 2 , b 3 are the bias vectors and\n\ndenote the output features of each layer. where i denotes the number of physiological signal segments, S denotes the subject. Subsequently, the similarity between samples is calculated using the following formula:\n\nSimilar to the SimCLR, we use the normalized temperaturescaled cross-entropy to define the loss function as follows: Calculate loss L m and L cc by (  10 )-(  12 ), then obtain total loss L by  (13)  10:\n\nAbate loss L through optimizer updating parameters of θ eeg , θ pps , θ pr eeg and θ pr pps\n\nuntil all possible pairs of subjects are enumerated 12: end for 13: Output: Parameters θ eeg , θ pps Where T is the training epochs.\n\nsimilarity of negative pairs. The loss for the mini-batch L m is given by:\n\n3) Cross-Modal Consistency Alignment: To align physiological signals from different modalities, the features extracted by the encoder are also used for cross-modal contrastive learning (CM-CL). Physiological signal segments from different modalities induced by the same stimulus are treated as positive pairs, while others are treated as negative pairs. Additionally, before calculating the similarity, the features pass through a linear layer to obtain zm i,s . Then according to formulas (10)-(  12 ), the cross-modal contrastive loss L cc is computed.\n\nDuring the pre-training phase, the total loss L consists of the contrastive loss within the EEG modality L eeg , the contrastive loss within peripheral physiological signals L pps , and the cross-modal contrastive loss L cc :\n\nWe empirically set α = 0.5, β = 0.5 to balance EEG and PPS supervision, and γ = 1 to emphasize cross-modal consistency and enhance feature alignment.\n\nAfter pre-training, the encoder can effectively extract consistency features across different modalities at various time resolutions. Algorithm 1 summarizes the pre-training process.",

Specifically, the pre-trained encoders are employed to extract consistency features for EEG and PPS at long or short time resolutions (the short-term input is derived by decomposing the long-term input into 1s ). Then their long-term and shortterm features are fused by concatenation separately into H eeg and H pps , which are then input into the modal fusion module.\n\nIn the Modal Fusion Module (Fig.  4 ), to flexibly adjust the information flow, we use Maximum Class Probability (MCP)  [11]  to compute the confidence level of each modality and assign weights to the features based on their confidence. MCP enhances the robustness and accuracy of the fusion process by measuring the confidence of each modality, ensuring more reliable decision-making in the presence of uncertain or noisy data:\n\nMCP(H m ) = max k∈y\n\nwhere w represents the set of network parameters, m can represent both eeg or pps.

This section first describes the DEAP and DREAMER datasets in detail and the related implementation details. We then show the results of various experiments on both datasets.\n\nA. Dataset 1) DEAP: A multimodal physiological signal dataset used for emotion recognition, encompassing electroencephalogram (EEG) signals and several peripheral physiological signals. We primarily utilized EEG, galvanic skin response (GSR), electromyography (EMG), and electrooculography (EOG). These signals were recorded from 32 subjects as they watched 40 different short videos, with each recording session lasting 63 seconds (60 seconds for emotional arousal and 3 seconds for baseline). The Self-Assessment Manikin (SAM)  [44]  was utilized to capture the emotional ratings of the subjects, which included assessments of arousal, valence, liking, and dominance for each video, rated on a scale from 1 to 9. In this experiment, we utilized arousal and valence as the classification criteria. When the ratings are greater than or equal to 5, they are labeled as high arousal or high valence. Conversely, ratings below 5 are labeled as low arousal or low valence. This approach forms a binary classification for each dimension, and the combination of the two dimensions results in a four-class classification.\n\n2) DREAMER: The dataset comprises 14-channel EEG and 2-channel Electrocardiogram (ECG) data from 23 subjects (14 males and 9 females). Each subject viewed 18 movie clips, with durations ranging from 65 to 393 seconds. These clips were designed to elicit various emotions, including amusement, excitement, happiness, calmness, anger, disgust, fear, sadness, and surprise. Following each clip, subjects provided subjective evaluations of valence, arousal, and dominance using the Self-Assessment Manikin (SAM) on a scale from 1 to 5. The midpoint of the scale served as the threshold value: ratings of 3 or below indicated low valence or arousal, while ratings above 3 indicated high valence or arousal.",

Each trial contains a 60-second emotion segment and a 3-second baseline. Following  [45] , we averaged the baseline into a 1-second reference and subtracted it from the emotion segment. The corrected signals were segmented into 5-second clips, yielding 480 clips per participant. With 32 participants and 40 videos, this resulted in 15,360 segments for 10-fold cross-validation.\n\nFor the DREAMER dataset, we used the raw data provided by the official release. No artifact removal or filtering was applied, except that the ECG signals were downsampled to 128 Hz to match the sampling rate of other modalities. A similar baseline correction procedure was applied. The data was then segmented into 1-second windows for both pre-training and classification stages.\n\nDuring the pre-training phase, we organized the dataset tensor along five dimensions: video clips, subjects, 1, channels, and sampling points. In each fold, every epoch iterated through all the video clips in the current training data. In the finetuning phase, applying the same criteria, we divided the data along the video clips dimension and then reshaped the first two axes-video clips and subjects-into a sample axis.

Due to the limited number of subjects in the dataset, the results in  [11] ,  [19] ,  [25]  show significant data fluctuations when evaluated with cross-subject criteria, with some standard deviations exceeding 10, affecting the reliability. Therefore,we primarily adopt a subject-dependent evaluation using a unified ten-fold cross-validation protocol. In each fold, self-supervised pre-training and fine-tuning were performed exclusively on the corresponding training set, followed by evaluation on the corresponding test set. The best model from each fold was retained, and final results were reported as the mean and standard deviation across all folds. For completeness, we also report results under the cross-subject setting, where the leave-one-subject-out (LOSO) protocol was used. All evaluations strictly follow established practices to ensure reliable and fair comparisons.\n\nWith an input signal length of t = 1s for short-term and t = 5s for long-term segments, they are used to train encoders for each time scale during pre-training, with long-and shortterm feature extraction performed during fine-tuning. Data augmentation included scaling the samples with factors from [0.7, 0.8] and [1.2, 1.3], and adding Gaussian noise with zero mean to ensure an SNR of 5dB.\n\nTo optimize the contrastive learning model, we set the number of training epochs to 500, used the Adam optimizer  [54] , and applied a cosine annealing learning rate scheduler with triple cyclic warm restarts  [55] . The initial learning rate was set to 0.0001. During fine-tuning, the emotion classification task is simpler than feature extraction. To preserve the pretrained features and avoid overfitting on the small dataset, we set the number of epochs to 15, initial learning rate to 0.001, and batch size to 256, based on empirical observations.

Fig.  5  shows the confusion matrices of our model on the DEAP and DREAMER datasets, demonstrating its ability to distinguish emotional states. Higher accuracy is observed in both arousal and valence dimensions for high values, typically linked to discrete positive emotions like happiness and excitement. These emotions correspond to distinct physiological signals-such as increased heart rate, skin con-   ductance, and brain activity-making them easier to recognize. When combining arousal and valence into four categories, the best performance occurs in the high valence/high arousal group for both datasets, consistent with previous binary classification results.\n\nTo demonstrate the model's classification ability, we applied t-SNE for dimensionality reduction to compare raw features and features after training (see Fig.  6 ). The trained features show significantly improved separation between emotion categories, with clear clustering across all dimensions. This indicates enhanced feature extraction and classification performance, allowing the model to better capture and distinguish latent emotional patterns. Additionally, the trained features exhibit a continuous band-like distribution, reflecting the smoothness of emotion labels-that is, their gradual changes over time. Although labels are binarized for classification, this pattern shows the model captures underlying temporal dynamics beyond discrete categories.\n\nTo further demonstrate the convergence and stability of the model during pre-training, we plot the training and validation loss curves for both 1-second and 5-second windows in Fig.  7 .

This increases the challenge of contrastive learning through more refined sample pairing. As shown in Table VIII (Our* means that our method does not use data augmentation), our construction method better helps the model distinguish between different emotional categories. Specifically, accuracy and F1 scores improved by 0.34% and 1.54% in arousal, 0.38% and 1.35% in valence, while corresponding standard deviations decreased by 0.06 ∼ 0.41 and 0.21 ∼ 0.37, respectively. Our intra-trial negative pairing surpasses CLISA by learning fine-grained within-subject emotional differences, boosting robustness and discriminability.",

The decision-level fusion combines the final outputs of the classification head, while other methods perform fusion on the features extracted by the encoder. The results show that our fusion method outperforms others in terms of performance. By assigning a weight to each modality based on its maximum class probability before fusion, our method ensures an appropriate contribution from each modality, enabling the model to prioritize the most informative signals while still considering all modalities.",

This issue is largely attributed to the limited number of subjects and data in the datasets. Although we included cross-subject experimental results, a detailed analysis was not performed in this work. In future studies, we plan to explore this setting more thoroughly as an important research direction. In addition, our current model only supports fusion of two modalities. In future work, we will explore fusion of multiple modalities to better integrate complementary information from other physiological signals.",

      "text": "In this paper, inspired by physiological synchronization, we propose a contrastive learning framework for emotion recognition, achieving competitive results on the DEAP and DREAMER datasets. By integrating intra-modal temporal contrastive learning (TCL) and cross-modal contrastive learning (CM-CL), we make preliminary attempts at achieving physiological synchronization across both subjects and modalities. Additionally, we found that a 5-second time window performed optimally when using a single time resolution feature. However, as emotions are characterized by both instantaneous and subtle changes, further extraction and fusion of long-term and short-term features from different time resolutions have led to even better results. Experiments show that, although EEG signals generally perform well in emotion recognition, a reasonable and effective combination with peripheral physiological signals can lead to even better results. Physiological signals are typically multi-channel, with spatial relationships between channels that our model has not yet fully exploited. Therefore, in addition to improving the cross-subject experiments and exploring fusion of multiple modalities, future research will focus on better exploring and utilizing these spatial relationships to further enhance model performance.",
