      "text": "Emotion recognition using multimodal physiological signals is increasingly essential for building personalized, context-aware affective computing systems. Advances in multimodal learning have enabled integration of diverse physiological and behavioral cues such as eye gaze, pupil dilation, facial action units (AUs), and galvanic skin response (GSR) to improve emotion classification accuracy  [1, 9, 12, 38] . Moreover, incorporating contextual information in the form of stimulus-level emotion (Stim Emo) has proven effective at disambiguating subtle physiological patterns, enhancing both valence and arousal recognition  [28, 30, 33, 40] .\n\nContemporary affective neuroscience is guided by the Theory of Constructed Emotion (TCE)  [4] , which conceptualizes affective experiences as arising from a dynamic interplay between low-level core affect (valence and arousal) and higher-level conceptualization mediated by executive attention. Informed by TCE, MuMTAffect structures its pipeline so that modality-specific transformer encoders capture core-affect fluctuations, while a fusion transformer followed by task-specific attention layers implements the conceptual categorization stage, grounding model decisions in a neuroscientifically plausible framework.\n\nNevertheless, inter-individual variability in physiological responses remains a major challenge. Stable user traits such as personality captured by the Big Five dimensions modulate how emotion manifests physiologically  [18, 22, 44, 45] . Prior work has treated personality prediction and emotion recognition as separate tasks  [5, 13] , foregoing the opportunity for joint learning to yield richer, personalized embeddings.\n\nTo address these gaps, we propose MuMTAffect, a Multimodal Multitask Affective Embedding Network (see Figure  2 ) that simultaneously performs emotion classification and personality trait regression from synchronized physiological streams. Separate transformer based encoders for each modality (eye gaze, pupil dilation, facial AUs, and GSR) extract modality-specific temporal features  [35, 41] , which are then integrated by a fusion transformer to model cross-modal interactions. A task-specific attention mechanism disentangles core-affect (emotion) from trait-related (personality) representations, while auxiliary personality prediction guides the learning of user-specific affective embeddings.\n\nWe validate MuMTAffect on the AFFEC dataset  [15] , containing 5,356 trials of synchronized multimodal recordings from 73 participants. An extensive preprocessing pipeline yields fixed-length (400 timepoint) sequences enriched with trial-level summary statistics. Our experiments demonstrate that incorporating Stim Emo and GSR strongly boosts arousal F1, while eye-tracking modalities (gaze and pupil) enhance valence discrimination. Personality regression yields a high 𝑅 2 for known users and provides a valuable auxiliary signal that improves emotion recognition, though full generalization to unseen subjects remains an open challenge  [46] .\n\nOur Contributions are as follows:\n\n• We introduce MuMTAffect, a unified multimodal multitask framework grounded in the Theory of Constructed Emotion, capable of jointly predicting emotions and personality traits from physiological data. • We design modality-specific transformers that encode core affect, a fusion transformer that implements TCE-style conceptualization, and task-specific attention for disentangling affect and trait representations. • We develop a comprehensive preprocessing pipeline for the AFFEC dataset, producing synchronized, fixed-length multimodal trials with rich summary features. • We show that auxiliary personality prediction enhances emotion recognition performance, particularly under missing modality conditions, via personalized affective embeddings. • We conduct ablation studies quantifying each modality's contribution and the benefits of including Stim Emo, providing insights for scalable, context-aware affective computing systems.\n\nThe remainder of this paper reviews related work, describes our dataset processing, details the MuMTAffect architecture, presents experimental results, and concludes with discussions on limitations and future directions.",

      "text": "Affective computing aims to enable machines to recognize and respond to human emotions  [32] . Early approaches focused primarily on observable cues such as facial expressions and vocal tones. However, researchers have increasingly turned to physiological signals such as EEG, ECG, EMG, respiration, and GSR as these involuntary responses provide a more objective and less easily manipulated measure of affective states  [21] . These signals can reveal genuine emotional reactions even when individuals attempt to mask their feelings  [21] .\n\nRecent work has broadened emotion recognition by incorporating behavioral cues like eye tracking and facial action units (AUs) alongside traditional peripheral measures. For example, the multimodal benchmark by Soleymani et al.  [36]  combined facial videos (for AU and gaze analysis) with ECG, GSR, respiration, and skin temperature, illustrating the potential of fusing external and internal cues  [19, 37] . Advances in wearable sensors and deep learning have spurred the development of methods that employ 3D CNNs, hypercomplex networks (PHNN), and attention mechanisms to extract shared and complementary features from diverse signals  [17, 27, 43] . More recently, Transformer-based methods have also been applied to multimodal emotion recognition  [35, 41] , demonstrating improved fusion of complex biosignals such as eye gaze, GSR, and EEG.",

      "text": "Despite progress, reliably inferring emotions remains challenging due to the inherent complexity and variability of human affect. Physiological responses vary widely due to factors such as context, environmental conditions, personal history, and cultural background  [20, 21] . For instance, the same level of physiological arousal may correspond to excitement in one context and anxiety in another. Similarly, subjective labeling inconsistencies further complicate the task. These challenges have motivated efforts to incorporate external context as a secondary source of information, with the aim of enhancing emotion recognition accuracy  [26, 28, 33] .\n\nAdditional complexities arise in specific subfields such as speech emotion recognition (SER) and facial emotion recognition (FER), where cultural biases, language differences, and varied annotation practices can lead to inconsistent performance. This underscores the need for robust, adaptable methods capable of handling a wide range of real-world conditions. Recent efforts have also highlighted the importance of benchmarking and evaluating models under noisy or less-controlled environments  [2, 7, 31] .",

In this context, stimulus-level emotional cues (referred to as Stim Emo) have emerged as an effective additional channel, providing contextual grounding that enriches the interpretation of physiological signals  [28, 30, 42] . Fusion strategies, whether early, intermediate, or late, have been explored extensively. Early fusion methods capture cross-modal correlations but often result in high-dimensional representations, whereas late fusion aggregates decisions from modality-specific classifiers but may miss inter-modal interactions. Recent approaches favor intermediate fusion with attention-based or hypergraph-based mechanisms to adaptively weight different modalities  [3, 8, 25, 39, 47] . For example, Koelstra et al.  [19]  fused EEG with peripheral signals to predict valence and arousal, and Iacono and Khan  [14]  achieved state-ofthe-art performance on the SEED-V dataset by combining EEG and eye-tracking features using CNNs.",

Classifiers that perform well on subjects seen during training often experience substantial performance drops on unseen individuals due to differences in baseline states and emotional reactivity  [21] . Approaches such as data normalization, transfer learning, and domain adaptation have been proposed to mitigate these issues  [6] . Moreover, incorporating person-specific traits, such as those captured by the Big Five personality dimensions, can enhance emotion recognition by providing stable user-specific embeddings  [10, 18, 37, 40, 47] . In addition, demographic attributes such as gender can further modulate emotional expression  [45] , underscoring the need for personalized approaches  [46] . Recent multitask learning frameworks have leveraged personality as auxiliary tasks to refine shared representations, thereby improving both emotion prediction and user-specific modeling  [5, 13, 23, 29] .",

      "section_name": "Limitations Of Existing Methods And Our Contributions",
      "text": "Despite these advances, current multimodal approaches have several limitations:\n\n• Insufficient Context Integration: Many methods do not fully incorporate external context, limiting their ability to disambiguate subtle physiological variations. • Limited Personalization: User-specific traits are often handled through simple normalization rather than through explicit auxiliary tasks or learned embeddings, which restricts the ability to adapt to individual differences. • Fragmented Multitask Designs: Most existing works treat emotion recognition and auxiliary tasks (such as personality prediction) separately, missing the benefits of joint, end-toend learning.\n\nOur proposed method addresses these limitations by integrating stimulus-level emotional cues (Stim Emo) and by explicitly modeling personality as auxiliary tasks within a unified, end-to-end deep learning framework. This approach not only enhances emotion recognition through better context integration but also improves personalization by learning robust user-specific embeddings. By combining these strategies with multimodal fusion of Eye, Pupil, AU, and GSR signals, our method overcomes key challenges in generalizing to unseen subjects and in capturing the complex interrelations among physiological, behavioral, and contextual factors.\n\nIn summary, while previous multimodal methods have achieved promising results by leveraging diverse signals and fusion strategies, they often fall short in integrating context and personalizing models for individual differences. Our work builds upon this foundation by providing a holistic, multitask framework that simultaneously captures emotional and personality cues to deliver a more robust and personalized affective computing system  [11, 24] .",
