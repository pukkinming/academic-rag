      "text": "Understanding the neural correlates of emotion has traditionally relied on neuroimaging modalities such as electroencephalography (EEG) and functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI)  [1] [2] [3] . These techniques have revealed the involvement of regions like the amygdala, insula, anterior cingulate cortex, and prefrontal cortex across different emotional states  [4] . Metaanalyses of neuroimaging studies have consistently identified these key regions across diverse emotional paradigms, with the amygdala showing particular importance for threat detection and fear processing  [5] , while the anterior cingulate cortex and insula demonstrate critical roles in emotional awareness and interoceptive processing  [6, 7] . However, traditional neuroimaging approaches face significant limitations, including high costs, restricted accessibility, controlled laboratory requirements, and limited ecological validity when studying naturalistic emotional expression  [8, 9] . The increasing availability of digital text data presents unprecedented opportunities for emotionbrain mapping that could overcome these existing constraints.\n\nCaucheteux et al.  [10]  demonstrated that large language model (LLM) embeddings align with human brain activity without fine-tuning, showing that pre-trained language models inherently capture aspects of neural language representations. This foundational work was extended by Toneva et al.  [11] , who introduced the concept of brain embeddings, highlighting the geometric alignment between the representational spaces of LLMs and brain activity during reading and listening tasks.\n\nFurther evidence of this alignment comes from Schrimpf et al.  [12] , who showed that artificial neural networks, especially transformer-based architectures as used in LLMs, can predict human neural responses to language with remarkable accuracy. These findings collectively support the feasibility of leveraging LLM-derived embeddings to model brain activity, suggesting that the semantic representations learned by these models may reflect fundamental aspects of how the human brain processes language and emotion.\n\nParallel efforts have explored mapping emotional text representations to neuro-biological substrates. Tomasino et al.  [13]  developed a cognitiveaffective framework demonstrating how emotionally charged linguistic input recruits distinct neural systems, while Chen et al.  [14]  correlated sentiment analysis outputs with fMRI patterns, confirming the brain's differentiation of emotional valence during narrative comprehension. These studies build upon earlier work demonstrating that emotional processing involves distributed neural networks, with positive emotions preferentially engaging left prefrontal regions and negative emotions showing stronger right hemisphere activation  [15] . Zhou et al.  [16]  extended this work by associating semantic embeddings from emotional narratives with fMRI-derived brain states, particularly noting strong alignment in medial prefrontal and temporal regions. Similarly, Xiao et al.  [17]  applied unsupervised clustering on emotion-labeled text to uncover latent emotional dimensions and correlated them with EEG and fMRI features. These computational approaches align with neuroimaging meta-analyses showing that different emotional categories activate distinct but overlapping brain networks, with cognitive emotions recruiting prefrontal cortical areas  [18, 19] .\n\nThe utility of natural text has been further emphasized by Hoemann et al.  [20] , who highlighted the value of social media and dialogue data for studying emotion in real-world contexts. Their findings support using large-scale spontaneous language datasets to infer affective brain states, moving beyond the artificial constraints of laboratory-based emotion elicitation paradigms. This approach is particularly relevant given further research showing that naturalistic emotional expression differs significantly from laboratory-induced emotions in both linguistic patterns and associated neural activity  [20] . Despite these advances, existing studies have not established a fully computational, imaging-free method that directly links textual emotional content to specific neuro-anatomical regions. Current approaches typically require either controlled laboratory settings that limit validity, or a focus on general emotional dimensions rather than specific brain region mapping  [8] .\n\nThis represents a significant gap in our ability to study emotional processing at scale. The motivation for developing a purely computational emotionbrain mapping framework, therefore, stems from several converging factors. First, the exponential growth of digital text data offers an unprecedented window into human emotional expression in naturalistic contexts  [20] . Second, advances in semantic embedding technologies have created powerful tools for capturing nuanced relationships between language, meaning, and affective content. Third, decades of neuroimaging research have established a robust understanding of the neuro-anatomical basis of emotion processing, with meta-analytic evidence highlighting key neural circuits involved in emotional regulation and expression  [18, 21] .\n\nThe theoretical foundation of our proposed approach rests on the principle that emotional expression in language reflects underlying neural processes. This hypothesis is supported by evidence showing that the human brain encodes language through distributed, continuous representations  [22] [23] [24] . Studies have demonstrated a direct alignment between high-dimensional language model embeddings and neural activation patterns in languageprocessing regions  [23] [24] [25] .\n\nRecent work by Goldstein et al.  [26]  further established that simple linear encoding models can reliably map language model embeddings onto brain activity during natural conversation, achieving robust correlations with recorded signals. Their findings showed that deep embeddings consistently outperform traditional symbolic linguistic features (e.g., phonemes, syntactic categories) in predicting neural responses across cortical regions, suggesting that highdimensional continuous representations more faithfully reflect the brains internal language mechanisms. Importantly, they also revealed individual and regional differences in neuralembedding alignment, underscoring the capacity of computational models to capture variability in neural organization that extends beyond region-specific specialization. Such evidence not only validates embedding-based approaches for brain-language mapping but also provides a methodological and theoretical foundation for extending this framework to emotion, where capturing both shared and individual patterns of neural processing is particularly critical. Furthermore, individuals with certain mental health conditions may exhibit distinct language patterns, including variations in word choice, emotional tone, and syntactic complexity that correlate with well-documented neurobiological abnormalities  [8, [27] [28] [29] [30] [31] [32] . Extending this perspective, characteristic language patterns in clinical populations may manifest as distinct clusters within embedding space, reflecting altered cognitive and affective processing  [31, [33] [34] [35] . If these deviations also correspond to measurable shifts in brain activation, embedding-based models could offer novel insights into brain-language relationships and help inform computational mental health diagnostics.\n\nBeyond clinical contexts, this framework could further support advanced applications in areas such as LLM-generated text detection  [36] , where subtle differences in linguistic patterns, coherence, and semantic clustering could indicate non-human authorship.\n\nThis study, therefore, investigates whether it is possible to computationally map natural language emotional expressions directly to brain regions without neuroimaging data, using semantic embeddings and clustering techniques to bridge text analysis with neuro-anatomical mapping. Specifically, we aim to:\n\n• Develop a novel computational framework that transforms textual emotional content into neuro-anatomically plausible brain region activations using state-of-the-art natural language processing embedding techniques.\n\n• Validate the clinical utility of this approach by demonstrating its ability to differentiate between healthy and depressed populations through distinct emotional brain mapping patterns, building on established neuroimaging differences in depression.\n\n• Demonstrate discrete emotion localization by mapping specific emotional states to neuro-anatomically appropriate brain regions with high spatial specificity, consistent with established emotion-brain mapping literature.\n\n• Provide an objective, brain-based measure of human-likeness in language by comparing LLM-generated and human-authored texts through their inferred emotional brain activation patterns.\n\nBy providing a cost-effective, scalable alternative to traditional neuroimaging methods, such a computational approach can open new avenues for understanding the neural basis of human emotional communication in digital environments, while maintaining the ability to generate interpretable, neuroanatomically grounded predictions from textual data alone.",

These regions were selected to span key nodes of the emotional circuitry and included limbic structures, prefrontal regions, subcortical structures, temporal regions, and brain stem nuclei, along with anterior and posterior cingulate cortex and medial prefrontal cortex.\n\nThe mapping process utilized a greedy assignment algorithm where cluster centers were sequentially matched to their nearest available brain regions.\n\nFor each cluster center, distances to all anatomical regions were calculated and sorted in ascending order. The cluster was then assigned to the closest region that had not yet been claimed by another cluster, with this constraint preventing multiple clusters from mapping to the same anatomical location.\n\nThis sequential assignment continued until all clusters were mapped to unique brain regions, ensuring that the spatial distribution of emotional content in the 3D space corresponded meaningfully to the anatomical organization of emotion-processing brain networks.

      "text": "Emotion mapping results from the first experiment performed on the DIAC-WOZ dataset  [37]  that comprises annotated interview transcripts from individuals diagnosed with depression and healthy controls revealed notable differences in neural activations between healthy individuals and those with depression (Figure  4 ). The analysis shows distinct activation profiles across different brain regions (as categorized in Table  2 ) when comparing healthy to depressed subjects. For the healthy individuals, activations were observed across multiple brain regions, with particularly strong responses in two key areas. The insula (located in the cortical region)  [6, 53, 54]  and raphe nuclei (located in subcortical region)  [55] [56] [57]  showed the highest activation levels that were statistically significant.  Statistical significance tests were performed using the Mann-Whitney U test as detailed in Table  3 , showing statistically significant differences for the insula left  [58, 59]  and raphe nuclei  [60, 61]  regions.\n\nThe broader analysis by brain system categories (Table  2 ) revealed systematic differences in activation patterns. Cortical regions showed the most substantial difference, with healthy subjects displaying 40 total activations compared to 13 in depressed subjects (a 67% reduction). Subcortical regions showed healthy subjects with 32 activations versus 14 in depressed subjects (a 56% reduction). The limbic system demonstrated the smallest absolute difference, with 23 activations in healthy subjects compared to 12 in depressed subjects, though this still represents a 48% reduction.\n\nThe particularly pronounced reductions in cortical and subcortical activation suggest that depression affects both higher-order cognitive-emotional pro-cessing (cortical) and fundamental emotional response systems (subcortical). Large-scale comparative studies have found that gray matter volume reductions in the insula and hippocampus represent common features across major psychiatric disorders, including depression  [62] [63] [64] . Reduced hippocampal gray matter volume is a common feature of patients with major depression, bipolar disorder, and schizophrenia spectrum disorders  [28] .\n\nFigure  5  presents 3D cortical surface renderings in MNI space, comparing healthy (left) and depressed (right) groups. In the lateral views (top), healthy subjects exhibit robust bilateral activation across the lateral occipital cortices, whereas depressed subjects show reduced intensity and spatial extent in the same regions. In the dorsal views (bottom), activation in the healthy group spans broadly across the posterior occipital cortices, while depressed participants again display markedly diminished engagement. This pattern points to altered visual processing network function in depression, consistent with prior reports of occipital cortical abnormalities, including disrupted dynamics at rest and altered connectivity with emotion-regulation systems  [65] [66] [67] . The multi-trial validation analysis (discussed in section 2.8) revealed a systematic difference in emotional response patterns between groups (Table  4 ). Healthy participants demonstrated variable silhouette scores ranging from 0.20 -0.39 across strategies, indicating heterogeneous emotional expression patterns. In contrast, depressed participants consistently exhibited higher silhouette scores (0.27 -0.89), suggesting homogeneous, constrained emotional response patterns.\n\nThe highlighted regions in Table  4  were selected based on three convergent criteria: i) highest clustering quality ratios, ii) established roles in depression pathophysiology, and iii) representation of distinct functional brain systems. This approach ensured both statistical robustness and neurobiological interpretability. The clustering quality ratio (depressed vs. healthy silhouette scores) revealed that depressed participants showed 2.2 -2.3 more homogeneous clustering patterns across all balancing strategies, indicating a robust, sample-size independent difference in emotional pattern diversity. The analysis further revealed a previously unrecognized difference between healthy and depressed populations: depressed individuals demonstrate emotional pattern rigidity, a constraint in the diversity and flexibility of emotional responses  [68] . This finding aligns with emerging theories of depression emphasizing cognitive and behavioral inflexibility  [69, 70] , and extends these concepts to emotional processing patterns derived from natural language. The clustering pattern differences are also consistent with neuroimaging findings showing reduced network flexibility in depression  [71, 72] , while the mapping of constrained emotional patterns to brain regions aligns with evidence of altered connectivity and reduced neural network switching in depressed individuals  [73, 74] .\n\nThe high silhouette scores in the depressed group suggest stereotyped, predictable emotional expressions, while the variable clustering in healthy participants indicates adaptive emotional flexibility: the ability to express emo-tions across a broader range of patterns depending on context  [75] . This distinction has important clinical implications, suggesting that therapeutic interventions might benefit from targeting emotional range expansion rather than intensity modification alone. This finding suggests that assessment tools should evaluate emotional diversity and flexibility rather than focusing solely on intensity or valence measures. Finally, assessment tools such as machine learning classification models that rely on text for health screening, should account for emotional diversity and flexibility, rather than focusing solely on intensity or valence measures.",

      "text": "The second experiment was performed on the GoEmotions dataset  [38] , which includes 58,000 Reddit  [39]  comments manually labeled into 27 emotion categories (or neutral). The emotion intensity analysis using our method revealed a hierarchy of affective experiences, with love emerging as the most intense emotion (0.709), followed by joy (0.593) and relief (0.560). Negative emotions like sadness (0.486), fear (0.412), and anger (0.390) occupy middle-intensity positions. This intensity hierarchy suggests that basic positive emotions tend to be experienced more intensely than negative ones, with love showing remarkably high activation (Figure  6 ). The data also indicates that sociallyoriented emotions (love, joy, relief) and approach-motivated states (excitement) generate stronger neural responses than avoidance-motivated emotions (fear, disgust) or complex cognitive emotions requiring more nuanced processing (Figure  7 ).  These findings align with established emotion research, particularly regarding the valence-arousal relationship  [76] . Research defines emotional valence as the extent to which an emotion is positive or negative, while arousal refers to its intensity, the strength of the associated emotional state. The results supports the general principle that negative words tend to have higher arousal values and are perceived with higher intensity than positive words  [9] , while also showing positive emotions like love and joy to be at the top of the intensity scale.\n\nThe high intensity of love is particularly well-supported by neuroimaging research. Meta-analyses have found that love recruits brain regions that mediate motivation, emotion, social cognition, and self-representation, including the ventral tegmental area, caudate nucleus, anterior cingulate gyrus, and middle frontal gyrus  [77] . Further studies showed that positive emotions connect the prefrontal cortex to the nucleus accumbens, while negative emotions connect the nucleus accumbens to the amygdala  [28] , suggesting different neural pathways that could explain intensity differences.\n\nThe positioning of joy as the second-highest intensity emotion is consistent with neuroscience research showing that the left prefrontal cortex is particularly associated with positive emotions including joy, with increased activity in the left prefrontal cortex correlated with positive emotional states  [15] . Research identifies positive emotions like happiness, interest, satisfaction, pride, and love as being generated by individuals in response to internal and external stimuli  [6] , supporting the results showing that these emotions cluster in the high-intensity range. The relatively low intensity of cognitive emotions aligns with research suggesting these require more complex processing  [78] , but the moderate intensity of fear (0.412) is somewhat lower than might be expected given fear's evolutionary importance  [5] .",

Comparing human conversational texts with LLM-generated responses revealed systematic divergences in neural activation profiles across limbic, cortical, and brainstem regions.  Statistical significance tests (Table  5 ) using the Mann-Whitney U test showed significant statistical differences between human-authored text and the subsequent LLM-generated responses. Humans demonstrated stronger recruitment of emotion-related regions, including bilateral amygdalae  [79, 80] , as well as memory-related structures such as the left hippocampus, consistent with reliance on autobiographical retrieval during dialogue  [81] . The human text also showed greater engagement of reward and arousal-related circuits, including the ventral tegmental area, raphe nuclei, and locus coeruleus, reflecting dopaminergic and serotonergic modulation of motivation and adaptive arousal  [82, 83] . Increased activity in medial prefrontal cortex, posterior cingulate, and temporal poles further supports integration of self-referential and affective context into human conversation  [84, 85] .\n\nIn contrast, LLM-generated responses showed anterior cingulate activity bilaterally, aligning with its role in monitoring and conflict regulation  [49, 86] . LLMs also engaged the right hippocampus more strongly, suggesting an episodic-associative rather than autobiographical memory profile  [81] . Cortical valuation and decision-making appeared lateralized, with left orbitofrontal cortex stronger in LLMs, while right orbitofrontal cortex was greater in humans  [87, 88] . Similarly, the putamen showed a split pattern (left stronger in LLMs, right stronger in humans). The superior temporal gyri was not stronger in LLMs. Instead, the left was more active in humans, consistent with its role in speech and semantic processing  [89, 90] . Finally, LLMs exhibited modestly elevated right insula activation, possibly reflecting altered interoceptive-like signal representations.\n\nTogether, these findings indicate that humans preferentially engage limbic brainstem networks integrating affect, memory, and motivation into language use, whereas LLMs display a bias toward cingulate, orbitofrontal, and striatal pathways associated with conflict monitoring and associative sequencing. This dissociation is consistent with recent work contrasting artificial and biological language networks  [10, 11] .\n\nOur proposed approach therefore shows promise in distinguishing humanauthored text from LLM-generated content, supporting recent studies  [29] [30] [31] [32]  that have demonstrated the potential of computational approaches in analyzing text to predict and classify various characteristics. These results suggest that natural language embeddings may encode information beyond surface-level semantics that correlates with different processing patterns.",

      "section_name": "Study Limitations",
      "text": "Several important limitations must be acknowledged. Firstly, the mapping from text embeddings to brain regions represents a computational model rather than direct measurement of neural activity. Recent advances in computational neuroscience have demonstrated the feasibility of embedding-tobrain mappings: for example, Goldstein et al.  [26]  established that linear encoding models can effectively predict neural activity from high-dimensional text embeddings, achieving correlations up to 0.50 with actual neural signals during natural conversations. While this provides methodological support for computational approaches, our study does not directly validate these mappings against neuroimaging data.\n\nSecondly, although brain signals from fMRI and EEG can be decoded into coherent text  [91] [92] [93] , the inverse problem of predicting potentially engaged brain regions during language processing based on text input remains largely unexplored and requires careful validation. Goldstein et al.  [26]  highlighted both the promise and the challenge of this approach, demonstrating systematic individual and regional differences in how embedding-based models align with neural activity. These findings underscore the importance of extending our population-level predictions to individual-level validation across different modalities.\n\nFinally, the predefined regional coordinates used in our study, while grounded in established neuroimaging research, represent population averages that may not accurately capture individual neuro-anatomy or the mixed selectivity patterns revealed in prior work  [26] . Future studies should address these limitations by combining embedding-based predictions with direct neuroimaging measures and by accounting for individual variability in brain-language mappings, particularly in atypical or clinical populations.",

Our proposed approach's ability to process natural language and map emotional content onto anatomically defined brain regions opens new possibilities for understanding individual differences in emotional processing, monitoring mental health at scale, and developing personalized interventions.\n\nWhile important limitations exist, the approach offers compelling advantages in terms of cost, accessibility, and ecological validity. Future research should focus on validating the approach against established neuroimaging methods, addressing methodological limitations and exploring novel applications in clinical and research contexts. The integration of this computational approach with traditional neuro-scientific methods has the potential to accelerate our understanding of the neural basis of emotion and contribute to more effective treatments for emotional and psychiatric disorders. To encourage further exploration and application of the proposed approach, the complete source code used in this study is publicly available on GitHub at: https://github.com/xalentis/EmotionBrainMapping.",
