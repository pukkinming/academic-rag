      "text": "Instruction-based speech processing is becoming popular. Studies show that training with multiple tasks boosts performance, but collecting diverse, large-scale tasks and datasets is expensive. Thus, it is highly desirable to design a fundamental task that benefits other downstream tasks. This paper introduces a multi-talker speaking style captioning task to enhance the understanding of speaker and prosodic information. We used large language models to generate descriptions for multitalker speech. Then, we trained our model with pre-training on this captioning task followed by instruction tuning. Evaluation on Dynamic-SUPERB shows our model outperforming the baseline pre-trained only on single-talker tasks, particularly in speaker and emotion recognition. Additionally, tests on a multi-talker QA task reveal that current models struggle with attributes such as gender, pitch, and speaking rate.

      "text": "The advancement of large language models (LLMs) in natural language processing (NLP) has significantly impacted speech processing research  [1] [2] [3] [4] [5] , particularly in developing instruction-based speech models  [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] [11] . Unlike conventional task-specific models trained for fixed tasks, instruction-based models use user prompts to perform various tasks, offering greater flexibility. A key goal is to achieve emergent capabilities for handling unseen tasks effectively, as done in NLP  [12] . LTU-AS  [6]  enhances performance across audio and speech tasks with open-ended question-answering data. SALMONN  [7]  uses ASR and audio captioning, adopting activation tuning to mitigate overfitting. Qwen-Audio  [8]  employs a multi-task framework to enhance general audio understanding. WavLLM  [10]  uses curriculum training, starting with elementary tasks and progressing to more complex ones. DeSTA  [11]  learns speech-text alignment by describing a talker's speaking style before instruction tuning. These models integrate speech features into LLMs, which are responsible for understanding speech and describing them with natural language.\n\nDynamic-SUPERB  [13]  provides a comprehensive set of 55 tasks designed to assess instruction-based speech models, covering dimensions such as content, semantics, and speaker characteristics. Surprisingly, existing models perform poorly in speaker and emotion tasks, showing an insufficient understanding of these aspects 1 . This capability is crucial for tasks like 1 https://github.com/dynamic-superb/dynamic-superb/ blob/main/docs/leaderboard.md speaker verification and emotion recognition, which involve processing multiple talkers or expressive speech, and is essential for developing advanced conversation-related applications. While multi-task training can improve performance, gathering sufficient data for all task types is often costly or infeasible. Alternatively, we aim to investigate whether training models on fundamental tasks can enable them to learn general knowledge benefiting several downstream applications.\n\nIn this paper, we propose a novel task called multi-talker speaking style captioning as a fundamental task to enhance models' general speech understanding capabilities. Speaking style captioning uses natural language to describe how a speaker talks, focusing on speaker-specific and prosodic information rather than content. DeSTA  [11]  is the first model to learn general speech knowledge by pre-training on speaking style captioning tasks, but it only involves single-talker captioning, limiting its potential. Our proposed task aims to describe each speaker's style, including overlapping talkers, making it more challenging. Consequently, we created SPEECHCAPS, the first multi-talker speaking style captioning dataset, synthetically generated from PromptSpeech  [14] . Then, we developed DeSTA+ using a two-stage pre-training approach that extends from single-talker to multi-talker captioning with SPEECH-CAPS, enhancing its understanding of speaker and prosodic information. Evaluation results on Dynamic-SUPERB show that DeSTA+ significantly improves performance in speaker and emotion tasks, achieves state-of-the-art results, and demonstrates competitive performance in content and semantic tasks compared to DeSTA, highlighting the effectiveness of the proposed task as a pre-training approach. Besides, we created a test set in SPEECHCAPS to directly assess models' capabilities in capturing the speaking styles of different talkers. The poor performance of baseline models on this test set reflects their weaknesses in speaker and emotion tasks on Dynamic-SUPERB.",

      "text": "2.1. Dataset: PromptSpeech SPEECHCAPS utilizes data from PromptSpeech, which features a variety of expressive utterances from different speakers, specifically designed for training and evaluating PromptTTS, an expressive text-to-speech (TTS) model. Although the audio files are not publicly available, PromptSpeech provides comprehensive metadata, including transcriptions, biological gender, speaker identity, pitch, speaking rate, energy (loudness), and style prompts. To generate audio, we used a commercial TTS API 2 , which is also used in the official version, to synthesize Table  1 : An example of metadata along with its corresponding description and question-answer pairs generated by GPT-4o. Descriptions are generated only for the training set, and question-answer pairs are generated only for the testing set.\n\n(a) Metadata Speaker 1: { gender: female, emotion: sad, pitch: low, speed: slow, energy: low, start: 0.0, end: 3.744 } Speaker 2: { gender: female, emotion: shouting, pitch: high, speed: medium, energy: medium, start: 1.176, end: 5.106 } Speaker 3: { gender: male, emotion: cheerful, pitch: medium, speed: fast, energy: high, start: 5.562, end: The audio starts with a female speaker expressing sadness, her voice low and slow, conveying sorrow. Overlapping slightly, another female voice interjects, shouting with a high pitch and medium speed, her tone filled with intensity. Following this, a male speaker chimes in, his cheerful and medium-pitched voice moving quickly with high energy, bringing a lively and upbeat atmosphere.\n\n(c) Question-Answer Pairs (Only in testing) Q: Among the 3 speakers in the audio, what is the emotion of the speaker who is first in the sequence? A: sad Q: In this audio, there are 3 speakers. Who, according to their speaking order, speaks at the highest speed? A: 3 (the third) utterances based on the official metadata. This process resulted in approximately 50k utterances for the training set, each spoken by a single talker. We then constructed SPEECHCAPS from PromptSpeech as described in subsequent sections.",

Specifically, Dynamic-SUPERB includes 55 tasks, and each task consists of text instructions, speech, and labels. A model receives both the text instructions and speech as input and then performs the task based on the instructions. Based on the specific speech information involved, these tasks are categorized into six dimensions: (1) content, (2) degradation, (3) paralinguistics, (4) semantics, (5) speaker, and (6) audio.

      "text": "While Dynamic-SUPERB includes a wide range of tasks, it lacks those that directly assess specific prosodic attributes. To address this, we created the SPEECHCAPS test set to evaluate models' understanding of prosodic information. We built the SPEECHCAPS test set from the PromptSpeech test set. Although PromptSpeech provides useful metadata for TTS development, it is not ideal for speech captioning tasks. Figure  1  shows the speaking rate distribution for utterances of a specific speaker in PromptSpeech, with colors indicating the original labels. We observe overlaps in the distributions of speaking rate levels labeled as low, medium, and high, which can cause ambiguity and complicate evaluation. Thus, constructing a unified pipeline to relabel the test data is essential.\n\nTo relabel the PromptSpeech test set, we used Data-Speech  [19]  and SoX  [20]  to calculate speaking rate (phonemes per second), pitch, and energy. These distributions are continuous, and we can define two thresholds to divide each attribute into three categories. However, this also introduces ambiguity for utterances near the thresholds, leading to inconsistent descriptions by different models and complicating evaluation.\n\nTo address this, we implemented a filtering process. For each attribute, we selected data in the lowest 15%, middle 15%, and highest 15%, labeling them as low, medium, and high, respectively. This filtering was applied to all three attributes: pitch, speaking rate, and energy. We retained only the utterances falling into these regions across all attributes. Besides, for pitch, we split utterances by biological gender due to significant differences in pitch distributions between males and females. After filtering, we got 501 utterances for the test set.\n\nEvaluating speaking style captioning during testing is challenging because a model's output may not include descriptions for all speakers or attributes, and descriptions may be inconsistent across different models. To reduce ambiguity, we introduced question-answer (QA) pairs as a simplified form to facilitate evaluation. We devised questions prompting models to identify speakers based on specific attributes. Table  1c  shows an example of question-answering for speaking style captioning. In the question, we ask models to identify the speaker with a particular attribute based on their order or to directly inquire about a specific speaker's emotion. For pitch-related questions, we specify the speaker's biological gender to mitigate the influence of varying pitch distributions across genders. Using this approach, we generated 3813 QA pairs for testing.",

      "text": "For each question in the test sets, a model can generate one of three responses: (1) an irrelevant answer, (2) a question-related but incorrect answer, or (3) a correct answer. The model's ability to follow instructions determines whether it produces irrelevant content (case 1) or a question-relevant answer (cases 2 and 3). Using the first QA pair in Table  1c  as an example, if a model outputs \"the first speaker,\" it is irrelevant (case 1) because the question asks for emotion, not the speaker's order. If the response is \"happy,\" it is question-relevant but incorrect (case 2). While both cases (1) and (  2 ) are incorrect, identifying the reason is crucial. Therefore, we define the instruction-following rate as the proportion of cases (  2 ) and (3) in the model outputs. Using LLMs for evaluation has been widely adopted in NLP  [21] [22] [23] . Here, we use GPT-4o, providing it with a prompt that includes the question and the model-generated response. GPT-4o evaluates whether the output is related to the question.\n\nBy calculating the instruction-following rate, we can eliminate irrelevant outputs and focus on evaluating relevant ones. Exact Match and F1 scores are common metrics in QA but fail to assess semantically similar answers accurately. Thus, we use GPT-4o to check if a model output aligns with the ground truth. We design a prompt that includes the question, its ground truth label, and the model output, and GPT-4o then assesses alignment. We define two types of accuracy: overall accuracy, the percentage of aligned answers in the entire dataset, and conditional accuracy, the percentage of aligned answers among all relevant answers (cases 2 and 3). In the following sections, accuracy refers to overall accuracy unless specified otherwise. We utilized four instruction-based speech models: LTU-AS, SALMONN, Qwen-Audio, and DeSTA. Each model is primarily constructed with a speech encoder and an LLM and trained with parameter-efficient fine-tuning techniques  [24, 25] .\n\nThe speech features serve as soft prompts that provide various speech information for the LLMs. LTU-AS and DeSTA extract speech representations and transcriptions from Whisper  [26] , which are subsequently integrated into LLaMA  [27, 28]  for further reasoning. SALMONN adopts a window-level Q-Former  [29]  to generate soft embeddings that fuse speech and audio representations from Whisper and BEATs  [30] . Qwen-Audio introduces several speech-task-specific tags to encourage knowledge sharing and minimize interference among different tasks. Based on the size of the LLM, SALMONN is categorized into 7B and 13B versions, and we used the 7B version in the experiments.",

To train DeSTA+, we first applied PromptSpeech for single-talker speaking style captioning, followed by SPEECHCAPS for multi-talker speaking style captioning, and used the Dynamic-SUPERB training set for instruction tuning. The only difference between DeSTA and DeSTA+ is the multi-talker speaking style captioning in pretraining. In the multi-talker speaking style captioning stage, we set the learning rate to 1e-4, used a batch size of 12, and trained the model for 5 epochs. All other hyperparameters matched the official DeSTA implementation.",

      "text": "We evaluated the proposed pre-training approach's enhancement of model capabilities across a broader range of tasks beyond speech captioning. Table  2  presents the overall accuracy of the models on Dynamic-SUPERB, using GPT-4o for semantic alignment between model outputs and the ground truth. Due to space constraints, we do not detail all tasks individually. Instead, we categorized accuracy results into the following task categories: (a) content, (b) degradation, (c) paralinguistics, (d) semantics, and (e) speaker. It is important to note that direct comparisons across different dimensions are not feasible due to varying task settings and difficulties. Alternatively, we compare the performance of different models within the same dimension. We begin with performance comparisons among LTU-AS, SALMONN, and Qwen-Audio, then shift to DeSTA and DeSTA+. This is because the DeSTA models used an instruction-tuning dataset closely aligned with Dynamic-SUPERB, which could bias comparisons.\n\nFrom Table  2 , we see that among LTU-AS, SALMONN, and Qwen-Audio, no single model dominated all dimensions, and each had distinct strengths. Qwen-Audio excelled in content tasks, outperforming LTU-AS and SALMONN, and showed moderate performance in other dimensions except paralinguistics. LTU-AS, while lagging in content and semantic tasks, was competitive in degradation and speaker tasks. SALMONN showed superior performance in paralinguistics and semantics but struggled with degradation tasks. The DeSTA models demonstrated superior performance across all dimensions compared to the above three models, likely due to their instruction-tuning dataset being closely aligned with Dynamic-SUPERB. Notably, DeSTA+ significantly outperformed in the speaker dimension, indicating an enhanced understanding of speaker information with the proposed approach. Surprisingly, DeSTA+ also showed improved accuracy in degradation tasks, suggesting that learning from more complex audio scenarios can boost performance across various aspects. For other dimensions, DeSTA+ performed similarly to DeSTA, indicating that the proposed approach did not degrade performance.\n\nTo examine the models' understanding of speaker and prosodic information, we show the performance of speaker verification and emotion recognition in Table  3 . In speaker verification (Table  3a ), LTU-AS and SALMONN achieved high instruction-following rates (over 85%) but their accuracies were close to random guesses (50%). Qwen-Audio had a lower instruction-following rate (50%), impacting its overall accuracy on the task. For emotion recognition (Table  3b ), Qwen-Audio had higher instruction-following rates and accuracy than LTU-AS and SALMONN, but its accuracy was still quite low (around 34%). Conversely, though LTU-AS maintained a following rate of around 60%, its accuracy dropped significantly. These results show that LTU-AS, SALMONN, and Qwen-Audio have poor capabilities in understanding speakers and emotions.\n\nDeSTA and DeSTA+ achieved much higher instructionfollowing rates than the other models. In speaker verification, DeSTA+ outperformed DeSTA by around 10% accuracy, showing its enhanced ability to distinguish different speakers. A similar trend was observed in emotion recognition. DeSTA+ achieved the highest accuracy, demonstrating the effectiveness of the proposed approach. Although the use of instructiontuning datasets brought some bias, DeSTA+'s superior performance over DeSTA justifies the effectiveness of the proposed approach, as no new utterances were introduced in training, and we only combined them to create more complex data.",

      "text": "In addition to Dynamic-SUPERB, we tested models on the SPEECHCAPS test set to assess their understanding of prosodic information more directly. Table  4  shows the performance of each model. There were significant differences in instructionfollowing rates (row (a)). Qwen-Audio achieved the highest following rate (about 80%), while LTU-AS lagged significantly behind. SALMONN and DeSTA had similar rates around 50%, with DeSTA slightly higher. Different instruction-following rates directly impacted performance on the test set. For accurate output, a model must correctly understand the instruction, and a low instruction-following rate leads to lower accuracy. In row (b), all models showed poor overall accuracy, with Qwen-Audio achieving the highest at about 20%, and others lagging significantly. This low performance could result from poor instruction-following or a lack of understanding of speaker and prosodic information. To this end, we introduced conditioned accuracy in row (c), evaluating only instances where instructions were followed correctly. Higher conditioned accuracy means a better understanding of speaker and prosodic information. Although Qwen-Audio had the highest overall accuracy, DeSTA outperformed it in conditioned accuracy by about 5%. This suggests DeSTA better understands speaker and prosodic information, likely because it uses the speech captioning task for pre-training. However, DeSTA's lower instructionfollowing rate led to its lower overall accuracy. Last, DeSTA+ had a dropped instruction-following rate than DeSTA but outperformed in conditioned accuracy, and both surpassed the other three models. This indicates that training with multi-talker data enhanced DeSTA+'s ability to capture speaker and prosodic information, though the different forms of captioning tasks (description in training and QA in testing) impacted its instruction-following capability.",
