Most proponents classify FER in terms of methodology, implementation and analysis; relatively few by its application in education; and none by its users. This paper is concerned primarily with (potential) teacher-users of FER tools for education. It proposes a three-part classification of these teachers, by orientation, condition and preference, based on a classical taxonomy of affective educational objectives, and related theories. It also compiles and organises the types of FER solutions found in or inferred from the literature into technology and applications categories, as a prerequisite for structuring the proposed teacher-user category.

      "text": "The overwhelming bulk of literature about artificial intelligence (AI) in schools is about AI on students. The very idea that there is a question about AI on teachers is largely unexplored. Although the fact is flagrant and undeniable, it may be worth a moment's examination. For instance, since the beginning of the Artificial Intelligence in Education series from Springer's Lecture Notes in Artificial Intelligence, on average, the word \"teacher/s\" counts over nine times less than the word \"student/s\", as if teaching and learning have lost touch with each other.\n\nThere is also no need to prove that the teaching art, unlike the teaching technique, is not supported by mechanistic constancy and ratiocination, but rather by improvisation and sub-rational expedients, which is why education depends upon teachers, not on machines. The art of teaching, like the art of parenting, is one of the most complicated activities human beings do, and, because it involves far more emotions than we realize  [1] , neither humans nor machines can truly be trained for it.\n\nAlthough numerous machines can and do perform teachers' roles in terms of teaching techniques and evaluating student cognition  [2] , existing \"emotional\" machines designed to replicate elements of the teaching art are more like sensory and analytic \"prostheses\" for teachers rather than functional replacements. This paper is concerned with one subset of these teaching artefacts, the AI-based facial emotion recognition tool.\n\nFacial emotion recognition (FER), facial expression recognition, facial affect detection etc. are terms often used interchangeably to refer to a technology or methodology designed to detect sentiment cues from the face. In plain terms, on the one hand, FER amplifies visual details just like a magnifying glass or binocular, and on the other, it acts like a translator, converting facial descriptions from mathematical language into another language. By enhancing human natural ability to recognise and analyse facial characteristics it opens up a wide range of applications such as security, authentication, and emotion detection. Published research discussion on the application of automatic facial emotion recognition in education (henceforth \"FERed\") begun perhaps with  [3] . As when some teachers, though not all, observe their students' facial expressions to formulate a provisional hypothesis of the teaching-learning outcome, so a FER system can \"watch\" the students or recordings of them, collecting and processing facial expression-related data. The technology needed is now already in place, but the standards are not.\n\nThe proposition that an element of a school population should be subjected to FER experimentation without declaring exactly whose efficiency it enhances, with what scope, and by what means, seems insensitive, to say the least, as its critics have pointed out  [4, 5, 6] . By the same token, to criticise FERed without specifying exactly the points of concern, seems futile.\n\nStudies on FER in education, as far as examined by this study, are characterised in terms of technology types and/or applications. This study introduces the category of \"users\" to call due attention to variations in teacher-user types, needs and wants, which it attempts to determine based on established theories in education and cognate sciences. In doing so, it touches on several questions prudently avoided in the literature about FER in education.\n\n2 The student face and learning 2.1 Question #1. What is a \"learning\" face? Some of the most erudite teachers in history, such as Pythagoras and Socrates, are known to have taken student physiognomy very seriously in distinguishing those who can learn from those who cannot  [7] , but no equivalent evidence was found concerning teachers' efforts to identify students who are learning from those who are not. In recognizing, for instance, that someone is in pain, health professionals consider the facial expression a more reliable source of information than a patient's verbal account of the pain  [8] . While the recognition of a \"suffering\" face and that of the \"learning\" face may be related, no studies were found to either define a \"learning\" face, or to ascertain the extent of teachers' reliance on it.\n\nBecause everyone has facial habits and characteristics, one can make better sense of emotions on a learner's face after becoming familiar with the framework of that face and the ways in which that framework is used when learning. A contraction and furrowing of the brow may be: a) a sign that the learner is concentrating, or confused, or angry etc. b) simply a personal habit one needs not explain or apologize for. When a teacher claims to have detected certain emotions on a student's face, credibility largely depends on one's subjective perception of the teacher making the assertion. But when those making the assertion are scientists, their speculations are typically produced in a form which can be mistakenly taken as authoritative.",

      "section_name": "Question #2. What Emotions Are Compatible/Incompatible With Learning?",
      "text": "First, despite the many theoretical propositions suggesting that positive emotions increase the propensity for learning  [9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15] , there is no criterion whereby some emotions are considered conducive to learning and others not. Let us imagine that student X, whose parents are bankrupt, takes a course on banking. While X's emotions may all be negative, the desire to learn in this course may nevertheless be at its apex. By the same logic, student Y, being happily in love, constantly manifests positive emotions but is unable to focus on learning. However crude such examples may be, the duty to recognise and refute convenient categorisation of emotions as \"learning-compatible\" and \"learning-incompatible\" should be assumed. Those who made Pekrun's work one of the most cited sources of confidence in categorical emotions for FERed, may have missed the following words \"simplistic conceptions of negative emotions as bad and positive emotions as being good should be avoided because positive emotions are sometimes detrimental and negative emotions such as anxiety and shame beneficial.\"  [10] .\n\nSecondly, there are criteria by which some emotions are deemed desirable or undesirable in schools. For instance, there is obviously something emotionally wrong with a student crying in school, just as it is inappropriate to burst into laughter during a class, if nothing is amusing. However, unless behavioural correction, psychological therapy etc. are included the education service, educators are not strictly and directly concerned with student conduct, depression, maladjustment etc. Emotions like anger, sadness, shame, fear etc. can greatly motivate learning; frustration, rage, disobedience etc. are not related with ignorance; what may seem boring for some students can be exciting for others; disengagement with one subject or activity may be due to intense engagement with another; and the list of complexities can go on. One only needs to briefly examine the lives of people like Isaac Newton, Marie Curie, Mahatma Gandhi or Albert Einstein to grasp the complexity and intricacy of the connections between emotions, behaviors, and achievements.\n\n2.3 Question #3. How can machines distinguish general emotions from learning-related emotions on student face?\n\nStudent affect can be related either to general emotional state, or to emotional response towards the educational content.\n\nAlthough good practitioners of the teaching art, as  [16]  would call them, may intuitively perceive or infer the difference between the two through subconscious processing of accumulated experiences, there are no known ways of making the distinction between general and particular emotions accessible from a mathematical standpoint so that it can be done by machines.\n\nMany FER proponents suggest that FER-generated feedback on student affect can serve as basis for teachers to implement personalised and/or generalised interventions  [17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22] .  [23]  presupposed that \"academic emotions\", as defined by  [10] , can be recognized on a student's face by a machine, and went on to develop a FER system that reportedly identifies such emotions of students using a model for continuous facial emotional patterns.\n\nThe assumption that academic emotions can automatically be detected has gone as far as to call for facial expression databases focusing on academic emotions. One such example is DAiSEE, reported to have been used in seven studies  [24] . Researchers who work with this assumption seem to equate  [25] 's psychological methods of measuring academic emotions, and differentiating them from general emotions, with mathematical methods of observation and analysis used in FER.\n\nLet us, nevertheless, assume that FEReds can distinguish between general and academic emotions. If FEReds designed to detect only general emotions on each student's face were used by teachers in schools, it follows that teacher-users are both willing and able to adequately respond to FER-generated negative feedback on student affect. In reality, however, the typical teacher is neither trained nor constituted as a mental health professional or as an entertainer. Teachers are concerned only with certain aspects of the personal and intellectual development of their students and, in that role, each student's general emotional state is a datum from which they start. It is neither a teacher's duty to change it, nor reasonable to attempt during teaching hours for it is changeable within measurable time. Teacher intervention to change student general emotions, not only goes beyond the scope of standard education, but may also do more harm than good. Therefore, if FEReds are designed to detect general emotions, then they may be more suitable for categories of users other than teachers.\n\nConversely, if FEReds programmed to detect student emotions related to the educational content before them, it follows that teacher-users can make sense of the feedback received from the machine. Many teachers assume the moral duty to creatively intervene in order to elicit and maintain students' interest, cultivate their innate emotional intelligence etc., in freedom, by trial and error, not in textbook fashion or by imposition. Such teachers may find useful a FERed that offers insight into student emotional responses, provided these are aligned with affective educational objectives that teacher-users themselves are familiar with. The details of these objectives vary with theoretical persuasions, teaching experiences, educational traditions in a teacher's country of origin, the teacher's age etc. All these variations cannot be explored here, but section 3.1. 2 touches on the first of them, giving an account of attributes contained in a classical theory of affective learning behaviour is included in section.\n\nThe considerations above invite efforts attempting to automatically detect student emotions using FER to: a) be guided less than some have been  [23, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34] , by oversimplifications which a machine translates into categories (such as compatible with learning and incompatible with learning) and more by empirical insights directly from education practitioners. b) acknowledge that the distinction between general and education-related emotions can hardly be hoped to formulate as an algorithm; and c) declare in which of the two broad and distinct streams of professional practice, i.e. educational and noneducational, their work lies.",

      "text": "While student cognitive behaviour is considered public matter, the affective one is deemed private. This is one reason why, despite undeniable affective implications of all teaching and learning, typical schools are only preoccupied with the evaluation of cognitive educational objectives (cognitive testing), relegating the evaluation of affective educational objectives (affective testing) to the status of a teacher's hobby, for which there is no responsibility to expend public resources on. Another reason is that, unlike cognition, which is adapted to quantitative analysis, measuring student affective achievement is difficult, whether the method is scientific or not.",

      "text": "Bloom  [35]  brought out the distinction between cognitive and affective domains of educational objectives, pointing to a scale of consciousness on which the latter is positioned lower than the former. Krathwohl's  [36]  affective taxonomy deals with objectives expressed as interest, attitudes, values, appreciation and adjustment, which are tested for using questionnaire strategies. Given the wide meaning of these terms, they were encompassed into ranges of behaviour and ordered into five categories. The lowest level in the affective continuum is characterized by a state in which the student is attentive and passively \"receives\" the teaching. Acceptance is an active state marked in the \"responding\" level. At the third level, the student already pursues the subject or activity. At the fourth and fifth levels, the behaviour is described as attitudes form a structure within a network of values. In the range of meaning, interest can be located between the starting phase of \"1.0 Receiving\" and the middle of \"3.0 Valuing\". Appreciation overlaps with interest to a greater extent than attitudes, values and adjustment, which are marked at higher levels in the taxonomy. Krathwohl et al. do not categorise emotions as more or less conducive to learning, but do remark that behaviour with emotions such as enthusiasm, warmth, disgust, etc. is little at the lowest levels of the taxonomy, but prominent at the middle levels, and decreased towards the top  [36] . Figure  1 , taken from  [36]  depicts where student interest and the other goals are located.  1 Figure  1 : The range of meaning typical of commonly used affective terms measured against the Taxonomy continuum.  [36, p.37]  The original affective taxonomy elaborated by Krathwohl et al. inspired and provoked numerous researchers to produce other such taxonomies  [37, 38, 39]  and related classifications  [40, 41] . Of all the affective taxonomies noted, Krathwohl's remains the most prescriptive and its limitations are thoroughly recognized by the authors. One such limitation is that the objectives expressed in terms of values, attitudes etc. are not well operationalized and thus the taxonomy is recommended for curriculum construction rather than instruction planning. Another limitation stems from the difficulties that authors admit facing when making the distinctions between and among categories. Some critics of Krathwohl's taxonomy pointed out that the concepts used, such as the division of affective activities into \"receiving\" and \"responding\" categories, is strongly based on behaviourism  [42] . Others remarked that Krathwohl's affective taxonomy focuses on internal constructs, which goes against the behaviourist focus on observable behaviours  [43] . Although admittedly too general, abstract and limited in scope, Krathwohl's taxonomy remains the landmark in the affective domain of educational objectives.",

[44] , drawing on the taxonomies of Bloom  [35]  and Krathwohl  [36] , identified three dimensions to student engagement: a) \"behavioural engagement\", which implies that the student is present, attentive, participatory similar with the first phase of Krathwohl's \"1.0 Receiving\" category, where interest may be covert, extrinsic, or passive (such as when a student is: either not necessarily interested in what is being taught, but wishes to make a good impression, obtain praise, high grades, degrees etc.; or ready to become interested in the subject or activity, though not interested yet); b) \"emotional engagement\", characterised by affective reactions like interest, enjoyment, sense of belonging corresponding with Krathwohl's \"2.0 Responding\" and \"3.0 Valuing\" categories, where interest is overt, active and intrinsic (as when a student is more interested in the educational content than in getting good grades); and c) \"cognitive engagement\", describing students invested in learning and willing to go beyond requirements Krathwohl recognizes that the last two categories \"4.0 Organization\" and \"5.0 Characterization by a value complex\" in his affective taxonomy are, at least in part, cognitive (student conceptualizes the value to which he previously responded, and this value is integrated and organized into a value-system which may come to characterize the student as an individual).",

      "text": "John Dewey remarked that interest \"has its emotional as well as its active and objective sides\" and that \"the root idea of the term seems to be that of being engaged, engrossed, or entirely taken up with some activity because of its recognized worth\"  [45] . In other words, to say that a student is \"interested\" means that the student is either engaged, absorbed, or consumed by whatever is that interesting to that student.  [46]  wrote: \"Interest is one indication of emotional engagement\". While Dewey acknowledges that interest may not necessarily imply engagement, Renninger seems to suggest that whenever someone is interested in something, emotional engagement is always present. To further complicate matters, one may consider  [47] 's assertion that \"engagement is only possible when interest is present\".\n\nThis study admits that a student can be genuinely interested in something without being actively engaged in it, and does not take into account \"emotional engagement\", which it regards as passive behaviour, likely undetectable and, thus, irrelevant for the intended purpose. It also considers that engagement on the part of a student does not necessarily indicate interest, as it may be when the student's motivation may be extrinsic, rather than intrinsic (i.e. student behaviour may be influenced more or entirely by desires other than learning), a distinction that a machine cannot make. Finally, this study takes  [36] 's view that interest is a primary educational objective, and argues that while genuine interest (marked in Krathwohl's affective continuum by transition from passive to active responses) might be detected using a combination of FER techniques and teacher vigilance, genuine engagement (located past subcategory \"3.3 Commitment\") may not.",

Here, this method is called \"verbal inquiry\" (or \"inquiry\") to contrast it with \"visual detection\" (or \"detection\"), as commonly practiced in fields like psychiatry and criminology.\n\nLogically, there is no need to inquire if something is known, just as it is futile to inquire about something which is not knowable. The method of asking is practical when the subjects are not well known. If the subjects are well known, observation is natural. A distinction can thus be made between: a) \"Detective\" teachers Teachers who know their students very well would not need to ask them questions about their feelings as much as those who just met their students, and are likely to try and detect their students' emotions b) \"Inquisitive\" teachers Teachers who are not (yet) well acquainted with their students may rely less on visual detection and more on asking students for information, which students are, in fact, under no obligation to supply if not willing.",

      "section_name": "Detection Of Student Attention, Interest, Satisfaction And Emotional Intelligence",
      "text": "Four aspects extracted from  [36] 's work are especially relevant in the context of student affect detection: a) Student attention is not an indication of genuine interest in the educational content.\n\nThe \"1.0 Receiving\" category is characterised by an \"extremely passive position or role on the part of the learner\" whereas subcategory \"2.1 Acquiescence in responding\" is considered \"the first level of active responding after the learner has given his attention\". Because many approaches  [26, 30, 33, 48]  to testing student affect, both traditional or AI-based, focus on seeing that each student is attentive or \"receiving\" the teaching, to which the present study adds that receipt does not constitute acceptance. The student may examine the received content at a later time and decide then whether to accept or reject it. Thus, acceptance goes beyond receipt, and it is the prerequisite for any advancement from the \"1.0 Receiving\" level to the level in Krathwohl's taxonomy, which a student reaches after transitioning from a passive to an active stance. Acceptance or refusal is conditioned by manner and time, variables whereby student's affective state can be tracked and measured.\n\nb) Student interest is considered overt emotion, thus detectable only before values become internalised. The range of overt emotions coincides with that of interest, both being commonly observed at the middle levels of the affective continuum, which denotes the probability for detection of a student's interest, or readiness to become interested. While a student's interest may occur in the \"1.0 Receiving\" level (i.e. the student giving passive attention to the subject), emotion is considered covert and undetectable at that level. Emotion decreases as interest becomes internalized, and may not be detected beyond the \"3.0 Valuing\" level. If the idea that interest stops occurring when a student becomes committed to a particular subject seems baffling, it is because, in the affective taxonomy, \"interest\" is understood as a process rather than as an outcome. c) Student satisfaction may or may not be detectable. In Krathwohl's words \"Emotional responses, even those that signify satisfaction and enjoyment, may not necessarily be overtly displayed.\" d) Emotional intelligence is considered covert emotion, thus undetectable Emotional intelligence (according to  [49] , emotional intelligence includes one's ability to control and motivate oneself, zeal and persistence) seems to be located along categories \"4.0 Organization\" and \"5.0 Characterization by a value complex\", which evaluate affective objectives that \"appear to require, at the very least, the ability to (. . . ) comprehend\"  [36] .",

A variety of works on education-related FER solutions can be found in both scholarly and scientific literature, varying, as far as is known, only in terms of technology types and application-related criteria.

Because the technology behind FER is common to all sectors of application, the listing provided here makes no distinction between FER and FERed in terms of the technology available. This categorisation is designed to help non-specialists navigate through existing and emergent types of FER, grouped into: methodology, implementation, analysis and ownership. This kind of categories collectively shape the decisions for applying FER in educational settings, considering the unique requirements and goals of each scenario. Existing FERed-related research, which naturally started from the assumption that there is demand for FER in education, make no allusion to either types of users or user needs. Although users are generally presumed to be teachers, the envisioned model for FER adoption in educational settings is top-down, as if nothing could or should empower teachers to have, by their own accord, a FERed in the classroom. If research on FERed would focus on teachers' demand for detection first, and emotion recognition second, it may avoid being ridiculed as \"a solution in search of a problem\"  [59] , or understood as a imposition from on high that teachers can neither have a say in or refuse. It is a fact that, at least in Japan, education administrators decide on the adoption or rejection of AI in schools often without thorough consideration for, or consultation with teachers  [60] . The problem with the top-down approach is, first, that it takes the focus away from differences between users in general, and teacher-users in particular; and secondly, that it promotes a standardisation process to reduce the number of different FEReds used, in effect, reducing the number of different arts of teaching, instead of acknowledging and supporting teaching practice diversity. This study rejects the top-down FERed adoption preconception as erroneous, and addresses the gaps it created in existing FERed categorisation patterns by proposing a new category (that of \"users\" with focus on \"teacher-users\"), the obscuring of which it plausibly caused.",

The fact that there are few methodological models for this kind of research only adds to the challenge. For the purpose of concluding this investigation and offering further direction for those engaging in a similar undertaking, the approach chosen is categorisation, recognising that the task is not so complex as to defy it.\n\nThe discerning of types is one of the most fundamental branches of knowledge. The method employed here involves engaging with existing literature, and aligns with the approach of incorporating underlying principles and unifying themes while organising and categorising in meaningful ways. It is designed to satisfy the need for systematic and rigorous deduction of pure notions, as well as structured and cohesive categorisation method in scholarship. Extensive literature review aided the identification of relevant criteria, factors and gaps within prior categorisations involving FERed technology and/or FERed applications, to which this study adds FERed users, to advance a classification of FERed teacher-users.\n\nThe previous two categorisations in this study took place when a FER was recognized as belonging to a class based on certain technology-related or application-related criteria. For instance, when a FER is described on the basis of its methodology, a category \"methodology\" is established as the class encompassing FER solutions that share a description by their technological characteristics. Further categorisation allowed for grouping tools that utilize comparable technological frameworks or mechanisms. Similarly, for descriptions of FERed from the viewpoint of FERed applications, another category \"applications\" was formed, representing FER solutions that serve particular educational purposes, organised in subcategories, such as student engagement assessment, student interest detection, student attention surveillance  [33]  etc. Because these were merely a compilation of classes, the majority of which can be found in literature, they seemed more fitting in the sections on literature.\n\nAs noted above, the categorisation approach in this study goes beyond these two stated or implied criteria, to introduce a new category dedicated, in general, to the users of FERed and, in particular, to teacher-users. When tools are sorted into this user-centric category of \"users\", by acknowledging the different users subcategories, such as teachers, education administrators, parents, students themselves, researchers etc., allows one to distinguish tools that cater to different user needs and wants. Finally, the study hones its focus on a single but significant subset within the user subcategories, the teachers, further classifying them based on theoretical traditions in education and related fields.",

At least in the case of educational technology (edtech) for teachers, there are two schools of thought, which vary in shades, but might be classified in this way (as  [62] 's human-vs user-centred framework does not seem to fit):\n\n(1) For creating new (non-human) teachers (e.g. intelligent tutoring systems, adaptive learning platforms, virtual / augmented reality)\n\n(2) For making (human) teachers better (e.g. FER, speech recognition tools, eye tracking systems, data analytics platforms, AI-based assessments)\n\nThe word \"for\" does not necessarily mean \"against\" the other group. FERed is not in the category of educational tools created by ideas belonging to school (1), which may leave nothing for human teachers to do other than act as on-site support  [19, 63] , raising the question of whether they are still \"teachers\". Tools belonging to (1) often do not require a user-centred design, so development can speed past research on users. The ideal of FERed is not only to enhance the teacher's visual and analytical capabilities, but to make the teacher better. FERed belongs in school  (2) , and as such it requires a more direct focus on user types and needs.\n\nFERed \"for teachers\", as some designate it  [29, 32, 64] ), is not necessarily a universal application \"for teachers\", but can and should be related to a specific description of a teacher, or group of teachers. It is a matter of much more than semantic importance, because not having appropriate words whereby to distinguish teachers who are likely to become FERed users from those who are not, has implications on the whole understanding and discussion of the subject. Under the difficulty of expression, some take refuge in teacher quality, and refer to \"good\" teachers, as if there was a universally agreed-upon definition of what a \"good\" teacher might be. In older publications, education scholars  [65, 66]  used some terms of art: a) \"cognitive instructors\" to refer to teachers concerned with the cognitive goals of teaching; b) \"affective instructors\", to refer to teachers concerned with student affective adjustments too.\n\nNo new efforts to word the two types of teachers have been found in more recent literature. This may be, at least in part, due to the \"erosion in the meaning and substance of affective objectives\", which Krathwohl hoped to redress, sped up as the years progressed. A Google Scholar query for \"affective domain\" versus \"cognitive domain\" in A first conclusion that may be drawn from this classification is that, unless persuasion and/or training efforts are invested, teachers in categories A. It is hoped that this long list would serve FERed proponents to improve the quality of their proposals, FERed critics to better assess the implication, and FERed users to formulate more informed opinions and requirements. The result of this micro-investigation supports the previously posited hypothesis that there are teachers (\"cognitive teachers\") who do not need or want to use a FERed. This small finding alone implies that a top-down decision to adopt such technology may hinder teacher autonomy, face resistance, squander resources etc.\n\n2. In the same survey, the following question was also asked: \"As a parent, would you agree to FER monitoring your child's face in class?\" Answer choice: • Yes.\n\n• No. 34 out of 80 teachers answered \"No\".\n\nTeachers who answered \"No\" to this question may justifiably be considered, on the one hand, likely to reject FERed on principle, and on the other, unlikely to assume the responsibility of using FERed in their teaching practice.\n\n3. The same short survey also asked the following question: \"As a teacher would you choose to use FER or would you rather rely on your natural ways of detecting emotions on your students' faces?\" Answer choice:\n\n• Yes, I would use it.\n\n• No, I would rather rely on my natural ways to detect emotion on each student face.\n\n28 out of 80 teachers answered \"No\"",

      "text": "If it is true that every human being has an intellectual appetite, then its discovery is a crucial moment in one's life. If somebody or something could capture that moment, then the appetite may not be lost. Efforts to achieve this on one's own, or with machines that simplify or fulfil this task, should be endorsed. This paper showed that knowledge specific to the field of computer science can be made clear to outsiders in terms of ends (application) and means (technology). It also identified a number of fallacies that have misguided FERed research focus away from teachers. In an attempt to provide remedy, it proposed a categorisation of teacher-users based on teacher orientation, condition and preference, which further classified teacher-users into 96 categories and subcategories, each with its contrasting characteristics.\n\nTeachers and other potential users, can refer to these classification schemes to better understand FER technology and its application in education, as well as determine their user requirements. The proposed \"teacher-users\" category can also enable developers and other proponents to gain a broader view of teachers as FER users. This work may also be of value for reviewers and critics of FERed. One limitation is that the categories presented herein are consistent mainly with one taxonomy of affective educational objectives. Another problem is that, sometimes, speculation and argument do take the place of sound theory and evidence in studies on affective educational objectives, including the ones which have guided this study. Because FER is far from common in schools, and empirical data for analysis is hardly obtainable, this paper could only provide a starting point for understanding the relationship between FERed and (potential) teachers-users.\n\nThe proposed categorisation needs to be tested based on comprehensive coverage of teacher characteristics, case studies, and data on teacher experiences with FER, as they become available. The classification schemes need revision and extension as analytical models of affective educational objectives become more complex and the FER technology advances.",
