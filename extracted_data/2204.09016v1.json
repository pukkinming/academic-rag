      "text": "Electroencephalography (EEG)   based emotion recognition has demonstrated tremendous improvement in recent years. Specifically, numerous domain adaptation (DA) algorithms have been exploited in the past five years to enhance the generalization of emotion recognition models across subjects. The DA methods assume that calibration data (although unlabeled) exists in the target domain (new user). However, this assumption conflicts with the application scenario that the model should be deployed without the time-consuming calibration experiments. We argue that domain generalization (DG) is more reasonable than DA in these applications. DG learns how to generalize to unseen target domains by leveraging knowledge from multiple source domains, which provides a new possibility to train general models. In this paper, we for the first time benchmark state-of-the-art DG algorithms on EEG-based emotion recognition. Since convolutional neural network (CNN), deep brief network (DBN) and multilayer perceptron (MLP) have been proved to be effective emotion recognition models, we use these three models as solid baselines. Experimental results show that DG achieves an accuracy of up to 79.41% on the SEED dataset for recognizing three emotions, indicting the potential of DG in zero-training emotion recognition when multiple sources are available.",

      "text": "Emotion recognition is of great importance for humans in various aspects of daily activities. In human-computer interaction, emotion plays an essential role in fatigue detection and healthcare, and existing studies have confirmed the association between various diseases and emotions  [1] . Human emotions can be detected via facial expression, speech and eye blinking  [2] , etc. However, these methods are always susceptible to subjective influences of the participants, which will affect the accuracy and reliability of the models. Comparatively, recognizing emotions through physiological signals is more objective and reliable. As a bridge between the brain and the computer, brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) allow users to acquire brain signals directly. Invasive BCIs, for example, are prohibitively expensive and need surgery to achieve a better accuracy. On the other hand, non-invasive BCIs using electroencephalography (EEG) are much safer and thus have been commonly employed to collect brain signals  [3] . Typically, feature extraction and classification are employed on the preprocessed EEG data.\n\nNevertheless, the EEG signals acquired from the same subject at the same session can be very biased, and training a general model remains a challenge in EEG-based emotion recognition. In recent years, to tackle this issue, numerous works have applied transfer learning, especially domain adaptation (DA) to transfer knowledge from the labeled source domain (existing subjects) to the unlabeled target domain (new data). For example, Zheng et al. applied transfer component analysis (TCA) to help improve the accuracy in the cross-subject transfer  [4] . Li et al. proposed the multi-source style transfer mapping (MS-STM) for the cross-subject multi-source scenario to reduce the marginal distribution differences  [5] . With the development of deep learning, Li et al. adopted deep adaptation network for crosssubject emotion recognition  [6] . Zheng et al. extended the SEED dataset to SEED-IV with more emotion categories and additional modality of emotion data. They also presented EmotionMeter, which fuses two modalities of EEG data  [7] . Zhao et al. proposed a plug-and-play domain adaptation method for shortening the calibration time while maintaining the accuracy  [8] . Chen et al. focused on the multi-source scenarios in EEG-based emotion recognition and presented MS-MDA  [9] ,  [10]  to take both domain-invariant and domainspecific EEG features into consideration.\n\nMost of the aforementioned works enhanced the performance of the model on the target domain by decreasing the domain shift between the source and target domain. However, the assumption that unlabeled target data exists conflicts with practical application, which does not require additional data acquisition in the target domain. Besides, the cost of training a model using DA for every single target domain is high. Domain generalization (DG), on the other hand, deals with a more challenging setting that several different but related domain(s) are given, and the goal is to learn a zero-training model that can generalize to the unseen test domain  [11] . DG helps extract domain-invariant features by exploiting domain differences across multiple source subjects without acquiring any extra target data. However, there are limited works using DG in EEG-based emotion recognition  [12] . Benchmarking DG methods on EEG-based emotion recognition is necessary to provide insights and references for the community.\n\nIn this paper, we benchmark state-of-the-art DG algorithms on EEG-based emotion recognition, which helps alleviate the differences of multiple domain distributions to achieve better generalization on unseen subjects.

The group DRO leverages prior knowledge of spurious correlations to define groups over the training data and define the uncertainly set in terms of these groups.\n\nMixup: It generates virtual feature-target vectors from real feature-target vectors. The whole Mixup method can be described as\n\n(1) where E represents the empirical risk minimization (ERM)  [15] .

DANN embeds the domain adaptation into the process of learning representation, so that the final classification decisions are made based on features that are both discriminative and invariant to the change of domains. DDC uses an adaption layer along with a domain confusion loss based on maximum mean discrepancy (MMD)  [19]  to automatically learn a representation jointly trained to optimize for classification and domain invariance. The deep CORAL constructs a differentiable loss function that minimizes the difference between source and target correlations.\n\nThe DANN method try to make the two feature distributions as similar as possible and discriminate the two feature distribution at the same time, which can be represented as\n\nwhere θ f denotes the parameters of the feature mapping that maximize the loss of the domain classifier; θ d is the parameter of the domain classifier that minimize the loss of the domain classifier; L y is the loss for label prediction and L d is the loss for domain classification. L i y and L i d denote the corresponding loss function evaluated at the i -th training example.\n\nThe DDC method trains the classifier on the labeled source data through minimizing the distance between the source and target distributions, and a standard distribution distance metric MMD is used, which is defined as\n\nwhere X S denotes the source data and X T denotes the target data, and φ represents a kernel function. The final loss function can be written as\n\nwhere l c (X L , y) denotes classification loss on the available labeled data X L and the ground truth labely, λ is a hyperparameter.\n\nThe deep CORAL defines a CORAL loss:\n\nwhere • 2 F denotes the squared matrix frobenius norm, and C S , C T are generated by the labeled source-domain data and unlabeled target data.

Each subject performed the signal acquisition three times with an interval of one week, and the trial number of each session is 15. The raw data are recorded with an ESI NeuroScan system with 62 channels, and then down-sampled to 200 Hz sampling rate. After that, a band-pass filter between 0-75 Hz was applied to maintain informative bands. There are several kinds of features extracted from raw data in SEED, among them, differential entropy (DE)  [21]  has been proven to be robust and accurate. It should be noticed that for each emotion category, samples should resized into the same shape to facilitate the input of the model. Here we set the input shape to (62, 250, 5) and add 0 to samples that are smaller than this size. Implementation Details. The Adam optimizer is used and the initial learning rate is set to 1e -2. The batch size is set to 32, the model is trained with 50 Epochs with 5e -4 weight decay. For the lambda of Mixup, we simply set to 0.2. The drop factor of RSC is set to 1/3. All the other parameters that are required for DG methods are set to 1 by default.\n\nWe select one subject as the unseen target domain and the remaining domains are divided into training domains and validation domains according to a ratio of 4:1. During the training process, the model with the highest accuracy on the validation domains is saved, and then we apply it to the target domain to compute the accuracy on the target domain. In order to avoid the contingency of the experiment, each subject is selected to be the target domain in turn. The mean value and the variance of the total 15 results are reported.\n\nTo show the effectiveness of our model, we also compare several different baselines: ResNet",

For CNN, it can be seen that with the number of convolutional layers increases, the performance of ResNet series models decreases. As for the MLP models, there is no significant change in performance with increasing number of layers. Besides, all MLP models outperform ResNet series models, which indicates that CNNs may not be the best choice for EEG-based emotion recognition since the input is quite different from images. The results of DBN shows that DBN outperforms ResNet series but not as good as MLPs. Among these results, the highest accuracy is 0.7941 with RSC method using MLP-4 baseline, the best DG method is Mixup with an average The main insufficiency of this work is that we only consider deep learning methods that have been used more often in recent years and do not systematically test the DG algorithms on traditional classifiers such as support vector machines and linear discriminative analysis. When the data amount of source is small, traditional models may have better results. This is the next step of our work plan.",

Besides, all the results show that DG algorithms combined with specific baselines have the ability to achieve prominent effects on EEG-based emotion recognition for new users. The benchmarked DG method seems a promising routine towards zero-training emotion recognition models. It is suitable to the practical scenario of affective BCIs and serves as an inspiration and reference for subsequent works concerning transfer learning.",
