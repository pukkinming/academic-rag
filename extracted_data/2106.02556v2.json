      "text": "The task of classifying emotions within a musical track has received widespread attention within the Music Information Retrieval (MIR) community. Music emotion recognition has traditionally relied on the use of acoustic features, verbal features, and metadata-based filtering. The role of musical prosody remains under-explored despite several studies demonstrating a strong connection between prosody and emotion. In this study, we restrict the input of traditional machine learning algorithms to the features of musical prosody. Furthermore, our proposed approach builds upon the prior by classifying emotions under an expanded emotional taxonomy, using the Geneva Wheel of Emotion. We utilize a methodology for individual data collection from vocalists, and personal ground truth labeling by the artist themselves. We found that traditional machine learning algorithms when limited to the features of musical prosody (1) achieve high accuracies for a single singer, (2) maintain high accuracy when the dataset is expanded to multiple singers, and (3) achieve high accuracies when trained on a reduced subset of the total features.",

      "text": "The work presented in this paper is situated in the intersection between research on emotion for robotics  [1]  and emotional classification research in Music Information Retrieval  [2] . In particular, we focus on the under-explored domain of emotion-driven prosody for human-robot interaction  [3] . Verbal prosody is concerned with elements of speech that are not individual phonetic segments but rather pertain to linguistic functions such as intonation, tone, stress, and rhythm. Similarly, musical prosody is defined as the performer's manipulation of music for certain expressive and coordinating functions  [4] . It has been hypothesized that these expressive functions serve to communicate emotion  [5] .\n\nIn this paper, we explore the relationship between musical prosody and emotion through three research questions. First, are traditional machine learning algorithms able to accurately classify an individual's emotions when trained on only the features of musical prosody? Next, are these models able to generalize to a larger group of vocalists? Finally, which features of musical prosody contribute the most to the classification of emotion?\n\nThe paper is structured as follows, in Section 2, background and motivation are discussed. Section 3 describes the dataset collection, training and testing, the taxonomies used in classification, the feature extraction methodology and analysis of their relevance to emotion, feature aggregation, feature selection, and model generalization. Section 4 presents the experiments: Experiment 1 asks how well can traditional machine learning models classify emotion when limited to inputs of musical prosody, Experiment 2 explores our approach's ability to generalize to a larger population of singers, and Experiment 3 explores the individual contribution to accuracy of each feature via training on reduced subsets of the input vector. Section 5 provides discussion to these results, with particular attention paid to the relationships between emotions and potential future work. Finally, section 6 concludes the paper. A demo via python notebook with audio samples is available online.  1",

      "text": "Emotion classification has been a major focus of research in recent years. Ekman created a discrete categorization that consists of fundamental basic emotions which are the root for more complex emotions  [6] . Another classification model is the Circumplex model proposed by Posner et al which plots emotions on a continuous, two-dimensional scale of valence and arousal  [7] . In this paper, we classify emotions using a model similar to the two-dimensional Circumplex model which is further described in section 3.1.\n\nThere has also been much work done in the field of analyzing emotion from text for tasks such as sentiment analysis. Research on classification of emotion in audio has taken many different approaches. Research into classifying emotions in knocking sounds has found that anger, happiness and sadness could be easily classified from audio alone  [8] . There have been multimodal approaches which use audio in combination with another feature, namely visual facial features  [9]  [10] or text lyrics  [11] . Furthermore, researchers have performed emotional classification from audio in the context of music by analyzing which musical features best convey emotions  [12] . Panda et al. have found a relationship between melodic and dynamic features to a number of specific emotions  [13] . Such features that were used to classify emotion in music, however, cannot be easily generalized to other domains. Prosody has been found by linguists to communicate emotion across various cultures, with patterns of pitch and loudness over time representing different emotions  [14] , and has shown the potential to improve human-robot interaction  [15] [16] [17] . Our approach aims to bridge this gap by analyzing these prosodic features which are fundamental to everyday speech and explore how they can be used to classify emotional driven prosody.\n\nKoo et al. have done work in speech emotion recognition using a combination of MFCC and prosodic features with a GRU model on the IEMOCAP dataset  [18] . We expand upon their work by performing an in-depth analysis of 11 different audio features and their effect on classifying emotion. We also classify emotion beyond spoken language by analyzing prosodic features which better generalize to how humans convey emotion using the new dataset collected, as described in section 3.2.",

The two common approaches to address this challenge are 1. Discrete emotional categorization; and 2. Continuous quantitative metrics of Valence and Arousal (sometimes called Control). We use both approaches with a categorical, as opposed to regression, approach to the latter.\n\nOur models classify emotion under two taxonomies: first we categorize each data point as belonging to one of the twenty emotions located around the Geneva Wheel of Emotion. Then we categorize each data point as belonging to one of the quadrants depicted by the intersection of valance and control by assigning each emotion from the Geneva Wheel of Emotion to its respective quadrant. We abbreviate each of these quadrants as follows: \"High Control Negative Valance\": \"HCN\", \"High Control Positive Valance\": \"HCP\", \"Low Control Negative Valance\": \"LCN\", and \"Low Control Positive Valance\": \"LCP\".

The singers were instructed to sing each phrase between 1 and 20 seconds, and to spend approximately 15 minutes on each emotion, resulting in 4 to 6 hours of recordings per singer annotated with ground-truth labels.\n\nAdditionally, the singers were given the following instructions during their recording session:\n\n1. Do not attempt to control for different intensities for each emotion 2. Sing anything for each phrase that you believe matches the emotion except use words.\n\n3.

All models perform better than twice the accuracy of random guessing, with the linear SVM and Gradient Boosting models achieving the highest accuracies. Further analysis of the confusion matrix of the Gradient Boosting model, shown in Figure  4 , provides information about the classes that are most often confused for one another. The model struggles in distinguishing between Low Control Positive Valance and High Control Positive Valance. This is to say the model can tell that an individual is in a positive mood, but has difficulties distinguishing the Control or Arousal of the emotion.\n\nNext, we examine classification under a single emotion taxonomy for a single singer.

We are unsure of why linear SVMs perform worse during generalization as compared to other models, seeing a drop of 6% in Big 4 taxonomy and a drop of 13% in single emotion taxonomy. This drop could potentially be a limitation in our methodology of only applying a linear kernel to SVM training, as perhaps an RBF or polynomial kernel would be better able to generalize to a larger population.\n\nThe results of this experiment are encouraging to the development of a general model of emotional classification based on musical prosody as accuracy is maintained when  Table  5 .

These results demonstrate the manner in which different humans convey emotions, and what emotions are similarly expressed by different individuals. When conveying relief, all three singers expressed a diminuendo and exhale. Similarly, when conveying fear all three singers expressed a crescendo and more accented tones. On the other hand, there was a high level of variation when conveying pleasure, with many different tone ranges, mouth shapes, etc. being present in the data.\n\nFurthermore, from the confusion matrix in Figure  5 , we can see that the emotion pairs of Hate and Disgust as well as Pleasure and Contentment are the most common emo-tions to be misclassified as one another.
