The tutor adapts to the student's level of understanding and fosters knowledge transfer by generating questions that relate the topic to different domains. This solution has the potential to improve student learning outcomes by providing personalized and adaptive questions that challenge them at their optimal level of difficulty. The feasibility of this solution has been demonstrated through a working prototype developed using Microsoft PowerApps. Additional research could reveal how affective computing principles could be integrated into the system to analyze the emotional valence of the user and how the system could be tuned to meet the specific needs of learners across the ASD spectrum. This solution is novel and offers more comprehensive support to a diverse range of learners than existing AI tutors, such as Quizlet's Q-Chat.

      "text": "Cognitive tutors are computer-based systems that provide individualized instruction and feedback to students based on their cognitive processes and learning goals . They aim to mimic the behavior of human tutors by adapting to the student's needs and preferences. Cognitive tutors have been shown to improve student learning outcomes in various domains, such as mathematics, science, and language  [2, 4, 7] .\n\nHowever, most existing cognitive tutors rely on predefined question banks or templates that limit the diversity and personalization of the questions they can generate. Moreover, they often fail to foster knowledge transfer across different domains or contexts. These limitations may reduce the effectiveness and engagement of cognitive tutors for some students  [3] .\n\nIn this paper, I propose a novel solution that leverages Davinci-003 API, a powerful natural language processing (NLP) engine developed by OpenAI, to create a cognitive tutor that can generate and evaluate personalized questions for students on any topic they choose. The tutor adapts to the student's level of understanding and fosters knowledge transfer by generating questions that relate the topic to different domains. For example, if the student chooses \"photosynthesis\" as their topic, the tutor may generate questions that connect photosynthesis to biology, chemistry, physics, ecology, or even art  [5, 8] .\n\nWe demonstrate the feasibility of my solution through a working prototype developed using Microsoft PowerApps, a low-code platform that allows users to create custom applications without coding. I also discuss some potential extensions of my solution based on affective computing principles and ASD-specific design guidelines. I compare my solution with existing AI tutors in terms of functionality and scope. Finally, I include an equity statement that outlines my commitment to promoting educational equity and addressing potential biases in my project.\n\nThe rest of this paper is organized as follows: Section 2 describes Davinci-003 API and how it can be used for adaptive question generation and assessment. Section 3 presents my prototype design and implementation details. Section 4 discusses some possible future directions for improving my solution.",

This feature can be used for adaptive question generation and assessment in cognitive tutoring systems. By providing Davinci-003 API with some instructions and a text or context as input, it can generate relevant questions that test the student's comprehension of the input. Moreover, it can also evaluate the student's answers by comparing them with its own generated answers or by using some predefined criteria.\n\nFor example, suppose I want to generate questions about photosynthesis with increasing difficulty.

      "text": "Another feature of Davinci-003 API that can be used for adaptive question generation and assessment is its ability to evaluate the student's response based on the initial question. By sending the student's response back to Davinci-003 through the API along with the initial question, I can get Davinci-003 to generate an evaluation of the student's response. The evaluation can include a score, a feedback, or a hint for improvement.\n\nFor example, suppose I ask Davinci-003 this question:\n\nWhat is photosynthesis?\n\nAnd I send back this student's response:\n\nPhotosynthesis is when plants make food from sunlight.\n\nDavinci-003 may generate this evaluation as output:\n\nScore: 7/10 Feedback: Your answer is partially correct. Photosynthesis is not only done by plants, but also by some bacteria and algae . Also, photosynthesis does not directly make food, but rather chemical energy that can be later used to make food . Hint: Try to include more details and accuracy in your answer. You can use the text or context as a reference.",

      "section_name": "Transfer Generation",
      "text": "One of the goals of cognitive tutoring systems is to foster knowledge transfer, which is the ability to apply what one has learned in one domain to a new domain or situation. Knowledge transfer is essential for mastering a topic and developing higher-order thinking skills. However, most existing cognitive tutors do not generate questions that promote knowledge transfer across different domains or contexts.\n\nDavinci-003 API can overcome this limitation by generating questions that attempt to transfer the student's knowledge to a new domain in order to ensure mastery. By providing Davinci-003 API with some instructions and a text or context as input, I can specify the target domain or context for the question generation. Davinci-003 API can then generate questions that relate the input to the target domain or context using its general knowledge and reasoning abilities.\n\nFor example, suppose I want to generate questions about photosynthesis that transfer the student's knowledge to art. I can provide Davinci-003 API with these instructions:\n\nGenerate two questions about photosynthesis that relate it to art. Each question should have a short answer.\n\nAnd it may generate these questions as output:\n\nQ1: How can photosynthesis be compared to painting? A1: Photosynthesis can be compared to painting in terms of the inputs and outputs involved. In photosynthesis, plants use light energy, carbon dioxide, and water as inputs to produce carbohydrate molecules and oxygen as outputs . In painting, artists use paint, brushes, and canvas as inputs to produce artworks and visual expressions as outputs .\n\nQ2: What are some artistic techniques that mimic photosynthesis? A2: Some artistic techniques that mimic photosynthesis are:\n\nCyanotype, which is a photographic printing process that uses sunlight to create blue images on paper or fabric.\n\nChlorophyll printing, which is a photographic printing process that uses leaves to create green images on paper or fabric.",

Additionally, the system currently lacks the ability to analyze the emotional valence of the user and tailor its responses accordingly.\n\nIn terms of equity, my solution aligns with my commitment to promoting educational equity and addressing potential biases in the project. The use of a natural language processing engine enables the system to generate personalized and adaptive questions for learners from diverse backgrounds and with different learning needs. The equity statement included in this paper underscores my commitment to ensuring that the cognitive tutor is accessible and inclusive for all learners.\n\nFurther research could address these limitations and improve the effectiveness and engagement of the cognitive tutor. For instance, affective computing principles could be integrated into the system to analyze the user's emotional state and adapt its responses accordingly. Additionally, the system could be tuned to meet the specific needs of learners across the autism spectrum by incorporating ASD-specific design guidelines.",
