      "text": "Music emotion recognition is an important task in MIR (Music Information Retrieval) research. Owing to factors like the subjective nature of the task and the variation of emotional cues between musical genres, there are still significant challenges in developing reliable and generalizable models. One important step towards better models would be to understand what a model is actually learning from the data and how the prediction for a particular input is made. In previous work, we have shown how to derive explanations of model predictions in terms of spectrogram image segments that connect to the high-level emotion prediction via a layer of easily interpretable perceptual features. However, that scheme lacks intuitive musical comprehensibility at the spectrogram level. In the present work, we bridge this gap by merging audioLIMEa source-separation based explainer -with mid-level perceptual features, thus forming an intuitive connection chain between the input audio and the output emotion predictions. We demonstrate the usefulness of this method by applying it to debug a biased emotion prediction model.",

      "text": "The quest for interpreting the inner workings of \"blackbox\" models and explaining their predictions has led to many recent advances in the area of explainable AI and is becoming an increasingly important staple of all AI subfields. Not only do model explanations help in enhancing trust in the model in applications where its predictions are critical decisions like creditworthiness or medical diagnosis, but they can also often reveal telling signs of algorithmic bias  [1, 2] . While algorithmic decisions in the field of MIR are not as life-critical as medical diagnosis, in today's era of music streaming and recommendations, they can have far-reaching effects on diverse audiences, creators, and artists alike. For instance, machine-learningbased music recommender systems have been shown to exhibit severe biases towards or against certain user groups  [3] . Interpretable explanations of these models or their predictions would be extremely helpful for identifying such biases.\n\nPrevious work on interpretability in MIR has dealt with tasks such as music tagging using self-attention  [4]  and transcription using invertible neural networks  [5] , and post-hoc explanations for music content analysis have been used to understand what a genre classifier  [6]  or a singing voice detector  [7] [8] [9] [10] [11]  have learnt. More recently, audioLIME has been proposed  [12, 13]  and has shown promise in explaining tagging models  [14]  as well as recommendation models  [15] .\n\nHowever, explanations of music emotion recognition systems have received relatively less attention notwithstanding the importance of this task in the areas of musical analysis and recommendation.  [16]  used models trained with different combinations of sound sources to deduce the importance of each source to emotion predictions. We previously proposed using an intermediate layer of mid-level perceptual features  [17]  to explain music emotion recognition models through a linear connection between the intermediate and final layers  [18] . We followed this up with a two-step explanation approach  [19]  to further explain the predictions in the mid-level layer using components from the input spectrogram. This two-level scheme used LIME (Local Interpretable Model-agnostic Explanations)  [13]  to construct explanations for the mid-level predictions in terms of specific patches of the input spectrogram (which were obtained via image segmentation). While this gave us the regions in the spectrogram contributing most to a particular prediction, these regions did not hold any musical meaning by themselves. As a result, it is difficult to comprehend these explanations in terms of meaningful or intuitive concepts.\n\nIn this work, we bridge this gap by merging the audioLIME method, which uses sound sources as explanatory features, with the approach of mid-level features, to obtain comprehensible explanations from the input audio as well as from the perceptual layer. It thus forms an intuitive connection of hierarchical explanations from lowlevel constituent sources of audio to the high-level emotion predictions through the intermediary mid-level layer, all of which have a musical interpretation. We believe that explainability is particularly important for developing better music emotion recognition algorithms since it is often difficult to identify misclassifications and biases in this task because of its inherent subjectivity and inter-annotator variability. As an example of real-life application of our method in understanding the potential cause of bias in an emotion model, we demonstrate how a model that has seen few examples of a genre during training results in a pattern of errors on the test set that contains examples of this genre. We trace this pattern of errors back to a particular mid-level feature and this feature to a particular source in the input. Doing so allows us to predict how the model would change when retrained with a balanced training set. We can then qualitatively verify that the retrained model has in fact changed in the way that we expected from our explanations.",

      "text": "In order to explain individual mid-level predictions we make use of audioLIME, a recently introduced approach based on LIME  [13]  for interpreting models in MIR  [12, 14] . LIME uses simplified inputs based on a set of human interpretable features (depending on the domain of the task -e.g., superpixels for images) to train a simpler explanation model 𝑔 in order to explain a more complex, potentially deep model 𝑓 . Previous approaches based on LIME have used time-, frequency-, or time-frequency segments  [7] , or segments computed by an image segmentation algorithm  [19] . audioLIME introduced a new type of interpretable features: sound sources estimated by a music source separation algorithm. In other words, the audioLIME explanation for a given prediction will be in the form of particular sound sources (and possibly specific temporal segments -which we do not use right now), telling us that it is some sonic aspects of these sources that seem to be influential. In our case, the source separator is the pretrained music source separator spleeter  [20] , thus the explanatory sound sources will be (what the source separator believes are) individual instruments.",

      "text": "Mid-level features are perceptual qualities or descriptors that emerge from low-level musical building blocks such as timbre, beat structure, harmony, etc. They are more subjective than the low-level features, thus difficult to model using hand-crafted feature extractors, but musically discernible enough to have many people reach a high agreement in annotations. Examples include qualities such as perceived melodiousness or rhythmic complexity  [17] . They, therefore, form a suitable choice for an intermediary to higher-level concepts like emotion.\n\nThis idea was first used in  [18]  to explain emotion predictions. We use a similar approach here, but we use the more recently introduced receptive-field regularized ResNets  [21, 22]  to model the emotions and the mid-level features. In addition, we learn the emotions and mid-level features from two separate datasets using multi-task learning, i.e., jointly learn to predict mid-level features and high-level emotions, allowing us to be flexible with our train and test domains.\n\nThe mid-level layer is the penultimate layer of the model, with a linear transformation between it and the final (emotion) layer, thus making the connection interpretable. It is learnt end-to-end from audio spectrograms by optimizing on the combined loss from the emotion and mid-level layers.\n\nEmotion predictions can be interpreted by looking at effects plots, which are visual representations of the contribution of each mid-level feature to the final emotion prediction, calculated as the product of the feature value and the weight joining it to the emotion. These indicate the relative influence of the individual features on the final prediction.",

Given these two explanations, we can describe a prediction as being arrived at by the model due to the explanatory mid-level feature, which is in turn most influenced by the input component given by audioLIME.",

      "text": "Evaluating the quality of explanations is a hard task since there is no consensus on what makes a good explanation, with a variety of desired aims and properties proposed in literature  [26] [27] [28] ). We build our evaluation of audioLIME explanations for the mid-level layer on two metrics, (a) fidelity as proposed by Ribeiro et al. along with LIME  [13]  and, (b) complexity, a recently proposed metric for featurebased model explanations  [26] .\n\nFidelity measures how well the local model 𝑔 (the explainer) approximates the global model 𝑓 (the model up to the mid-level layer in our case)  [13]  and is computed using the coefficient of determination between the local and global model's predictions as in the original LIME implementation  1  .\n\nIn addition to high fidelity, low complexity is desired. The most complex explanation would be the one where all 𝑑 features get the same attribution (i.e., all weights 𝑔(𝑓, 𝑥) 𝑖 of the linear explanation model 𝑔 are the same). The simplest explanation concentrates all attribution on one feature. To measure complexity, a probability distribution 𝑃 𝑔 is defined:\n\nComplexity is then defined as the entropy of this distribution  [26] . We compare the complexity per dataset with a random baseline, which is obtained by creating \"random\" explanations with feature weights drawn from a uniform distribution.\n\nFor the analysis, we compute predictions and explanations for all test examples and calculate the above mentioned metrics. The results for one mid-level feature (we picked \"rhythmic stability\" as it is used later on as an example) are summarized in Figures  1  and 2 . We can see in Figure  1a  that the fidelity score (coefficient of determination) is relatively high across all combinations of models and test sets. The median score is 0.86 across all explanations (including all mid-level features), the 25%-quantile is at 0.78. This means that for 50% and 75% of the explanations more than 86%, and 78%, respectively, of the variation in the dependent variable (mid-level prediction) can be predicted using the independent variables (instrument sources).\n\nFigure  1b  shows the computed complexities, compared to a random baseline. Most explanations are far less complex than the random baseline.\n\nThe results shown in the previous figures suggested a relationship between the fidelity and complexity scores.   Therefore we visualized the two metrics for all explanations computed for \"rhythmic stability\" for a model trained on the combined data sets in Figure  2 . Although they seem related on a dataset level, the metrics do not look related when analyzed for each explanation separately, suggesting that indeed both are needed.",

In Figure  5 , we can see that PMEmo has a large percentage of hiphop songs whereas both DEAM and Mid-level datasets have a small percentage. Since our model has not seen enough hiphop songs during training, it is to be expected that it does not perform well when it encounters hiphop during test.

In our case, the target is valence and there are seven mid-level features that affect it. We are only interested in relative contribution of each feature, and so we divide each effect by the sum of the absolute values of the effects of all features and take the average across all test songs tagged \"hiphop\".

      "text": "Bringing together our two types of explanations, we can reason that the high valence predictions for hiphop songs is due to overestimation of rhythmic stability, which, in this case, can be attributed to the vocals. While there is a lot of diversity in the style of rapping (the form of vocal delivery predominant in hiphop), it has been noted that rappers typically use stressed syllables and vocal onsets to match the vocals with the underlying rhythmic pulse  [30, 31] . These rhythmic characteristics of vocal delivery (that constitutes \"flow\", and may add metrical layers on top of the beat) contribute strongly to the rhythmic feel of a song. The positive or negative emotion of hiphop songs is mostly contained in the lyrics -the style of vocal performance does not necessarily express or correlate with this aspect of emotion. Therefore, it makes sense that a model which has seen few examples of hiphop during training should wrongly associate the prominent rhythmic vocals of hiphop to high rhythmic stability and in turn high valence. A model that has been trained with hiphop songs included, we expect, would place less importance on rhythmic stability for the prediction of valence, even if the vocals might still contribute significantly to rhythmic stability. Thus, we expect the relative effect of rhythmic stability for valence to decrease in such a model. This is exactly what we observe on a model trained with the combined PMEmo+DEAM dataset. The average relative effects are shown in Figure  4b  and we can see that the relative effect of rhythmic stability has decreased while those of minorness, melody, and tonal stability have increased. Thus, the model changed in a way that was in line with what we expected from the analysis of our two-level explanation method.\n\nLooking at mean overestimations (Figure  6 ) in valence for hiphop and other genres for models trained on DEAM and PMEmo+DEAM shows that valence overestimations of hiphop songs have decreased substantially, without negatively affecting the predictions on other genres 3  .",

An immediate next step that we are currently pursuing is to extend audioLIME to provide explanations in the form of temporal segments using semantic music segmentation, along with the sound sources.
