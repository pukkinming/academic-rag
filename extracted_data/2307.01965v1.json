      "text": "Phone scams remain a difficult problem to tackle due to the combination of protocol limitations, legal enforcement challenges and advances in technology enabling attackers to hide their identities and reduce costs. Scammers use social engineering techniques to manipulate victims into revealing their personal details, purchasing online vouchers or transferring funds, causing significant financial losses. This paper aims to establish a methodology with which to semi-automatically analyze scam calls and infer information about scammers, their scams and their strategies at scale. Obtaining data for the study of scam calls is challenging, as true scam victims do not in general record their conversations. Instead, we draw from the community of \"scam baiters\" on YouTube: individuals who interact knowingly with phone scammers and publicly publish their conversations. These can not be considered as true scam calls, however they do provide a valuable opportunity to study scammer scripts and techniques, as the scammers are unaware that they are not speaking to a true scam victim for the bulk of the call. We applied topic and time series modeling alongside emotion recognition to scammer utterances and found clear evidence of scripted scam progressions that matched our expectations from close reading. We identified social engineering techniques associated with identified script stages including the apparent use of emotion as a social engineering tool. Our analyses provide new insights into strategies used by scammers and presents an effective methodology to infer such at scale. This work serves as a first step in building a better understanding of phone scam techniques, forming the ground work for more effective detection and prevention mechanisms that draw on a deeper understanding of the phone scam phenomenon.",

      "text": "Phone scams, sometimes referred to as voice phishing or 'vishing', are a form of social engineering attack that leverages the telephone system. Scammers generate persuasive scenarios to convince victims to share personal information or pay at times substantial sums of money. These can e.g., impersonate authoratitive sources such as tax or law enforcement, offer seemingly free gifts or present a imagined threat such as a hacker accessing your bank details. The prevalence of phone scams has increased dramatically in recent years  [17] ,  [50]  flagging an urgent need for effective methods to combat them. Reports show that people suffer significant loses due to scams, losing, for example, $1.2 billion to impostor scams in the US in 2020 alone  [10] . Victims of successful scams often feel embarrassment, guilt and shame, which is believed to contribute to the under-reporting of fraud cases  [8] , with some demographics appearing disproportionately affected [9],  [15] ,  [19] ,  [21] ,  [25] .\n\nThe problem of phone scams remains difficult to solve due to existing telecommunication system limitations (e.g. the existence of legacy phone networks in the global phone system that do not support modern security measures) and techniques and technology used by bad actors (e.g. VoIP and Caller ID spoofing)  [11] ,  [44] . Scammers also frequently operate outside of the victim's jurisdiction making it difficult to address from a legal and law enforcement perspective.\n\nConsidering scammers' monetary gains and difficulties with securing the telephone network, scam calls will likely remain a popular choice for criminals. Maintaining up-to-date data about the ongoing scam campaigns, scammer behavior and the techniques they employ is challenging and yet crucial to design and maintain effective defensive approaches. Data acquisition needs to be at once agile, able to adapt to the ever-changing scam landscape, to provide deep insights into the techniques employed in current scams and to do all this at scale. One particular application of such insights, and the initial motivation of this study, is the creation of conversational AI bots that masquerade as susceptible scam victims. Recent advances in conversational AI allow for fluent generation of language, however they still struggle with situational awareness, hence incorporation of live contextual knowledge in to such models promises to improve their ability to act as convincing scam victims. In this study we introduce a semi-automated framework to analyze scam calls and infer information about scammers, their scam approaches and strategies at scale. We demonstrate our framework on a sample of recordings obtained from public sources, identifying insightful details on how scammers operate.\n\nTo obtain scam transcripts, we searched YouTube for videos mentioning \"scam call\" or \"scam call recording\" as well as trawling the 'scambaiting' YouTube tag. We transcribed the audio of the resulting videos using a commercial automated transcription service and further cleaned the data to remove irrelevant transcripts and sections of the transcripts that are not part of the scam call, leaving us with 341 transcripts totaling 90 hours of scam calls to analyze. Approximately 60% of the 825 originally collected videos either did not contain actual conversations with scammers or were deemed of insufficient quality (e.g.: containing only short disconnected snippets of scam conversation). Though this data does not constitute true conversations between scammers and their victims and represents a small sample of primarily US scam types, it does allow us to analyze scammer methodologies, including the scripts they follow and particular social engineering techniques they apply. Scam baiters deliberately draw out the call and present challenging personas to the scammers, providing a rich view on how the scammers themselves behave in a diversity of situations. Further, the actions of scam baiters and responses of scammers are a perfect match for the purpose of training and informing AI \"victim bots\", our initial and primary motivator. It must be pointed out that scam baiters are not true victims, and though they may attempt to pose as such, likely do not present many behaviors that a true victim may exhibit. Thus our study can provide insights into the scripts and techniques used by scammers and some scammer behaviors, but cannot be considered comprehensive.\n\nThe framework begins with the identification of phone scam types present in available data. We manually label all transcripts, identifying four main scam types and 3 further scam types with a marginal presence. Identifying the type of scam being undertaken in a call can be useful for gaining a deeper understanding of the mechanisms and techniques used by scammers. We then demonstrate recognition of the type of scam given a relatively small sample of annotated scams and simulated scam type recognition in a live call setting by limiting the number of utterances available to the recognition model. We found that identification of the scam type of a call is effective with just one utterance (80-90% accuracy) and highly accurate with 5 or 6 utterances (92-98%).\n\nNext, we propose an analysis of the content of each type of scam. We apply a contextualized topic model  [14]  and a publicly available emotion detection model to scammer utterances. We find that the topic model is able to identify scam themes observed during close reading of scam transcripts and note relatively subdued emotions on the part of the scammer.\n\nDuring close reading of the transcripts, we observed consistent sequences of scam stages, with the scammers appearing to follow pre-defined scripts. In order to verify this observation, and as a further tool to automate the analysis and understanding of scammer techniques and the mechanisms they leverage, we apply a Hidden Markov Model (HMM) to the outputs of the topic model. HMMs attempt to uncover simple state transition processes underlying complex sequences of observations. We found that the HMM models are able to capture the structure and flow of the scam calls, again with clear interpretations that match close reading. This is an indication that the scammers use a consistent scam structure, likely following a well defined script. We verified the model through manual annotation and found model outputs to match human interpretations of identified scam stages. We then construct a machine learning model to infer the state in a live call setting (i.e., from the utterances up to a given point in a transcript, infer the scam state at that point). We were able to correctly infer the states with reasonable accuracy, achieving an increase of 45% accuracy over a random model for scam types with more than 50 available transcripts, and around 80% accuracy when we accept predictions that are one step ahead or behind. An overview of our processing and analysis pipeline can be found in Figure  1 .\n\nThe story thus revealed is scripted scam progressions with embedded social engineering techniques. For example, in social security number scams, the scammer first establishes themselves in a position of authority, posing as a representative of the social security administration or similar authority, then describes an ongoing investigation into highly illegal events (drug smuggling, money laundering, allusions to murder, ...) associated with the victim's social security number, all the while stating that their aim is to prove the victim innocent. The victim is asked to pay a fee to expedite the resolution process and avoid being prosecuted.\n\nTo the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to apply automated machine learning techniques to scam call recordings and effectively extract meaningful insights into scripts used by scammers and their strategies and behaviors. Our analysis allows us to paint a rich picture of the characteristics of scam calls, leading to a deeper understanding of the phenomenon. This work is intended as a first step toward future mitigation strategies and tools such as real time early detection and public education, leading to protection of potential victims and reduction of the amount of money lost to scams.\n\nThe key contributions of this paper are as follows:\n\n1) We collect and collate a data set of 341 conversations between scam baiters and scammers, annotated by scam type. We publicly released this data set at http:to.be.rele ased.on.acceptance. 2) We develop and demonstrate a semi-automated framework for identifying and tracking current phone scam scripts, scammer behavior and scam strategies at scale. Our framework leverages hidden Markov models combined with topic modeling and automated emotion recognition for identifying the progression of scam scripts and facilitating the recognition of persuasion techniques used in telephony scams. We demonstrate effective predictive models in a simulated live call setting. We publicly release the code for our predictive models at http:to.be.released .on.acceptance. 3) We provide a summary of insights into the rich tapestry of social engineering techniques identified in our data through a combination of our automated analyses and close reading of the scam conversations.",

      "text": "a) Current solutions:: Solutions to the problem of phone scams have been suggested for both telecommunications provider  [48] ,  [54]  and end user applications  [34] ,  [40] ,  [41]  to combat Caller ID spoofing through authentication. However, as of the writing of this paper, these have not seen widespread adoption in part because, to be effective, they would need to adopted universally across the globe.\n\nExisting deployed solutions focus primarily on creating blocklists of known bad numbers  [36]  or proposing a reputation system based on caller behavior  [12] ,  [26] ,  [29]  yet many scam calls make it through despite these measures  [53] . It has been shown, for example, that adding a number to the national Do-Not-Call Register may produce the opposite result  [45]  with attackers potentially abusing such lists. Researchers have also proposed analyzing the audio features of the call  [13] , developing virtual assistants that vett incoming calls  [35] , implementing application indicators that alert users to potentially unsafe calls  [49]  and using simple natural language processing techniques on initial call utterances to detect scams  [20] . Several commercial scam detection tools have recently appeared using these and related data driven techniques  [2] -  [5] ,  [7] .\n\nDespite these scam call prevention technology advancements, 2022 industry and government reports  [1] ,  [6] ,  [18]  show that the scam calls as well as related monetary losses continue to increase (e.g., in 2022, over 30% more money was lost than in 2021 as a result of the phone scams in Australia). b) Datasets and telephony honeypots:: The 'in the moment' nature of telephone conversations makes it difficult to analyze them on a large scale. As a result, data used in research of scam calls to date has been limited in scale (e.g.  [20] ,  [47] ) or containing primarily call metadata with no or little call content (e.g.,  [26] ,  [29] ,  [38] ).\n\nTelephony honeypots, systems deployed in telephony networks to capture malicious calls, are one option to scale up the study of malicious calls. Drawing on the use of honeypots to detect network intrusions, telephony honeypots have been deployed to detect voice spam  [24] ,  [32] ,  [38] ,  [39] . Similar methods were used to discover, record and analyze tech support scams  [33] . Despite some success of these methods, legal and regulatory constraints associated with recording calls in various jurisdictions as well as the need to engage with scammers in real time present challenges to this approach. c) Telemarketing and chatbots:: There are some similarities between telemarketing and scam calls in respect to technology and delivery methods used, however attackers' motivations, approaches and impact on victims differ when it comes to phone scams  [44] . Attempts have been made to waste telemarketers' and scammers' time using pre-recorded messages and chatbots  [42] ,  [46]  however this approach has not been widely applied to countering scam calls. d) Conversation analysis:: Some preliminary analysis of phone scams has been performed  [31] ,  [42]  highlighting the challenges with data collection compared to traditional phishing attempts. Researchers have studied persuasion techniques  [27]  finding a similar diversity in persuasive techniques to our analysis with the exception that they identified social proof as common where we did not find evidence of that technique. A further study used forensic linguistics  [52]  to analyze scam calls so as to better understand methods used by attackers. More recently, the use of 'scam signatures' has been proposed  [20] , paving the way for early detection of scams based on semantic content of the conversation. Natural language processing techniques have been suggested to improve detection of phishing and other social engineering attempts in emails  [28] ,  [37] , and phone scams  [47] . Approaches to date, however, are not scalable, requiring substantial human input and tested on very small data sets.",

Scam baiters are individuals who engage with and record scam calls, attempting to draw out the call then typically confront the scammers about their unethical practices. While these calls cannot be considered representative of genuine interactions between scammers and their intended victims, the scammer utterances however are bona fide and provide insights into scammer techniques as well as the progression of hypothesised scam call scripts.\n\nWe searched YouTube for channels that mention \"scam baiting\" (or \"scam baiters\", \"scammers baited\", etc.) and manually vetted all their uploaded videos, carefully selecting those that predominately contained actual scam calls and with long, coherent scammer conversations. We filtered out instances of videos where scam baiters used irony or offensive language towards the scammers, and only kept the videos where the scam baiters seriously acted out the role of a scam victim.\n\nIn this way, we obtained 341 transcripts primarily from six different scam baiting channels with an average length of 90.7 utterances (44.8 for scammers, 45.9 for scam baiters) and a median length of 82 (40.5 for scammers, 41 for scam baiters), and a maximum length 242 utterances.

Interestingly, the most common scam types (reward, support, refund and social security number) were present in the recordings of all scam baiters. However, we can observe that scam baiters have a preference for a certain types of scam calls (e.g., Boda Scambaits published a significant number of scams about social security numbers).\n\nTable I presents a detailed overview of the transcripts collected for each scam baiter. Looking at the utterances lengths in words and seconds, we observed that 3 scam baiters (Scammer Jammer, Rinoa Poison and IRLrosie) try to overtalk the scammer, whereas the remaining 3 scam baiters allow the scammer to dominate the conversation.",

Some transcripts were completely removed as, on closer inspection, they did not resemble a realistic scam call and instead were likely produced entirely for entertainment purposes.\n\nDue to the artificial nature of the \"victim\" in these calls, our analysis focuses on scammer utterances.

Scammers attempt to prevent interruption of the script or defer questions by talking over the victim. The victim is nudged towards a faster and easier option to avoid negative consequences by 'resolving the matter' here and now, introducing time pressure and preventing the victim from taking the time to think this through. The \"quick resolution\" is claimed to be available only if acted on immediately, introducing further time pressure. A decision is demanded during the call; a refund, reward or reversal is promised if the victim complies.\n\nDepending on the scam type, an attempt to establish the victim's location or request to travel to a location where the fee can be paid, gift card purchased or money deposited is often carried out. This is followed by a payment or purchase request or obtaining the victim's bank card details. Specific, not rounded up amounts are requested and legitimate sounding ways to pay are mentioned.\n\nAlternatively, rapport building and polite social protocol is followed in other scam types (e.g. tech support). Legitimate sounding explanations of the reason for the request and specific details are shared to add credibility to claims. Step-by-step guidance to navigate to a website, install software (often TeamViewer to get remote access to the victim's machine) or fill out online forms with personal and often financial information is provided.\n\nA handover to another individual, often a supervisor, is sometimes introduced by scammers when a given milestone in the script is achieved (e.g. victim installs TeamViewer or confirms banking details).\n\nDue to the length of some calls or if the desired result is not achieved immediately, scammers may attempt to end the current call and continue the scam in a subsequent call at a later stage.",

We found 7 types of scam in the transcripts (see Section V-A), however, three of them, \"family member\", \"tax\" and \"charity\", have marginal presence, with only 2, 2 and 1 transcripts respectively and are not considered for further analysis. Social security number scam transcripts are the largest group in our dataset (140), followed by refund scams (110). The remaining transcripts belong to support (63) and reward  (25)  scams. Statistics on our data set can be found in Table  II .\n\nFirstly, we measured basic text statistics to learn what is the conversation approach of the parties (Scammer and Scam Baiter). Surprisingly, scammers do not always dominate the conversation. In terms of word count and duration, scammers used more words in social security number and refund scams, whereas Scam Baiters are more talkative in support and reward scam types. We can posit the presence of extended explanations on the part of scammers in these scams as the cause, however we acknowledge that active distraction from the Scammer's directions and story by Scam Baiters will also be a significant factor.\n\nRegarding word rate both Scammer and Scam Baiter are close to the regular speech rate range (2 -2.5 wps 1  ). There appears to be a level of word rate coordination: higher scam baiter word rates matched with higher scammer word rates. This is of interest, as it indicates a level of connection, where the scam baiter may be affecting the scammer, and warrants further investigation.",

The model estimates Ekman's 6 basic emotions plus neutral: joy, sadness, anger, fear, disgust, surprise and neutral. The model was trained using cross-entropy loss on discrete labels (0 if an emotion is not present, 1 if it is). As such the scores can be interpreted as probabilities that the given emotion is present.\n\nFigure  3  presents distributions of emotion scores by scam type. We found that for all scam types, surprise and anger are the most common emotion. We note that overall, the scammers were less emotional than the scam baiters. This is particularly visible with surprise. We propose two complementary explanations for this. First, the primary scam types present in our data present serious scenarios: identity theft (social security number scams), ongoing hacking of the victim's computer (support scams), and scammers posing as company representatives (refund and reward scams). In those roles, it is natural that the scammer would be serious and unemotional, but this also plays a role in social engineering, increasing the sense of authority. Second, on listening to the calls, it was our impression that that the Scam Baiters were acting out exaggerated roles, in part to entertain their audience and in part to engage the scammers. It is unclear how their portrayals would relate to the emotions of true scam victims and potential victims.",

      "section_name": "1) Topic Modelling:",
      "text": "We used contextualised topic models  [14] , a recent neural topic model combining contextualised representations from large pre-trained language models and the variational auto-encoding neural topic model ProdLDA  [51] . We trained a model with 50 topics on scammer utterances. The model showed good topic diversity (inverse rank biased overlap  [14]  0.993) and reasonable coherence (C V coherence  [43]  of 0.454). We explored β values of 0.01, 0.1, 1.0 and 3, and found 1.0 to perform well on both C V and N P M I coherence metrics.\n\nWe manually labelled each topic by considering both the top topic words and observing the top utterances (those scoring highest on the topic) and a weighted sample of utterances (using topic scores as weights) from the top 100 utterances. In most cases, consistent and readily interpretable semantics were observed, with a small number of topics appearing to merge distinct meanings (6 topics) and a small number with no apparent coherent meaning (2 topics). Table  III  lists the most prominent topics for each scam type. See Appendix C for a full list of estimated topic labels and indications of merged/incoherent topics. Overall, we found that the topic model successfully revealed semantics that we observed in the data.\n\nFinally, we discuss topics and their frequency of appearance in utterances of each scam type. The top topics (with probability above 1.5x the average topic probability of 0.02) and their frequencies are shown in Table  III . The complete topic frequency data can be found in Appendix C. For the social security scams, we found 6 topics with elevated probability. For example, topics 32 and 39 that address legal charges against the victim. Similarly, we found elevated probability for topics that describe vouchers and gift cards with reward scams (topics 6 and 38). In the case of support scams, the 2 topics with elevated probability  (8 and 22)  focus on technical details such as computer or phone instructions. Interestingly, refund scams do not have topics with elevated representation above our chosen threshold, and we show the top two topics. We note that the highest topic frequencies for support and refund scams are relatively low. We believe this is due to the lower quantity of data from these scam types and the observed diversity in the scripts and techniques used.\n\n2) Hidden Markov Models over Topics: We use a hidden Markov model to extract scam scripts presumed to be followed by the scammers for each scam type. Hidden Markov models seek to represent time sequence data as the trace of a finite state machine. States \"generate\" utterances through a list of topic probabilities (known as emission probabilities) associated with each state and there is a table of state transition probabilities which determine the state of the subsequent utterance. HMM inference algorithms attempt to find a set of states (given by emission probabilities) and a state transition table which maximises the probability that the data was generated by those states and transitions. Typically the number of states is fixed.\n\nWe use the multinomial hidden Markov model from the python package hmmlearn with default parameters. The data consisted of the top topic (from our 50 topic model) for each utterance, providing a sequence of integers (one for each utterance) for each transcript.\n\nFirst, we split the data into 3 equal subsets (train, validation and test) and and made an initial selection of the number of states for each scam type through grid search, ranking by log likelihood on validation data. We observed that the log likelihood scores on test data with the resulting models aligned with those on validation data and were marginally better than on training data, indicating that the model is not overfitting. We then used 5-way cross validation on all data to make a final choice of the best number of states for each scam type  4  , then trained our final models using all available data. In all cases, we fit each model configuration 50 times, taking the model with best log likelihood (on validation data for cross validation and on all data for the final models). This is usual practice with this kind of HMM model, as the gradient descent based EM (Expectation -Maximization) algorithm has a tendency to get stuck in local minima -multiple random starts usually results in a much better fit.\n\nTo evaluate the models, we first examined the apparent meaning and coherence of inferred states. We manually labeled each inferred state by considering the labels and utterances associated with the most significant topics linked to each state. Overall, we found that a consistent interpretation could be applied to the utterances associated to a given state and that the progression of states is readily interpretable as a scam script progression and agrees with our observations from close reading. An example social security number transcript with utterance states is provided in Appendix F. Figure  4  shows the resulting graph for refund scams, see Appendix D for the remainder.\n\nWe then chose one transcript from each scam type at random and three authors manually annotated utterances using our state labels and descriptions of associated topics as a guide. We allowed two state choices where there was some ambiguity and considered annotations to agree if the second choice matched the first choice of other annotators. Table  IV  shows Krippendorff's Alpha between annotators and Cohen's Kappa between states inferred by HMM models and those obtained by vote between annotators, alongside the number of utterances in the selected transcripts and number of states used in both annotation and HMM models. We found that annotators could consistently identify states, with strong inter-annotator agreement for Refund and Reward and moderate agreement for social security number and support scams. Kappa scores show substantial agreement with HMM inferred states for all but the Reward scam, which has moderate agreement. Scam types with more data provided HMM models with more states that were also more expressive and easier to interpret. This reflects the ability of statistical based dimensionality reduction models such as HMMs and topic models to reliably extract structures in the data. With more data, there is sufficient evidence for more nuanced models without overfitting. Another feature of the graphs to note is the generally lower probabilities assigned to transitions in the later stages. This is particularly prominent with states 3 and 4 with social security number scams (see Appendix E), which appeared mostly at the end of transcripts and whose links did not pass the threshold for inclusion in the graphs. We believe this is due to two factors: first, the fact that a significant proportion of the transcripts end before the later stages of the presumed scam script, hence there is relatively little data, resulting in less focused states (covering broader semantics) with fewer transitions. The second factor is the greater diversity in conversations in later stages of the scam, where the scammer adapts their instructions to the victims circumstances and the scam baiter has had more opportunity to derail the script. We observed numerous transcripts where the conversation diverged into random and extended chit-chat -essentially, the scam baiter had succeeded in distracting the scammer from the script.\n\nAnother important methodological point is the value of building these HMM models on data from a single type of scam, which substantially improves the clarity of the resulting model. We at first built a model on all our data, and although it was not without interesting and interpretable structures, the models we present here are much more focused and more clearly interpretable. This highlights the importance of classifying and labeling scam types. We note that topic models are more robust to diverse semantics (indeed are designed to tease them out), and being unsupervised, generally require more data to obtain a good model, thus we chose to pool data across scam types for the topic model.\n\nThe coherence of the structures in the underlying data also plays a role here, and we take the success of the HMM approach, together with the sequential nature of the resulting models as indicators that there are well defined sequential structures consistent across the data, supporting the hypothesis that the scammers are following pre-defined scam scripts. We further discuss interpretation of the inferred HMM models from the perspective of social engineering in Section VI.",

      "text": "The term \"social engineering\" covers persuasive techniques used by scammers to convince their victims to act to their own detriment and to the scammers benefit. In this section we discuss social engineering techniques observed through close reading of our data and topics and HMM states associated with those techniques.\n\nThe art of persuasion has been studied over many years, and several categorisations of psychological principles that can enable a manipulator to control the actions and choices of victims have emerged. In the words of pioneering psychologist in this area, B. J. Fogg \"As I see it, social influence is a broad area, with flexible boundaries and competing ways to categorise influence strategies\"  [23] . Keeping that in mind and for the purposes of simplicity, we organise our discussion of social engineering techniques following the five categories provided by Ferreira et.al.  [22] , which draws together two previous categorisations  [16] ,  [55]  into a single model and has a focus on techniques used in phishing, taking careful note of boundary cases and those that do not really fit.\n\nWe investigated the data through a combination of close reading and interpretation of topic model topics and HMM states seeking to identify the application of social engineering by the scammers. Overall, we found that the scam calls are very rich in applied social engineering techniques, with a substantial proportion of scammer utterances building on the persuasive landscape of the scams. It is not the purpose of this work to provide a comprehensive review of the techniques used in our data, however we provide here examples of the more prominent uses of persuasive techniques we encountered, and where practical, link them to topics and HMM states.\n\nWe also note that in many cases, multiple persuasive techniques are combined in a single scam step or even in a single utterance. This is not unusual in persuasive acts, for example the invitation messages of successful Facebook apps often achieve this  [23] . One example is this quote from a social security number scam: . . . be specific and genuine on this phone call because this recording can be used in your favor or can be used against you in the courthouse. . . . Here we see Authority (referring to the court house), distraction (fear of legal consequences) and commitment (once the victim provides the requested PII).\n\nAuthority (AUTH): Society trains people not to question authority so they are conditioned to respond to it. People usually follow an expert or pretence of authority and do a great deal for someone they think is an authority.  [22]  This is a common persuasive technique used in scams as has previously been observed (e.g.  [27] ), and our data is no exception. We observed the scammers assuming the role of an officer from the social security administration in social security scams (. . . you for calling social security administration. . . , . . . My name is officer Carol Snyder. . . ), or a qualified IT support professional in support scams, of an employee from a reputable company in reward scams (. . . Thank you for calling PayPal. This is Daniel. How can I help you?. . . ).\n\nFurther subtle markers of authority are also present in several scam types. Examples include the scammer \"verifying the identity\" of the victim (e.g. state 7 and topic 46, . . . Can you verify me the last four digits of social security number?. . . ) as well as formal sounding language and procedures (. . . This is the case identification number. . . ).",

In this way, they will not be held solely responsible for their actions.  [22]  In the scam types present in our data, this technique did not appear to play a significant role.\n\nLiking, Similarity & Deception (LSD): People prefer to abide to whom (they think) they know or like, or to whom they are similar to or familiar with, as well as attracted to.  [22]  In all scam types, we find HMM states that resemble informal chit-chat. The willingness of scammers to engage in friendly conversation with their victims appears to be an application of this technique. This is suggested in particular by the common proximity of chit-chat with payment instructions and procedures, a critical point in a scam at which the trust of victim is crucial.\n\nIn some transcripts, the scammer and scam baiter already know each other from previous calls, meaning the scam spans several days and multiple calls. This longer engagement engenders familiarity and trust and represents the application of this technique.",

      "text": "People feel more confident in their decision once they commit (publicly) to a specific action and need to follow it through until the end. This is true whether in the workplace, or in a situation when their action is illegal. People have tendency to believe what others say and need, and they want to appear consistent in what they do, for instance, when they owe a favour. There is an automatic response of repaying a favour.  [22]  This category is rather broad, and covers multiple categories from other categorisation schemes.\n\nReciprocation: Scammers will often state that they are attempting to help the victim (. . . So let me help you to get connected with our Amazon. . . -refund scam; . . . I just wanting to help you out to get there.. . . -support scam; . . . There is no need to worry because I'm here to help you. . . -social security number), which represents an appeal to Reciprocity.\n\nCommitment: In all the main scam types in our data, after explaining the situation, the scammer asks if the victim would like to fix the problem (social security number, support and refund) or receive the gift (reward). By answering \"yes\", the victim is subsequently motivated to proceed with the scam rather than go back on their commitment.\n\nAn involved sequence of tasks for the victim is also a form of commitment, where the victim has invested in and implicitly validated the scenario presented by the scammer. In social security number scams, the victim is asked to verify their identity (state 7), write down the case id (state 10), listen to the litany of evidence against them (states 1, 0). In refund scams, victims are asked to provide information about their phone/computer (state 3) and download and install remote desktop software (state 5).\n\nOne question of note that appears in many social security scams asks the victim for approximate bank balances (. . . what will be the current dollar amount balance approximately you having in your checking account and as well as in your savings?. . . ). We believe this also serves to inform the scammer of the value of the victim -particularly high value victims are afforded more time and effort, and are often redirected to more senior scammers.",

[22]  All scam types in our data utilise a form of distractiona (typically highly emotional, typically fearful) scenario that captures the victims attention such that they focus less on the steps they are asked to take.\n\nIn support scams, the scammer reports that there has been suspicious activity on the victim's computer and goes on to claim that it has been hacked and the hackers can steal their bank details etc. . . In refund scams, they claim that a victim's online purchasing account has had an expensive order that was suspicious (. . .

      "text": "The exception is the HHM model for reward scams which was not as successful at identifying scam structure, likely due to lack of data (see Section V-C2). For example, in refund scams (Figure  4 ) greeting is represented by state 0., problem explanation is covered by state 4. States 3., 1., and 5. describe instructions on what to do and states 6., 8., and 7. target financial exploitation. Note that the greetings for each scam type are distinct, with the scammers introducing themselves as different characters, using different levels of formality etc. . . , which enabled distinct scam types to be distinguished on the basis of very few utterances (see Section VIII).\n\nInterestingly, we noticed that in 3 models (social security number, refund, and support) the state representing casual chit chat is linked with the money/payment related state. The explanation for this can be twofold. We suspect that it may be the scammer's deliberate action to distract the victim from the actual target of the scam (i.e., stealing money -see Fig.  5 : Social security number scam emotion heat map for HMM states. Scores are mean for that state relative to median over all utterances.\n\nSection VI). The second option is that scam baiters actively change the topic of the conversation when the scammer tries to close the scamming attempt with a financial request. It is likely that both have an element of truth.\n\nWe noticed that one of the states for social security number scams adds an interesting variation of the scam that is not present in other types. The \"redirection to supervisor\" state (state 6.) is used to redirect the victim to a second scammer. We suspect that this technique is effective in the social security administration context because of the authoritative position played by the second scammer (usually introduced as senior agent). It would also allow senior, more experienced scammers to be brought to the call for the final stages that lead to payment.",

      "section_name": "B. Weaponized Emotions",
      "text": "Phone scams, unlike other types such as email or SMS, the scammer has greater presence and thus a more direct opportunity to impact victim emotions. From our preliminary examination of data set recordings, we observed that scammers leverage emotion manipulation in their social engineering techniques. Here we present a review of emotions detected in our data as seen from the perspective of inferred states and topics, and attempt to identify the roles they played in the scams, if any. Though we observed that scammers expressed less emotion than scam baiters, none the less variations in how scammers express emotion were evident.\n\nTo measure which state is associated with a particular emotion, we averaged the emotion scores for utterances assigned to the state by the HMM model. Figure  5  and Appendix B present heat maps of relative emotion strengths for each state (relative to the median emotion strength among all utterances for that emotion), providing an indication of where scammer emotion is concentrated. We observe that in many cases there is a concentration of emotion on particular HMM states. This suggests that scammers may indeed use emotions in their social engineering techniques.\n\nIn order to interpret the concentrations of emotion for social security number scams, we examine the highest emotion scoring utterances for each state-emotion pair with higher relative emotion score (see Figure  5 ). Firstly, we examined anger, which was high in \"Call reason high level introduction\" (state 1.) and \"Case and procedure explanation\" (state 9.). We found that scammers try to limit the questions from the victim by making sure they are not interrupted. We found numerous of examples of phrases that angrily enforce victims to not interrupt (e.g., . . . Do not interrupt me in between. . . , . . . Listen to me, do not interrupt me once more. . . , . . . suspend your social for interrupting the officer. . . ). We also noticed that angry language was used in threats presumably to encourage compliance. For example, . . . I will send a local sheriff on your doorstep. . . , . . . I'm sending the cops to your house. . . . The score for the joy emotion is notably high for \"Short utterances (chit chat)\" (state 3.) and \"Initial call greeting\" (state 8.). In the case of initial call greetings, scammers tend to initiate the call with a joyful phrase (e.g., . . . Hello. And thank you for calling. . . ). For the chit chat utterances (state 3) we could not find any common scheme, though we note that chit chat utterances were more emotional overall. This is consistent with the scammer leveraging the victim's desire for connection to increase rapport (the LSD category of social engineering techniques -see Section VI).\n\nThe results for fear clearly show that utterances used to explain the scam theme are meant to trigger fear (states 0,1,2,9). The highest score was found for state 2 -\"Asking about possible identity theft\" (e.g., Have you ever lost it or someone stolen your personal identities from you in Texas? Like your driving license, your social security card, or any of your state ID?). We found scammers suggest that the identity was used in illegal operations, most likely to increase seriousness of the case (e.g., . . . your social security number . . . has been found suspicious for criminal activity.\").\n\nSadness was the most prominent in chit chat utterances (state 3.). We suspect this is because of more compassionate language including apology phrases (e.g., . . . I'm very sorry for the officers who didn't explain to you the case. . . , I'm really sorry for the inconvenience, sir. . . , I'm really sorry. I cannot assure you. . . ), though empathizing with victim sadness also plays a role, for example [after Victim talks about passed husband and family]. . . They are so lucky to have you, so yeah. And you'll live by yourself . . . An outstandingly high score (1.8) was found for disgust for the \"Call reason detailed description\" state. The utterances for this state and emotion contain descriptions of crime scenes such as stolen cars, drugs and blood (e.g., . . . the investigation started when we found an abandoned car . . . and the car contained some blood as well as some drugs . . . ). Interestingly, surprise scores are relatively consistent between states, with no states standing out, and neutral scores are especially so.",

This is achieved by progressively restricting the number of utterances available to the predictive model. Note that we do not attempt to distinguish legitimate calls from scam calls in this work. We use a standard text classifier built on a RoBERTa base model  [30]  from the Huggingface model repository 5 and build a separate binary model for each scam type. We use only scammer utterances for this task. Figure  6  shows recognition performance for the four scam types we investigate. We report F1 scores for the predictors; Precision, recall and accuracy follow similar trajectories. All scam types have strong performance with access to just one utterance (85% -95%) and very strong performance with 5-6 utterances (92% to 98%). Refund and support scams are harder to distinguish than social security number and reward scams. We hypothesise that this is due to greater diversity in the conversations with scam baiters and in variations in specific details of the scams themselves.\n\nThese results match our expectation and demonstrate that effective tools can be built for scam intelligence gathering and applications that operate on live scam calls based on identifying scam types early in a call. There are two main caveats that should be noted here. Firstly, our approach assumes that it is known that a given call is a scam call, however there are effective approaches and tools for detecting scam calls in a live call setting, so we argue that this is not a limitation. Secondly, only four scam types are included here, and the task we perform distinguishes between those four. There are, however, many and diverse phone scams being deployed in the world. We demonstrate that it is possible to distinguish between diverse scam types, as represented by our data, however as 5 https://huggingface.co/roberta-base scams evolve and borrow from each other, we may expect that some scams (and hence, for example, the call centers they operate from) will be more difficult to distinguish.",

We assume we already know which type of scam we are dealing with and wish to track the progression of the call through an already established scam script such as those extracted through the techniques in Section V-C. To demonstrate the feasibility of the task, we wish to predict the stage of a scam call in a simulated live call setting. We train predictive models whose inputs are sequences of scammer utterances up to a point in the transcript and whose target is the scam stage for that utterance as inferred by the appropriate HMM model. We do this separately for each scam type. Since approximate identification of the current position in the scam script is also useful information, we consider a relaxed target that includes the previous scam stage and the succeeding one -that is, the scam stage of the first utterance after (or preceding) the utterance in consideration that has a different scam stage. See Appendix A for details data preparation, model training and evaluation.\n\nOur models achieve a margin of 50% over a random model for social security number and refund scams, and 30% over for support and reward scams (Table  V ). Interestingly, this margin is similar for the strict and relaxed targets. Again we see that support and reward, with less data available, have a lower margin over a random model. It is interesting to note that performance on the strict target is similar across scam types. This at fist seems perplexing, as the task for e.g. social security number scams (SSN) with 11 states is much harder than for reward scams with 5 states. We believe that this is a reflection of the optimization of the HMM models: they efficiently extract the available information, with each extracted state supported by a similar level of information.\n\nWe consider these results to successfully demonstrate that effective tools to track scam stages in a live call setting can be built given sufficient data. Though strict target accuracy around 50% may seem low, we note that to achieve this with many states (11 for social security numbers) is substantially difficult as seen in the margin over a random model, and that most of the \"errors\" are in fact identifying a nearby state in the state sequence.",

      "text": "The sample used for analysis has a number of limitations. Firstly, it only includes YouTube videos of scam calls, most which were recorded by 'scam-baiters', people who aim to waste scammers' time with the full knowledge of the fact that the call was a scam. Therefore, the victim is not behaving genuinely in these calls, albeit the scammer is genuine up to the point they realise the victim is a scam baiter. In particular, scam baiters sometimes seek to lead the scammer into extended conversations irrelevant to the scam -they will play the part of an ideal victim in initial phases of a call, but lead the call astray more and more as the call progresses, leading to noisy results towards the later stages of calls. Another limitation is that published scam baiting videos are edited during the post-production process. Edits such as merging a few calls in a single video or removing pieces of conversation make the extraction of the scam calls more challenging. Particularly some scam baiters include their own comments (directed to the audience) that pollute the scam call conversation. Although efforts have been made to remove these issues by manually removing less relevant parts of the recordings that are not indicative of a typical scam call, as well as splitting scripts containing excerpts from multiple calls, some of these features may persist in the data. We also note that some scam baiters may cherry-pick the calls the choose to post on YouTube, however this is probably a good thing, as it acts as a filter for shorter conversations where the scammer quickly recognises that the call is not bona-fide. The inherent bias that results must, however, be acknowledged.\n\nThe capabilities of the video transcribing and diarisation service are also limited and transcripts are prone to errors such as mis-attributing utterances to speakers, incorrectly identifying words used and utterance boundaries, and not recognising very short utterances (instead merging them with the preceding and following utterances). In some cases, the diarisation process returned more than 2 speakers which increased the overall workload of correctly identifying scammer's utterances. Again, although efforts have been made to correct these errors during the manual transcript cleanup, some errors still persist. We note that the capabilities of state of the art text to speech services are steadily improving, and expect these issues to be reduced in future.\n\nOne feature of many of the calls that challenges audio transcription is the scammer and scam baiter talking over each other. In these cases, the transcription tool usually identifies just one speaker, occasionally with a word or two injected from the other. This can be extremely difficult to accurately transcribe, even for human transcriptions. Sourcing call data where the scammer and victim are in separate audio channels would remove this problem and allow for analysis of the causes and impact of this interesting phenomenon.\n\nThe data covers relatively few scam types, all of which are from the United States. None the less, it suffices to demonstrate the practicality of recognizing and extracting scam scripts and distinguishing scam types across a selection of common scam types. The uneven proportion of the types of scam transcripts in our data set influences the granularity of the information from our analysis. This is particularly visible for reward scams, which had only 23 transcript samples. Although instructive of the need for more data to obtain quality analyses, it remains a limitation of this work.\n\nThe fact that the emotion detection model used is a text only model presents another limitation. Such models are not capable of detecting prosodic emotion signals (characteristics related to the tone, pitch, accent and other paralinguistic voice features) and rely solely on the words used.",

Directly engaging with scam baiters and recruiting people to engage in scam baiting would allow even larger and more timely data sets.\n\nAnother approach to obtain greater volumes of data as well as more timely data (for example data for new scam types shortly after they appear) could be to train conversational AI to perform scam baiting via telephony honeypots. We believe that recent advances in conversational AI have reached the stage where this has become an effective strategy.\n\nCriminal organisations that specialise in phone scams are constantly evolving by implementing new technical and social engineering techniques. Moreover, they adjust the scam campaigns to take advantage of recent events (e.g., the pandemic crisis).
