      "text": "The COVID-19 pandemic has undoubtedly changed the standards and affected all aspects of our lives, especially social communication. It has forced people to extensively wear medical face masks, in order to prevent transmission. This face occlusion can strongly irritate emotional reading from the face and urges us to incorporate the whole body as an emotional cue. In this paper, we conduct insightful studies about the effect of face occlusion on emotion recognition performance, and showcase the superiority of full body input over the plain masked face. We utilize a deep learning model based on the Temporal Segment Network framework, and aspire to fully overcome the face mask consequences. Although facial and bodily features can be learned from a single input, this may lead to irrelevant information confusion. By processing those features separately and fusing their prediction scores, we are more effectively taking advantage of both modalities. This framework also naturally supports temporal modeling, by mingling information among neighboring frames. In combination, these techniques form an effective system capable of tackling emotion recognition difficulties, caused by safety protocols applied in crucial areas.",

      "text": "The possible applications of an interface capable of assessing human emotional states are numerous. Humans generally treat computer agents as they might treat other people  [32] . Robots and systems that are able to recognize, interpret and process human affect  [5] , are arguably well suited to this, making the interaction more effective and pleasant. They find fertile ground in the area of computer-assisted education, as learning is the quintessential emotional experience. A learning episode might begin with curiosity and fascination. But as its difficulty increases, one may experience confusion, frustration or anxiety, and thus, may abandon learning  [29] . A tutoring agent, who is able to estimate the learner's affective state, can respond appropriately and give encouraging suggestions. Existing work has shown that robot tutors enhance learning, by personalizing their motivational strategies to the student's emotional behavior  [13]    [20] . Another crucial area is health care, as mental health disorders, like depression and psychosis, are on the rise across the world. Emotion recognition systems can be an effective strategy for preventing and monitoring such disorders  [38] .\n\nWhile works based on facial expressions abound in the area, recognizing affect from the body remains a less explored topic. A study in neurobiology has shown that body movement and posture contain useful features for recognizing human affect  [8] . In other experiments, it was shown that facial and bodily expressions work complementary for visual perception of emotion, and in some cases humans perceive bodily expressed emotional information as more diagnostic than facial  [2] . Furthermore, the visibility of facial cues is not guaranteed. Bodily expression recognition becomes crucial when facial features are occluded. Medical face masks, which are extensively used nowadays due to the COVID-19 pandemic  [6] , are the epitome of face occlusion. Because bodies are more expressive than faces in those situations, social information can be detected from the body instead.\n\nAlthough there has been a considerable amount of research on automatic emotion recognition in adults, the topic regarding children has been understudied. Children go through a critical development process and applications involving them require special attention  [31] . They also tend to fidget and move around more than adults, leading to more self-occlusions and non-frontal head poses  [4] . This becomes even more challenging, considering the current health and safety protocols that demand the use of face masks. Robots can no longer rely only on facial expressions to recognize emotion, but also have to take into account body expressions that can stay visible and detectable, even when the face is unobservable. Children's behavior and natural characteristics differ from adults, so perception systems need to be specifically trained, to be able to tackle Child-Robot Interaction (CRI) problems.\n\nThe rest of the paper is organized as follows: Section 2 discusses related work on emotion recognition mainly from the body. Section 3 describes the adopted deep learning-based visual emotion recognition model in detail, as well as the tools and methods used for the experiments. Section 4 presents the experimental results, and lastly Section 5 provides our conclusions.",

      "text": "In recent years, deep learning methods have been very popular due to the massive amounts of digital data in combination with powerful processing hardware. Deep extracted features have yielded excellent results and on most cases outperformed non-deep state-ofthe-art methods for the emotion recognition task. When processing a video with emotional expressions, an essential component is capturing temporal information to complement the prediction from still images. Two-stream Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) architectures use multi-frame optical flow to handle complex actions like emotional expressions  [34] .\n\nThe most common modality used by the research community for identifying emotion is facial expressions  [21] . Some works have proposed an audiovisual approach  [12] , where the system takes speech as an additional input to the face, in order to tackle occlusions and increase robustness. In  [26] , they utilize 3D CNNs to extract spatiotemporal features both from face videos and audio signals, and deep belief nets  [17]  for emotion recognition. However, the COVID-19 pandemic has fostered a pervasive use of medical face masks all around the world, making a serious impact on social communication. Several studies investigated how the presence of a face mask affects emotion recognition accuracy and revealed that it diminishes the people's ability to accurately categorize a facial expression  [6]    [14] . On top of that, the mask impairs re-identification of the same face by people  [24] , which suggests a need for mask-specific model training. In  [35] , they also explored how masks influence the perceived emotional profile of facial expressions. It was shown, that it not only led to a decrease in perceived intensity of the intended emotions, but it also resulted in an overall increase in the perceived intensity of non-intended emotions. In  [28] , even super-recognizers, people who are highly skilled and superior in recognition tasks, were impaired by the face occlusion caused by the face mask. This negative effect in emotional reading is not limited to adults, as it also concerns interaction with children  [7] .\n\nMotivated by all the above, we move towards incorporating bodily expressed information as a major cue in the emotion recognition task. An early work  [15]  combined handcrafted face and body features at feature and decision-level for emotion classification. In  [10] , a hierarchical multi-label annotation method was proposed, which fused body skeleton with facial expressions for automatic recognition of emotion of children during CRI scenarios. In  [23] , they experimented with two bodily expression pipelines, one of which implemented a two-stream-based CNN. The other one relied solely on the human skeleton and utilized a spatial-temporal Graph Convolutional Network (GCN)  [37] , which constructs a graph from the human body landmarks with their natural spatial connectivity, as well as temporally neighboring landmarks.\n\nAlong with body, context has been an additional modality involved in the task of emotion recognition. In  [11] , RGB and flow body streams were accompanied with a context RGB stream and a visual-semantic embedding loss based on word embedding representations. In  [18] , they proposed a network structure composed of a GCN processing skeleton landmarks, and two 3D CNNs for RGB body and context input. A network ensemble, including streams that processed the body in RGB, flow and skeleton form was proposed in  [30] . This variety of bodily expressed cues have also been involved in CRI emotion recognition systems  [9]    [25] .\n\nOur work focuses on the effect of the face occlusion on emotion recognition performance. We adopt a proven related work model and process only RGB input, despite the diversity of body cues that can be conveyed. We sense that this approach suits best to our purpose, regarding the medical face mask effect study.",

On the other hand, each expressed emotion is not present throughout a whole input video. These facts, indicate that we are in need of effective general feature capturing. While the plain CNN architecture considers the whole input sequence, as well as each frame in the video separately, the Temporal Segment Network (TSN) framework  [36]  operates on a sequence of short snippets sparsely sampled from the entire video. Each snippet in this sequence will produce its own preliminary prediction of the emotion classes and then, a consensus among the snippets will be derived as the video-level prediction. Therefore, it allows the network to access several parts of the video, but also tackles the inability of the former to model long-range temporal structure, thus, being more likely to observe the corresponding expression.",

Each snippet 𝑇 𝑘 is produced, by randomly sampling 3 consecutive frames from its corresponding segment 𝑆 𝑘 , to tackle frame redundancy. Finally, a segmental consensus function H is applied on the snippet-level predictions produced by the backbone, to obtain the final scores 𝑆:\n\nHere F (𝑇 𝑘 ; W) denotes the function representing the application of a CNN with parameters W on the snippet 𝑇 𝑘 . The CNN is equipped with a ResNet-50 backbone architecture  [16] . The consensus function H we use is average pooling and the obtained video-level scores 𝑆 are fed to a loss function L to perform the training step. This framework offers several benefits to emotion recognition. Compared to processing the entire video, the sampling process ignores redundant information in consecutive video frames, helping avoid overfitting, and offers a type of data augmentation, valuable for children emotion databases of small size.",

Each video is annotated with one or more emotions, from a total of 8 emotion labels: Curiosity, Uncertainty, Excitement, Happiness, Surprise, Disgust, Fear, and Frustration. Therefore, we are dealing with a CRI binary multi-label classification problem. In Fig.  2 , we show the imbalance of EmoReact's training set, which means it includes an unequal number of videos for each emotion label, and is something that we must address in our upcoming model configuration choices. We can also argue that some emotions (Fear, Frustration, Disgust) are expressed in a relatively low number of samples, which results in possible lack of diversity and less ease to generalize well across unseen individuals, introducing an extra degree of difficulty to our problem.",

We track the 2D coordinates of the right and left jawline vertices, starting from just below the eyes until the chin, and one extra vertex for the nose, in order to form a polygon that is finally filled to represent the mask (Fig.  3 ). The jawlines for the mask are created by tracking the edge x-axis vertices and accordingly selecting among several jawline candidates, that we manually created for this particular face mesh model 1  . In Fig.  4 , we display several samples of EmoReact after the application of the mask and showcase our tool's robustness to face orientation.",

After producing the scores 𝑆 𝑓 and 𝑆 𝑏 from face and plain body respectively, we use a late fusion scheme to obtain the final scores 𝑆.

This architecture naturally supports temporal modeling, by mingling information among neighboring snippet frames with the Temporal Shift Module (TSM)  [22] . TSM can be inserted into CNNs, to exploit temporality at zero computation and parameters. It shifts part of the channels of the input frames and the latent representations of each snippet along the temporal dimension, both forward and backward, thus facilitate information exchange among neighboring frames. Because information contained in the channels is no longer accessible for the current frame, the spatial modeling ability of the backbone can be harmed. To address this problem, the module is placed inside the residual branches of the ResNet, so the information in the original activation is still accessible after temporal shift, through the identity mappings.",

These results suggest that the model can exploit body information in such a way, that even with the application of a face mask, and consequently face information loss, it only suffers minimal performance drop. We also note the same pattern of performance with the masked face input results, which is better performance as complexity goes up. However, performance increase from 3 to 10 segments is minimal (0.1%), which again suggests working towards the speed side of the trade-off.  input gives superior results over face crop. With black we highlight the best overall result, whereas with blue we highlight the result of the suggested optimal model, regarding the performance vs speed trade-off discussed earlier.

For Fear, performance is a lot higher with full body compared to face, which intuitively makes sense as children tend to utilize their body more to express fear  [10] . Happiness is not conventionally an emotion with intense expressions, as most people think of just a simple smile, which is obstructed by the mask, but the model manages to recognize it at a decent level. Another conclusion we could come up to is that for some emotion pairs, like Curiosity-Uncertainty or Excitement-Surprise, which intuitively are quite similar to each other, performance might be lower for each emotion individually, because it is harder for the model to distinguish one from the other.",

We provide some example frames of the activation mapping, where model focus increases from blue to red. Starting from the face examples (Fig.  8 ), we can see that the model focuses on the upper part of the face. The facial features Regarding the body examples (Fig.  9 ), the arms become visible and provide information that is utilized by the model. The bodily features that could be utilized are the hands (calm for Happiness, aroused for Excitement, investigating for Curiosity, fist for Frustration), the arms (wide open for Excitement), and the shoulders (shrugged for Curiosity).\n\nIn Fig.  10 , we present several examples where the model focuses not only the body, but also on the face, fusing different modality information to make predictions. This suggests that it is able to learn both facial and bodily features in a single RGB stream.\n\nOverall, the model has learned to ignore noisy features, like the mask and the background. It is crucial to note, that the background is considered noise in this dataset, as the videos were recorded in a directed setup and it can be the same for different reaction topics.
