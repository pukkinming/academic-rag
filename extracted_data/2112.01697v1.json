      "text": "Learning modality-fused representations and processing unaligned multimodal sequences are meaningful and challenging in multimodal emotion recognition. Existing approaches use directional pairwise attention or a message hub to fuse language, visual, and audio modalities.

      "text": "Multimodal emotion recognition has attracted increasing attention due to its robustness and remarkable performance  (Nguyen et al. 2018; Poria et al. 2020; Dai et al. 2021b) . The goal of this task is to recognize human emotions from video clips, which involves three main modalities: natural language, facial expressions and audio signals. Emotion recognition is applied in areas such as social robotics, educational quality assessment, and healthcare, where the analysis of emotion is particularly important during COVID-19  (Chandra and Krishna 2021) . Multimodality provides a wealth of information compared to single modality and can fully reflect emotional states. However, due to the different sampling rates of sequences from different modalities, Figure  1 : Comparisons of different methods on CMU-MOSEI in terms of F1 score and the number of parameters. The proposed LMR-CBT model achieves the best performance with an order of magnitude smaller model size.\n\nthe collected multimodal states are often unaligned. Manually aligning different modalities is often labor-intensive and requires domain knowledge  (Tsai et al. 2019b; Pham et al. 2019 ). In addition, most of the networks with high performance cannot achieve a balance between the number of parameters and performance. To this end, we focus on the ability to learn the representation of fused modalities and efficiently perform multimodal emotion recognition on unaligned sequences.\n\nIn the previous works  (Sahay et al. 2020; Rahman et al. 2020; Hazarika, Zimmermann, and Poria 2020; Yu et al. 2021; Dai et al. 2021a) , Transformers  (Vaswani et al. 2017)  are mostly used for unaligned multimodal emotion recognition. Typically,  Tsai et al. (2019a)  proposed the Multimodal Transformer (MulT) method to fuse information from different modalities in unaligned sequences without explicitly aligning the data. The approach learns the interactions between pairs of elements through a cross-modal attention module that iteratively reinforces features of one modality with features of other modalities. Recently,  Lv et al. (2021)  proposed the Progressive Modality Reinforcement (PMR) by introducing a message hub to exchange information with each modality. The approach uses a progressive strategy to utilize high-level source modality information for unaligned multimodal sequences fusion. However, MulT only considers the fusion of features between modality pairs, ignoring the coordination of the three modalities. Besides, using a pairwise approach to fuse the modal features can produce redundant information. For example, the visual representations are repeated twice in the concatenation of visual-language features and visual-audio features. PMR considers the association among the three modalities, but fusing the modal features by designing a centralized message hub would sacrifice its efficiency. To be more specific, the information of the three modalities needs to interact closely and recursively with the message hub to ensure the integrity of the features, and such an operation requires a huge number of parameters. Meanwhile, this approach does not take into account the complementarity between modal information, while feature fusion can be accomplished by simply using the interaction between modalities without introducing a third party. What's more, recent methods are too high in the number of parameters to be applicable to realistic scenarios due to pre-trained models.\n\nTherefore, to address the above limitations, we propose a neural network to learn modality-fused representations with CB-Transformer (LMR-CBT) for multimodal emotion recognition from unaligned multimodal sequences. Figure  2  shows the overall architecture of LMR-CBT. Specifically, we first perform feature extraction for the three modalities respectively to obtain the local structure of the sequences. For the audio and visual modalities, we obtain information about adjacent elements by 1D temporal convolution. For the language modality, we use Bi-directional Long and Short Term Memory (BiLSTM) to capture the long term dependencies and the contextual information between texts.\n\nAfter obtaining feature representations of the three modalities, we design a novel transformer with cross-modal blocks (CB-Transformer) to achieve complementary learning of the different modalities, which is mainly divided into local temporal learning, cross-modal feature fusion and global self-attention representations. In the local temporal learning part, audio and visual features are used to obtain adjacent element-dependent representations of the two modalities through the transformer. In the cross-modal feature fusion part, residual-based modal interaction approach is used to obtain the fused features of the three modalities. In the global self-attention representations part, the transformer learns high-level representations within the fusion modality. The CB-Transformer can adequately represent the fused features without losing the original features and can efficiently handle unaligned multimodal sequences. Finally, we splice the modal fusion features with the original features to obtain the emotional categories. We perform wordaligned and unaligned experiments on three mainstream public datasets of multimodal emotion recognition, IEMO-CAP  (Busso et al. 2008) , CMU-MOSI  (Zadeh et al. 2016b ) and CMU-MOSEI  (Zadeh et al. 2018 ). The experimental results demonstrate the superiority of our proposed method. Moreover, we achieve a better trade-off between the performance and the efficiency. Compared with the mainstream methods, our approach reaches the state-of-the-art with a minimum number of parameters.\n\nWe summarize our three main contributions as follows:\n\n• We propose an efficient neural network to learn modalityfused representations with CB-Transformer (LMR-CBT)\n\nfor multimodal emotion recognition from unaligned multimodal sequences (only 0.41M), which can effectively fuse the interactive information of the three modalities. • We design a novel transformer with cross-modal blocks (CB-Transformer) to achieve complementary learning of different modalities, which is mainly divided into local temporal learning, cross-modal feature fusion and global self-attention representations. The CB-Transformer can adequately represent the fused features without losing the original features and can efficiently handle unaligned multimodal sequences. • We obtain a better trade-off between the performance and the efficiency on three challenging datasets. Compared with the existing state-of-the-art methods, LMR-CBT achieves comparable or even higher performance with a minimal number of parameters.",

      "text": "Multimodal emotion recognition has attracted a lot of attention in recent years. This task requires the fusion of crossmodal information of temporal sequential signals. According to the approaches of feature fusion, it can be divided into early fusion  (Morency, Mihalcea, and Doshi 2011; Pérez-Rosas, Mihalcea, and Morency 2013) , late fusion  (Zadeh et al. 2016a; Wang et al. 2017 ) and model fusion. Previous works have focused on early or late fusion strategies. Early fusion strategies involve fusing the shallow intermodal features and focusing on mixed-modal feature processing while late fusion strategies involve finding the confidence level of each modality and then coordinating them to make joint decisions. Although better performance can be obtained using these fusion strategies in comparison to single modality learning, they do not explicitly consider the intrinsic connection between sequence elements from different modalities, which is essential for effective multimodal fusion. Subsequently, model fusion is gradually applied and more complicated models are proposed.  Wang et al. (2019)  used visual and auditory features to shift words in text with attention. Rahman et al. (  2020 ) introduced a multimodal adaptive gate that integrates visual and acoustic information into a large pretrained language model. Hazarika, Zimmermann, and Poria (2020) incorporated a combination of losses including distributional similarity, orthogonal loss, reconstruction loss and task prediction loss to learn modality-invariant and modality-specific representation.  Dai et al. (2021b)  introduced sparse cross-attention to achieve end-to-end emotion recognition.  Dai et al. (2021a)  proposed a multi-task learning approach using weak supervision for multimodal emotion recognition.  Yu et al. (2021)  proposed a way to fuse features from different modalities by combining self-supervised and multi-task learning. Although selfsupervised and multi-task learning can effectively alleviate the problem of small samples, how to perform efficient cross-modal interactions is still a tremendously challenging issue for researchers. Therefore, the main motivation of this work is how to perform unaligned multimodal emotion recognition with a minimalist design excluding tricks like self-supervision or multi-tasking.\n\nIn order to fuse the information of unaligned multimodal sequences, early works have explored the dependencies between modal elements based on the maximum modal information criterion  (Zeng et al. 2005) . However, the performance of those early approaches is far from satisfactory due to the shallow model structures.  Tsai et al. (2019a)  proposed a multimodal transformer (MulT) to learn intermodal correlations using a cross-modal attention mechanism.  Sahay et al. (2020)  proposed low rank fusion based transformers (LMT-MULT) to design LMF units for efficient modal feature fusion based on previous work.  Lv et al. (2021)  proposed progressive modality reinforcement (PMR) method. This method uses a message hub to interact with the three modal information and adopts the progressive strategy to fuse unaligned multimodal temporal sequences utilizing high level source modal information. Although those previous trials have made some performance improvement in unaligned multimodal emotion recognition, they still faces the problems of effective fusion of cross-modal features and the inability to ensure that information is not lost. In this paper, we mainly focus on reaching an accuracy-parameter balance by a novel information redundancy-free modal fusion strategy.",

      "text": "We propose a neural network to learn modality-fused representations with CB-Transformer (LMR-CBT), and the overall architecture of the network is shown in Figure  2 , where the cross-modal blocks and transformer encoder in CB-Transformer are located on the two sides of the figure, respectively. Next, we will describe the network in detail.\n\nFeature Preprocessing. The feature preprocessing is performed separately according to the temporal structure of the different modalities. For audio and visual modalities, to ensure that each element in the input sequence has sufficient perception of its neighboring elements, we put the two modalities into 1D temporal convolution separately by setting different convolution kernel sizes. The specific formula is as follows:\n\n(1) where BN stands for batch normalization, and k {V,A} is the size of the convolution kernel of modality {V, A}, and d f represents a common dimension.\n\nIn terms of language modality, we consider that the language itself is characterized by long-time dependencies and associative contextual information. BiLSTM can better capture bidirectional long-time semantic dependencies and identify the emotional representations of languages. We use a two-layer BiLSTM for feature extraction:\n\n(2) where LN represents layer normalization. The purpose of layer normalization is to stabilize the distribution of each layer so that subsequent layers can learn the content of the previous layer in a stable manner. By the above operation, on the one hand, we can aggregate the features of adjacent elements, and on the other hand, we can pre-align the feature dimensions of unaligned multimodal data to the same dimension.\n\nTransformer with Cross-modal Blocks. We design a novel transformer with cross-modal blocks (CB-Transformer). CB-Transformer is divided into three parts: local temporal learning, cross-modal feature fusion and global self-attention representations. In this module, there are two important components: the transformer encoder and the residual-based cross-modal fusion, represented using T ransEncoder and CrossM odal, respectively. For both components we will discuss in detail in Section 3.3 and 3.4.\n\nIn the local temporal learning, we use the transformer encoder, which is becoming increasingly popular in many areas such as computer vision and natural language processing due to its noticeable performance. We use this component to obtain temporal representations of audio and visual modality features that have undergone 1D temporal convolution. The specific process can be expressed by the following formula:\n\n{V,A} = X{V,A} + P E(T {v,a} , d f )\n\n(3)\n\nwhere P E(T {v,a} , d f ) ∈ R T {v,a} ×d f computes the embeddings for each position index, and\n\n{V,A} represents the result embedded through position, and T ransEncoder represents the transformer encoder, which we will discuss in detail in Section 3.3. We use F {V,A} to represent the result of local temporal learning.\n\nIn the part of cross-modal feature fusion, we design a residual-based cross-modal fusion method, which takes F {V,A} and XL as inputs and the fused representation of the three modalities as outputs. The structure of residual can ensure that information is not lost. The specific formula is as follows:\n\nwhere CrossM odal represents the residual-based crossmodal fusion, which we will discuss in detail in Section 3.4, and XF denotes the fusion features. We believe that the fused modal representation not only carries information from the language modality, but also fuses information from Algorithm 1 The algorithm of cross-modal fusion Input: the audio and video modal representation with local temporal learning F {V,A} ∈ R d f ; the language representation with BiLSTM processing: XL ∈ R T l ×d f ; the batch size bs.\n\nOutput: the features that fuse the representation of the three modalities and the original text representation: XF ∈ R T l ×d f . 1: F {V,A} = Linear(F {V,A} ); 2: Let attn softmax = [];\n\n3: Let i = 0; 4: while i < bs do 5:\n\nattn softmax.append( X * F ); 9: end while 10: XF = Concat(attn softmax). 11: return XF . all the three modalities to ensure effective interaction of information. Similarly, Transformer Encoder is used to extract the representation of the fused features in the global selfattention representations.\n\nThrough global self-attention representations, we can obtain high-level complementary representations of the fused modalities. The specific formula is as follows:\n\n(6) where F F represents the global self-attention learning results for fused representations.\n\nPrediction. We carry out the emotion category prediction. Specifically, we perform a splicing operation on the fused modal representation and the audio/visual original modal representation to obtain I = [F F , F A , F V ]. After that, we get the final output of the emotional category through the two-layer fully connected network:\n\nwhere d out is the output dimensions of emotional categories, W 1 ∈ R d f * 3 and W 1 ∈ R dout are weight vectors, b 1 and b 2 are the bias, σ denotes the ReLU activation function.",

Among these methods, LF-LSTM, MulT, LMF-MulT, and PMR can be directly applied the unaligned setting. For the other methods, we introduce the connectionist temporal classification (CTC)  (Graves et al. 2006 ) module to make them applicable to unaligned settings.\n\nWord-aligned setting. This setting requires manual alignment of language words with visual and audio. We show the comparison of our method with other benchmarks in the upper part of Tables  3 4 5 . The experimental results show that the proposed method achieves a comparable performance level to PMR  (Lv et al. 2021 ) on different metrics for the three datasets. Compared with LMF-MulT  (Sahay et al. 2020) , which uses six transformer encoders, we achieve better performance on different datasets using half of the transformer encoders.\n\nUnaligned setting. This setting is more challenging than the word-aligned setting, where cross-modal information is extracted directly from unaligned multimodal sequences to classify emotions. We show the comparison of our approach with other benchmarks in the lower part of Tables  3 4 5 .
