      "text": "This paper presents our contributions to the Speech Emotion Recognition in Naturalistic Conditions (SERNC) Challenge, where we address categorical emotion recognition and emotional attribute prediction. To handle the complexities of natural speech, including intra-and inter-subject variability, we propose Multi-level Acoustic-Textual Emotion Representation (MATER)-a novel hierarchical framework that integrates acoustic and textual features at the word, utterance, and embedding levels. By fusing low-level lexical and acoustic cues with high-level contextualized representations, MATER effectively captures both fine-grained prosodic variations and semantic nuances. Additionally, we introduce an uncertainty-aware ensemble strategy to mitigate annotator inconsistencies, improving robustness in ambiguous emotional expressions. MATER ranks fourth in both tasks with a Macro-F1 of 41.01% and an average CCC of 0.5928, securing second place in valence prediction with an impressive CCC of 0.6941.",

      "text": "Emotions are fundamental to human experience, influencing decision-making, communication, and mental well-being  [1] . Speech, as the most common form of communication, conveys a rich blend of emotional cues, including speaker identity, affect, and linguistic emphasis  [2] . Consequently, speech emotion recognition (SER) has gained significant attention over the past two decades for its ability to recognize emotions across categorical labels  [3]  or continuous emotional dimensions  [4] .\n\nDespite extensive research, most SER datasets fail to fully capture real-world emotional expressions, as they are often composed of acted  [5, 6, 7]  or elicited  [8, 9]  recordings. Even datasets featuring natural speech  [10, 11, 12]  are often constrained by a limited number of participants, reducing their generalizability to diverse real-world scenarios. To address these issues, the MSP-Podcast corpus  [13] , provided in the Speech Emotion Recognition in Naturalistic Conditions (SERNC) Challenge  [14] , offers natural speech from 2,826 speakers, supporting two tasks: Task 1 (Categorical Emotion Recognition) and Task 2 (Emotional Attribute Prediction).\n\nOne of the primary challenges in naturalistic SER is developing representations that are robust to intra-and inter-speaker variability while effectively capturing the complexity of emotional expression. To address this, we introduce Multi-level Acoustic and Textual Emotion Representation (MATER)-a novel hierarchical framework that integrates acoustic and tex-",

As illustrated in Figure  1 , MATER systematically models emotions at three distinct levels: 1) Wordlevel: Extracting syntax-aware prosodic cues to capture the finegrained interplay between linguistic structure and intonation.\n\n2) Utterance-level: Analyzing sentiment and rhythmic patterns over the entire speech segment to capture both lexical meaning and overall emotional nuances. 3) Embedding-level: Leveraging pretrained deep models (e.g., WavLM, HuBERT) to derive context-sensitive and speaker-invariant representations for better generalization. This multi-level framework enables MATER to model emotions from low-level syntactic and prosodic cues to high-level contextualized representations, effectively integrating both speech and text for robust emotion modeling.\n\nA further challenge in SER with natural speech arises from overlapping, ambiguous, and highly variable emotional expressions, which often hinder annotator consensus. This inconsistency introduces confidence disparities and biases across emotion categories. To tackle this, we propose a novel uncertaintyaware ensemble that improves robustness by selecting emotion predictions with the least uncertainty, thereby mitigating annotation biases and enhancing reliability.\n\nMATER achieves high-ranking performance in both tasks of the SERNC Challenge, with a Macro-F1 of 41.01% and an average CCC of 0.5928.

      "text": "This study utilizes the MSP-Podcast corpus  [13] , provided by the organizers of the SERNC Challenge. This dataset contains short naturalistic speech segments extracted from podcasts. The dataset is annotated for two tasks: 1. Categorical Emotion Recognition-Speech segments are labeled into eight emotion categories; Angry (A), Contempt (C), Disgust (D), Fear (F), Happy (H), Neutral (N), Sad (S), and Surprise (U). Samples labeled as \"Other\" or those lacking annotator agreement are excluded. 2. Emotional Attribute Prediction-Speech is rated on a sevenpoint Likert scale along three emotional dimensions: arousal (calm to active), dominance (weak to strong), and valence (negative to positive). The train and development sets contain 84,260 samples from 2,112 speakers and 31,961 samples from 714 speakers, respectively. The test set comprises 3,200 balanced samples across eight emotion categories. However, unlike the train and development sets, it does not provide transcripts or additional metadata. To ensure consistency, we generate transcripts and forced alignments for all sets using Whisper-large-v3  [15] .\n\nGiven its real-world nature, the dataset presents challenges such as class imbalance and inconsistent annotation consensus across emotion categories, as illustrated in Figure  2 . To address the class imbalance, we evaluate models using the average performance across five in-house test sets, each randomly sampled from the development set with 326 samples per emotion. Additionally, to manage annotation uncertainties, we introduce a novel ensemble strategy that employs a non-parametric approach to enhance prediction reliability.",

Each level captures complementary information, enabling the model to learn both fine-grained speech patterns and high-level contextual cues. The following sections detail each feature level. Word-level Word-level features encode both syntactic and prosodic aspects of speech. A BERTweet-based syntactic parser  [16]  extracts linguistic patterns, including grammatical person information for pronouns, forming a 20-dimensional syntactic feature vector per word. To capture prosodic variations, a 22dimensional feature vector is extracted using the openSMILE library  [17] , incorporating attributes like loudness, jitter, shimmer, alpha ratio, and voiced/unvoiced segment statistics. By concatenating these features, MATER creates a syntax-aware prosodic representation, allowing the model to learn the interplay between linguistic structure and intonation, which plays a crucial role in emotion expression.",

Sentiment features are derived from the SEANCE feature set  [18] , producing a 517dimensional representation that encapsulates affective tendencies across the entire transcript. Rhythmic features, on the other hand, are extracted to analyze the flow, intensity, and nuances of speech. These include loudness, jitter, shimmer, Harmonicto-Noise Ratio (HNR), pauses, and voiced/unvoiced segment statistics, resulting in a 34-dimensional feature vector. By incorporating both sentiment and rhythm, the model captures not only the meaning of words but also how they are delivered, which is critical for distinguishing subtle emotional variations.\n\nEmbedding-level Embedding-level features leverage pretrained audio and text encoders to derive context-sensitive and speaker-invariant representations. The audio encoders, WavLM  [19]  and HuBERT  [20] , capture rich phonetic and prosodic information, while the text encoders, BERT  [21]  and T5  [22] , provide semantically informed representations of spoken content.\n\nTo enhance domain adaptation, we post-pretrain these encoders on the MSP-Podcast corpus, following the baseline's strategy of fine-tuning WavLM with attentive statistics pooling  [23] . Empirical results confirm that models trained with domain-adapted embeddings improve SER performance.",

At the embedding-level, when multiple embedding sources are used, a Perceiver architecture  [26]  fuses them into a single representation. Otherwise, the pooled features are used directly without additional processing. Finally, the concatenated multi-level embeddings are fed into linear layers to predict emotion categories or continuous emotional attributes, providing a comprehensive and context-aware emotion representation.",

These factors contribute to annotation inconsistencies, leading to biased predictions and reduced model reliability.\n\nCertain emotions, such as contempt and disgust, exhibit lower annotator consensus, resulting in unstable confidence scores and high misclassification errors. Previous attempts, such as Shamsi et al.  [27] , sought to mitigate these biases by optimizing decision thresholds, but such approaches often lead to overfitting and fail to generalize across diverse evaluation sets.\n\nTo address this issue, we introduce a novel uncertaintyaware ensemble strategy designed for balanced evaluation sets. Instead of tuning the decision thresholds, we estimate epistemic uncertainty by ranking predicted probabilities within each emotion category. The final ensemble prediction is obtained by averaging these rank-based uncertainties from the top-performing models across feature combinations, prioritizing high-confidence predictions. This approach reduces ambiguity and ensures robust predictions across emotion categories, even with biased label consensus. Additionally, unlike parametric methods, our rank-based method requires no additional optimization, making it inherently adaptable and generalizable across datasets. These advantages provide a scalable and reliable solution for improving SER in real-world settings. The detailed ensemble process is outlined in Algorithm 1.",

As shown in Table  2 , valence prediction improves significantly, whereas gains in arousal and dominance remain limited. This aligns with the intuition that valence is more text-dependent, while arousal and dominance are driven by acoustic cues.

Despite this, MATER remains competitive across all emotional dimensions, achieving a strong overall ranking.",

At the embeddinglevel, optimal encoders differ across tasks, emphasizing the need for task-specific encoder selection. Additionally, multimodal fusion in MATER enhances performance at the word and utterance levels, confirming its effectiveness in integrating  acoustic and textual cues. These findings suggest that adaptive feature weighting or task-driven feature selection could further optimize MATER's performance. Given that arousal and dominance rely more on acoustic cues, a dynamic fusion strategy balancing audio-text integration may yield additional gains.",
