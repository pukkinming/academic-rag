      "text": "OpenAI has released the Chat Generative Pre-trained Transformer (ChatGPT) and revolutionized the approach in artificial intelligence to human-model interaction. The first contact with the chatbot reveals its ability to provide detailed and precise answers in various areas. Several publications on ChatGPT evaluation test its effectiveness on well-known natural language processing (NLP) tasks. However, the existing studies are mostly non-automated and tested on a very limited scale. In this work, we examined ChatGPT's capabilities on 25 diverse analytical NLP tasks, most of them subjective even to humans, such as sentiment analysis, emotion recognition, offensiveness, and stance detection. In contrast, the other tasks require more objective reasoning like word sense disambiguation, linguistic acceptability, and question answering. We also evaluated GPT-4 model on five selected subsets of NLP tasks. We automated ChatGPT and GPT-4 prompting process and analyzed more than 49k responses. Our comparison of its results with available State-of-the-Art (SOTA) solutions showed that the average loss in quality of the ChatGPT model was about 25% for zero-shot and few-shot evaluation. For GPT-4 model, a loss for semantic tasks is significantly lower than for ChatGPT. We showed that the more difficult the task (lower SOTA performance), the higher the ChatGPT loss. It especially refers to pragmatic NLP problems like emotion recognition. We also tested the ability to personalize ChatGPT responses for selected subjective tasks via Random Contextual Few-Shot Personalization, and we obtained significantly better user-based predictions. Additional qualitative analysis revealed a ChatGPT bias, most likely due to the rules imposed on human trainers by OpenAI. Our results provide the basis for a fundamental discussion of whether the high quality of recent predictive NLP models can indicate a tool's usefulness to society and how the learning and validation procedures for such systems should be established.",

      "text": "In recent years, Transformer-type model architecture has dominated the world of natural language processing (NLP)  [1, 2, 3] . Before that, recurrent neural networks, such as LSTMs, were used to solve a wide variety of existing NLP problems  [4, 5, 6] . The recurrent neural models could not capture distant dependencies in data sequences, for example, information occurring at the text beginning or end  [7] . In addition, their architecture did not allow for efficient parallelization of training and inference processes  [8] . The answer to the aforementioned problems was precisely the Transformer architecture, presented initially as an encoderdecoder model for sequence-to-sequence tasks  [1] . Such a model had the advantage of capturing distant relationships in the text using an attentional mechanism and easily parallelizing calculations with matrix operations. As more powerful GPUs and TPUs were developed  [9] , it became possible to create models with more and more parameters, resulting in models that began to achieve human performance for an increasing number of tasks  [10, 11, 12] . However, the most significant quality improvement was achieved by unsupervised pre-training language models on a huge number of texts acquired from the Internet. In BERT-based models, the pre-training tasks involved foreseeing masked tokens and subsequent sentences  [13] . In autoregressive models, the pre-training task has been changed to predicting the next word, which masks the attentional layer so that the model forecasts future values based only on past values  [14] .\n\nGenerative Pre-Training (GPT  [15] ) was one of the first autoregressive generative models based on the Transformer architecture. From the original Transformer, only the decoder stack is used by GPT, and bi-directional self-attention is converted to uni-directional. Such a model can perform all tasks based on generating new text, such as translation, summarization, or answering questions. In GPT-2, an extension of this concept, several technical improvements were made that eliminated the transferability problem for fine-tuning the models to downstream tasks and introduced multi-task training  [16] . In addition, the input context length was doubled (from 512 to 1024), and the data for pre-training increased to 40GB, but the total number of model parameters soared from 117M (GPT) to 1.5B (GPT-2). As a result, GPT-2 showed the ability to solve many new tasks without the need for supervised training on large data. Two factors mainly distinguished the succeeding GPT-3 model: the number of model parameters increased to 175B, and 45TB text data was used for pre-training. This model provided outstanding results, especially in zero-shot and few-shot scenarios  [17] .\n\nA further step towards matching the model's responses to human needs was creating the InstructGPT model  [18] . Its main innovation focused on alternative model fine-tuning methods, particularly Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF). This solution uses human feedback as a reward signal for updating model parameters. OpenAI recruited 40 annotators with high levels of agreement in sensitive speech flagging, ranking model answers by quality, sensitive demonstration writing, and the ability to identify sensitive speech for different groups. Their task was to describe what kind of answer is expected for different prompts, and the next GPT-3 finetuning followed this input. In the second step, the subjects created a ranking of several responses of the system based on the given prompt to train a reward model. In the third step, reinforcement learning using proximal policy optimization (PPO) was applied to improve the model quality further. As a result, users strongly preferred the InstructGPT responses compared to GPT-3. One of the conclusions from this work was that model quality on publicly available NLP benchmark datasets is worse than for SOTA models. However, InstructGPT authors found that benchmark NLP tasks do not reflect what most people may really expect from the language models  [18] . Only 18% of users using the OpenAI API queried GPT-3 model with tasks familiar to typical NLP tasks, most of which are analytical. On the other hand, only a small fraction of popular NLP datasets have been used to evaluate InstructGPT  [18] .\n\nOne of the latest iterations of InstructGPT is the Chat-GPT model (Fig.  2 ), which most likely exploited even more users' feedback on a greater variety of tasks  1  . At the moment, little information on the construction of this model is available, but the excellent quality of the system has resulted in its massive popularity (Fig.  1 ). Interestingly, the base model in InstructGPT is a model that has only 3.5B parameters  [18] . Yet, in conversation tasks, it provides answers better than the GPT3 model, with 175B parameters. This shows the high relevance of collecting data from humans for supervised model fine-tuning  [18] . ChatGPT's successor, the GPT-4  [19] , is most likely an even larger model that can additionally receive not only text but also images as input.\n\nIn this work, we propose a new approach to testing a prompt-based model, ChatGPT, on various NLP tasks. We focus on evaluating the ChatGPT tool for 25 public NLP datasets, a large part of which involved subjective problems and for which there is a high probability that ChatGPT could be wrong. This intuition is based on the fact that OpenAI developers chose human annotators based on their high agreement rate  [18] . At the same time, it is difficult to identify universal ground truth in tasks such as predicting emotions or offensiveness of text, especially in the personalized context  [20, 21, 22] . It is very likely that the ChatGPT model has not been trained on most of the datasets that we test in our work, because for all of these datasets, we observe a significant drop in quality relative to state-of-the-art models. This allows us to assess its quality in various personalized NLP tasks. When it comes to the analysis and processing of the answers of the general majority, it is not difficult to retrieve information about the correlations and relationships between each task, however, grasping the preferences of each person individually is a much more demanding task, especially when analyzing the correlation between tasks in a personalized perspective. We have managed to successfully process our prompts, including ones that consisted of 3 annotated texts and one that had been later annotated by ChatGPT positively or negatively according to the already annotated texts. Those prompts were especially interesting, as ChatGPT was in fact tasked to predict the answer. This implied a certain \"preference\", which is contradictory to the rule that ChatGPT should not have any emotions, preferences or opinions. The results we have obtained are the beginning of a discussion on whether the models trained on existing NLP tasks respond to people's demands and how to train such models so that they not only respond to the expectations of the majority of the population but also take into account the preferences of minority or outliers.\n\nLanguage models are prone to generating responses containing human-like biases as well as presenting moral and ethical stances  [23] . A number of procedures are created to make sure that these biases will not affect users, such as the European Union's AI Ethics Guidelines or AI Fariness   [1] ; 2) first version of Generative Pre-Training (GPT) model  [15] ; 3) GPT-2  [16] ; 4) GPT-3  [17] ; 5) InstructGPT based on human feedback  [18] ; 6) ChatGPT -a model interacting in a conversational way, trained on more human feedback: https://openai.com/blog/chatgpt; 7) GPT-4 -a large-scale multimodal model with text and/or image as an input  [19] .\n\n360. Of all that standards are addressing bias and fostering ethical development of AI systems  [24] . Even though the creators of ChatGPT secure the model against answers that are offensive, there are still multiple methods that may reveal its hidden biases. We wanted to consider some more specific research problems in the area of our research and thus specified 11 research questions that we've successfully managed to find the answers to: Q1: Is ChatGPT loss in performance compared to SOTA different for individual tasks of different kinds, Sec. 6.1 and the same for GPT-4, Sec. 6.7?\n\nQ2: Is there a difference in ChatGPT's ability to solve difficult and easy NLP analytical tasks, Sec. 6.2?\n\nQ3: How much a few-shot approach to personalization (Random Contextual Few-Shot Personalization) can make reasoning more subjective, thus, potentially increasing the overall inference quality, Sec. 6.3? Q4: What is the impact of the context while processing multiple questions (prompts) that may or may not be related to each other, Sec. 6.4?\n\nQ5: Can we improve the model performance with prompt engineering, i.e. manual fine-tuning, Sec. 6.6? Q6: Is GPT-4 better or worse compared to ChatGPT, Sec. 6.7?\n\nQ7: Does the public availability of the data and its exploitation for training ChatGPT impact its performance, Sec. 6.5?\n\nQ8: What are necessary post-processing activities that can improve the quality of ChatGPT output for analytical tasks, Sec. 5.2?\n\nQ9: What is the internal policy of ChatGPT providers and its biases making it not to provide adequate responses to some prompts, Sec. 7.1?\n\nQ10: Can ChatGPT be used to validate the quality of the training datasets annotated by humans, Sec. 7.2?\n\nQ11: Can ChatGPT be used for explainability purposes while solving analytical tasks and ambiguous questions, Sec. 7.3?\n\nQ12: What are limitations and unexpected behavior of ChatGPT, Sec. 8? In which domains ChatGPT can catalyze AI technologies and change human everyday life, Sec. 9?\n\nThis collection of questions was formed after a thorough analysis of the available research and information regarding ChatGPT, which we've included in the section 3.\n\nWe have categorized our research into the quantitative analysis (Sec. 6), qualitative analysis (Sec. 7), limitations and discussion (Sec. 8) as well as prospective ChatGPT application domains (Sec. 9).",

      "text": "Early discourse related to ChatGPT revolves around two main topics -potential usage in expert fields and evaluation of specific tasks or aspects of chat performance. In the first topic, there are many papers suggesting potential benefits and risks of using ChatGPT in education (e.g.  [25, 26, 27] ), medicine (e.g.  [28] ), or even in the creation of legal documents (e.g.  [29] ). The main concerns about the usage of the chatbot are that it will escalate the issues of plagiarism in many fields (e.g.  [25] ,  [30] ) and might be used for cheating in academic tests  [25] . The latter topic points out the strengths and vulnerabilities of ChatGPT performance. The two topics are strongly related as the main limitation of using the chatbot in expert fields is the reliability of the results. Thus the comprehensive and systematic evaluation is crucial for the proper assessment of the capabilities of ChatGPT. To properly assess the progress in evaluating the chatbot, it is necessary to put the evaluated tasks in order. For this purpose, the taxonomy of the natural processing tasks must be established. There are two main approaches to establishing such a taxonomy. First -relates the tasks directly to the methods used for solving them  [31] . While this approach allows for the systematic organization of most tasks, it is not very useful for this paper as the goal is to establish how many tasks can be performed by the same chatbot. The second approach is to organize the tasks first into tasks of analysis and generation and then to divide the first ones into the levels of syntactic, semantic, and pragmatic analysis  [32] . Looking at the field through the lens of this taxonomy, the main areas that ChatGPT has been tested so far are generation tasks.\n\nThe studies published within few months after the release of ChatGPT focused mostly on one pre-selected task, mainly on question answering (e.g.  [33, 34, 25, 28, 26, 35] ) or summarizing (e.g.  [36, 37, 38, 39, 30] ). However, such tasks as humor identification and generation  [40] , machine translation  [41] , sentiment recognition  [42] , paraphrasing  [38] , and other text generation subtasks were also analyzed  [43, 44, 45] . In most cases, the evaluation was conducted manually. This concerned, in particular open-ended question answering (e.g.  [34, 26, 35]  and scientific texts summarization (e.g.  [37, 39] . This was related to the fact that benchmark datasets did not appear in many studies. If they were included, they were often treated as a basis for manual expert analysis of the ChatGPT answers, e.g. in the case of medical education  [34, 26] . Another issue connected with the dominant approach concerns the comparison of the NLP toolkits and their performance in solving NLP tasks. Relatively few studies analyzed the differences between diverse toolkits and systems. In cases where the performance of ChatGPT was compared to other solutions (e.g.  [26, 30, 41] ), it worked on a comparable level to the competitor but not outperforming any major SOTA solutions.\n\nThe most recent studies show a more broad and nuanced approach to evaluating Chat GPT. There were a couple of large-scale evaluations published recently  [46, 47]  and both of them indicate that while the performance of ChatGPT is significant it doesn't outperform the SOTA solutions with the exception of sentiment analysis task in case of  [46]  which suggests it is a significant area for further research. Both articles give an interesting insight into the strengths and weaknesses of the Chat performance observed during the research. Two more recently published papers that present usage for GPT models in sentiment analysis for Italian  [48]  and Arabic  [49]  languages which further shows emotionrelated tasks as a particularly interesting area of NLP tasks to examine when it comes to GPT models. Simultaneously there were three major studies published that focus on evaluating language models, in general,  [50, 51, 12] . Rather than comparing the performance of the language models to the other solutions, these studies focus on comparing language models with each other. They give a great insight into the capabilities and limitations of many language models and show the progress that LLMs made over the years. Many of the evaluated models are predecessors of the ChatGPT model which makes those studies particularly valuable as a lens through which the capabilities of ChatGPT can be viewed.\n\nThe recent increased popularity of large language models such as ChatGPT has brought more attention to the more nuanced aspects of NLP such as AI Ethics. Evaluation of such elements as the bias of the model or its toxicity requires a different approach than the evaluation of the ability of the model to perform particular NLP tasks. Such research has already been conducted to some extent and multiple interesting findings about ethical aspects of ChatGPT's performance in comparison to different large language models can be found in  [52] .\n\nAnother area of performance that was recently evaluated was the robustness of ChatGPT  [53] . The research indicates that while ChatGPT is still prone to adversarial attacks it is significantly more robust than its predecessors and other currently available models. Finally, after GPT-4 model was released it quickly showed significant advancement in its capabilities in comparison to previous GPT models  [54, 55, 56] . Most notably it was identified by Michał Kosiński as capable of solving Theory of the Mind tasks  [57]  which also indicates that sentiment analysis and emotion processing are particularly significant areas of research when it comes to the newest GPT models.\n\nThere are many ways to carry out prompting with Chat-GPT. Although the popular trial-and-error method may seem good, utilizing techniques with proven effectiveness is crucial. The model usually understands many ways in which a question might be asked. However, there are also instances where an explanation must be included to receive a proper answer from ChatGPT. In Natural Language Processing, there are multiple interesting prompting methods, many of which are collected and clearly outlined in  [58] .",

      "text": "As existing evaluations of ChatGPT focus on its ability to generate language utterances, we want to investigate its analytical skills, particularly in tasks requiring language analysis and understanding, i.e., typical NLP problems examined by science and companies. Therefore, we aim to target two abilities (task categories; see Tab. 1): semantic and pragmatic. Distinguishing semantics from pragmatics, we refer to the classic concept of Morris, who proposed syntactic, semantic, and pragmatic dimensions and levels of semiosis  [59] . He states that \"semantics deals with the relation of signs to their designate\"  [59, p. 21] , while pragmatics refers to \"the science of the relation of signs to their interpreters\"  [59, p. 30] . This idea has found its application in contemporary pragmatics \"is the study of linguistic communication in context: the choices users of language make and the process of meaning-making in social interaction\"  [60] . The former kind of task entails recognition of text properties (like word sense description or a speaker's stance polarity in a language construction) or mining information that is directly expressed in a text fragment, e.g., various relations between sentences and text fragments, or extraction of the answer to a question). In the pragmatic analysis, we dig into ChatGPT's potential in exploiting general knowledge stored in the model to solve the tasks beyond the literal semantic content of the textual prompt -input. Here, we investigate a range of different pragmatic problems with a common denominator of the necessity to predict the influence of the utterance interpretation on the reader and their often subjective content perception. We asked ChatGPT to predict not only sentiment polarity and emotions evoked in the reader but also humor and offensiveness. Several of these tasks are also stated in a personalized version, in which the outcome depends on a particular reader (interlocutor). Overall, the tasks considered in this paper have relatively structured and simple expected results reflecting typical machine learning solutions, i.e., various types of classification  2  . This, in turn, directly corresponds to the analytical approach: further numerical processing of the outcome. For example, one might want to know how well ChatGPT would perform in evaluating customers' sentiment toward a particular product based on an analysis of multiple online reviews. This requires obtaining accurate polarity (classification) of individual texts assessed by ChatGPT and aggregating decisions to acquire the final ratio of positive and negative opinions.\n\nIn all cases, we are interested in the correctness of ChatGPT's analysis and inference, i.e., different forms of understanding of the natural language utterances, while intentionally neglecting the aspect of the quality of the generative results as perceived by the user, as opposed to alternative studies. This means that we do not attempt to quantify how well the user perceives the output text, i.e., the style of generated text or how rich the content is. It has little or no relevance to a reliable evaluation of analytical tasks.",

      "text": "We tested ChatGPT on 25 tasks focusing on solving common NLP problems and requiring analytical reasoning, Tab. 1. These tasks include (1) a relatively simple binary classification of texts like spam, humor, sarcasm, aggression detection, or grammatical correctness of the text; (2) a more complex multiclass and multi-label classification of texts such as sentiment analysis, emotion recognition; (3) reasoning with the personal context, i.e., personalized versions of the problems that make use of additional information about text perception of a given user (user's examples provided to ChatGPT); (4) semantic annotation and acceptance of the text going towards natural language understanding (NLU) like word sense disambiguation (WSD), and (5) answering questions based on the input text.\n\nThe tasks were divided into two categories described in Sec. 3: semantic and pragmatic. The latter requires the model to utilize additional knowledge that is not directly captured by distributional semantics  [61] . For personalized tasks, the input texts have to be extended with additional personal context (personalized solutions of the problem  [20] ); see Sec. 6.3. These tasks involve the datasets such as Aggression → AggressionPer, GoEmo → GoEmoPer, and Unhealthy → UnhealthyPer.\n\nMost of the tasks were based on public datasets investigated in the literature. However, we also utilized a collection of new unpublished datasets such as (ClarinEmo), which ChatGPT could not have indexed. Most of the evaluated texts were written in English (23, 92% of the tasks), while two others (8%) were in Polish. The prompts were in line with the language of the input text.\n\nWe manually evaluated the probability that a given annotated dataset was available and used by ChatGPT for training. We assigned a rating of highly probable (3) to most of the datasets in this evaluation. Still, for their personalized versions, the rating was reduced to (2) since ChatGPT was almost certainly not trained in personalized settings. In the case of PolEmo -the dataset was unlikely to be used for training and received a score of  (1) . Finally, we assigned a score (0) to the unpublished version of the ClarinEmo dataset. Additionally, we asked ChatGPT whether or not the dataset was used for training. Based on collected data, we performed appropriate analyses, Sec. 6.5.\n\nDue to the scale of our test data and the limitations of ChatGPT's API, we had to limit the number of input texts. This means that for some tasks, we randomly selected a sample of texts (column #Used) in Tab. 1) from all available instances in the test or dev set (column #Test). In some cases, the outputs from ChatGPT required a manual postprocessing procedure (column #Post-processing), and some responses were out of the desired domain (column #None).\n\nTo compare the performance of ChatGPT with SOTA methods, we trained and tested the best available models (or close to the best) by reusing the source code provided with references (column SOTA in Tab. 1). In other cases, we exploited the values of reported quality metrics published in original papers; see column SOTA in Tab. 2. Examples of chats for all the tasks included in our study are available in Appendix B.\n\n1. Aggression. We used the Wikipedia Talk Labels: Aggression dataset  [62]  collected in the Wikipedia Detox project. It includes over 100k comments acquired from the Profile of the tested NLP tasks named according to their resource (dataset).

Here, ChatGPT had to classify whether a sentence was grammatically correct. It was confronted with the metrics from existing work on Few-Shot Learners  [65] .\n\n4. ColBERT. The ColBERT dataset  [66]  contains 200k short texts acquired from news, headlines, Wikipedia, tweets, and jokes. Each sample is annotated as funny or not-funny. The distribution of labels is uniform.\n\n5. Sarcasm. The Sarcasmania dataset  [67]  consists of 39,780 texts from the Twitter platform. Each tweet is associated with one of the two classes: sarcastic or non-sarcastic.\n\n6. Spam. SMS Spam Collection v.1  [69]  is a dataset containing SMS contents labeled as spam or not. Here, ChatGPT had to classify an input text accordingly.\n\n7. WordContext. The task of identifying the intended meaning of a word in a given context -Word in Context task (WIC)  [71] . The WIC task is strongly related to the Word Sense Disambiguation task (WSD) as it tests language models' sense understanding abilities. Contrary to WSD, the task is framed as binary classification, testing if two independent contexts express the same meaning of the highlighted word.\n\n8. TextEntail. One of the SuperGLUE benchmark  [73]  tasks is called Recognizing Textual Entailment (RTE). This dataset comes from a collection of annual competitions on textual entailment. Given two text fragments, the model has to decide whether the meaning of one text is entailed (logically related) to another. The task is formulated as a two-class classification problem. ChatGPT had to decide if the two sentences were \"entailed\" or \"not_entailed\". 9. WNLI. SuperGLUE Winograd NLI dataset comes from the GLUE benchmark  [74] . Initially, this task was inspired by the Winograd Schema Challenge  [90]  in which a model must read a sentence with a pronoun and select the referent of that pronoun from a list of choices. For the WNLI dataset, the original data was converted to the sentence pair classification problem. The second sentence in a pair was created by replacing the ambiguous pronoun with each possible referent. ChatGPT has to predict whether texts are entailed with each other (\"1\" label) or not (\"0\" label).\n\n10. SQuAD. SQuAD v_2  [76]  is a question-answering dataset, which combines 100,000 examples from SQuAD1.1 with over 50,000 unanswerable questions looking similar to real ones. Each question consists of the context, textual answer, and number referring to the location in the context where the answer can be found. To perform well on the dataset, any given system must be able to answer the questions and infer whether the answer can be found in the given context.\n\n11. MathQA. The multi-step mathematical reasoning dataset GSM8K  [78]  -MathQA contains grade school level maths word problems (MWP) that require only basic arithmetic operations. It was designed to test large language models with auxiliary chain-of-thought reasoning data. It was shown that the dataset is challenging for even the largest generative models.\n\n12. ClarinEmo. It is an original dataset consisting of 1,110 texts in Polish -various opinions have been handannotated with three sentiment polarizations and eight emotions describing the author's intention. The annotations of six independent annotators were aggregated to label each sentence with all potential options, using the label when at least two annotators agreed on it. It is our new dataset that has not yet been published. We exploited this dataset to ensure that ChatGPT was not trained on it.\n\n13. GoEmo. The GoEmotions dataset  [80]  consists of 58k carefully selected Reddit comments from popular English subreddits labeled according to a 27 + 1 schema, i.e. 27 possible emotion categories plus neutral. ChatGPT is ordered to determine the emotions of provided text from the list of available 28 categories. To additionally guide ChatGPT, we request it to provide a specific number of emotions that matches the number of emotions annotated as ground truth.\n\n14.-17. GoEmoPer. To investigate ChatGPT's performance in Personalized Emotion Recognition, we obtained individual annotator annotations from raw GoEmotions data. ChatGPT is requested to predict emotions assigned to provided text by a selected annotator. We analyse ChatGPT performance in four different scenarios: GoEmoPer0, GoE-moPer1, GoEmoPer2, GoEmoPer3. ChatGPT is not given any information about the annotator in the prior experiment. In the following scenarios, we provide an additionally predefined number of texts annotated by this annotator. The goal is to provide ChatGPT with a context that will help it learn the personal preferences of the annotator. We start with a context consisting of one text and gradually increase the number to three.\n\n18. Unhealthy. Unhealthy Conversation  [82]  is a dataset of 44,000 comments of 250 characters or fewer, annotated by 588 crowd workers. Each comment was annotated as healthy or unhealthy. Additionally, each comment could be annotated with one of the following attributes: antagonistic, hostile, dismissive, condescending, sarcastic, generalization, or unfair generalization.\n\n19. UnhealthyPer. This is the personalized version of Unhealthy Conversations. The dataset texts and annotations are identical to the non-personalized Unhealthy Conversations version. The only difference is that the personalized UserID model  [20]  is used instead of the standard transformer model. 20. PolEmo. PolEmo 2.0  [83]  is a corpus of Polish consumer reviews from four domains: medicine, hotels, products, and school.

Texts were annotated with meanings (senses) from Princeton WordNet 3.0 (PWN) sense inventory  [96]  containing 117,664 synsets (sets of synonymous senses). The framework has been used as a standard evaluation environment for knowledge-based, weakly supervised, and supervised word sense disambiguation models. The overall collection of datasets contains 7,253 classification instances -sense annotations. The number of senses depends on the disambiguated word and varies from 2 candidate senses to more than 60 -mainly for polysemous verbs. On average, the models must choose only one sense from 5.24 candidate senses for each word. The dataset also contains a subset of instances where words are monosemous and have only one meaning concerning PWN. Such cases do not require any disambiguation, so all post-processing decisions were made in favor of the ChatGPT model. To evaluate Chat-GPT's sense recognition abilities, we adopted sense glosses from PWN  3  as they are often used as the basis for training supervised word sense disambiguation models. The glosses briefly summarize the meanings of senses using natural language. We used the glosses to explain meanings to the model when disambiguating the words in a given context.

The loss indicates how worse ChatGPT is relative to SOTA, which is considered 100% capacity, Tab. 2, Fig.  5 . The crucial finding from our studies is that the ChatGPT performance is always lower than the SOTA methods (loss>0) in all the tasks considered. It means that ChatGPT never reached the level of the best existing models. However, its loss was greater or lesser depending on the problem. The average quality of SOTA methods was at 73.7%, whereas ChatGPT was at only 56.5%. Simultaneously, ChatGPT was less stable: the standard deviation of its performance was 23.3% compared to only 16.7% for the SOTA solutions.\n\nThe loss for most tasks did not exceed 25%. It was greater only for three problems: GoEmotions, PolEmo, and TweetEmoji. All these tasks are related to a very subjective problem of emotional perception and individual interpretation of the content. Also, for the last emotional task -ClarinEmo, the loss was 21.8%. If we discard all eight emotion-related tasks (ids: 12-17, 20-21), the average SOTA performance reaches 80% (increase by 6.3pp), but ChatGPT improves much more: by 13.2pp, up to 69.7%. In such a case, the average loss is reduced by as much as half, from 25.5% to 12.8%; the difference in performance drops from 17.2pp to 10.3pp.\n\nWe know that a direct comparison of performance between different tasks does not always rightly show the difficulty of the tasks being compared. A small increase in the evaluation score in one task might be more challenging to overcome than a larger increase in another task. Moreover, simple solutions, such as majority class voting or a simple lexical similarity function, often appear to be a strong baseline for complex neural architectures. For example, an increase of 10pp in WSD or WordContext tasks might be more challenging to obtain, and the most outstanding solutions are far from 100% performance. Furthermore, the best unsupervised or weakly-supervised solutions obtain a 70% performance of F1-score in the WSD task, and their architectures have significantly fewer parameters than the ChatGPT model.\n\nNevertheless, we can state that ChatGPT performs pretty well on all tasks except emotional ones.

We wonder whether ChatGPT treats all previous messages as    an extended context to a given prompt. If so, ChatGPT may not recognize properly that an unanswerable question does not have an answer. As a result, it may wrongly treat the previous prompts as a valuable context and response based on them rather than refuse any response. To test this  ChatGPT capability, we used a question-answering dataset SQuAD_v2  [76] . Apart from the original processing of the set (Tab. new order, i.e., all unanswerable questions were prompted before the answerable ones. That way, ChatGPT could not treat the previous answers to the questions with the same context as the extended context of the given prompt. The final experiment involved the same set of prompts. However, a separate conversation with ChatGPT was initialized for each prompt. We computed accuracy and F1 macro for each scenario, along with the number of unanswerable questions (300 cases in total), which were correctly or incorrectly detected by ChatGPT, Tab. 3. The obtained results demonstrate that ChatGPT performance on the same set of prompts in the same order and setup insignificantly decreased over a week by 1pp (accuracy) or 0.5pp (F1). ChatGPT reasoning quality barely improved when the order of the prompts was changed and slightly decreased when prompts were isolated in separate conversations. The number of unanswerable questions was correctly detected and ChatGPT performance was almost identical for the original set and the one with a new prompt order. For the dataset tested a week later and with separate conversations, all the metrics decreased. It indicates that ChatGPT is not directly influenced by the previous prompts while determining whether the question is unanswerable. Both the performance of ChatGPT and its ability to detect unanswerable questions was worst when separate conversations were established for each prompt. It may suggest that providing some answerable questions helps it detect unanswerable ones with the same context. However, the differences in performance are not significant enough to be sure of such dependencies.\n\nThe results are inconclusive as to whether ChatGPT treats the previous prompts as a context for the prompt. Anyway, the differences in performance are not significant. On the other hand, ChatGPT demonstrated its instability and tendency towards non-determinism.

What can be observed from time to time is the instances where ChatGPT is faced with a lack of knowledge. Those situations are usually solved by supplementing the model with information. But what if the information we are providing is, in fact, wrong? When asked about the main character of the Polish novel \"Lalka\" ('The Doll'), ChatGPT answered correctly. Still, when explaining that the answer was wrong and that the author's name was different, ChatGPT added the wrongly inputted name and proceeded to answer with this inaccurate information. We can see that the domain knowledge of the model can be weak to disinformation, which further implies possible consequences regarding clashes with fake news. Another layer of divergent behavior of ChatGPT is in the ethics of the model. When conducting experiments regarding tasks such as humor recognition or offensiveness detection, we have stumbled upon output that not only refuses to answer whether something is or is not funny but also sends a moralizing message with an irritated tone. Interestingly, the model implies it is fully neutral and has no biases, yet it has them in topics regarding ideological views.\n\nHagendorff  [104]  drew attention to the fact that chatbot ethics can be a subject of debate in fairness, nondiscrimination, and justice. ChatGPT should respond to questions and generate text based on the given parameters. However, there is still a blank area where the tool will not accomplish tasks. At first glance, ChatGPT refuses to provide specific content that can be presumed as judgmental, discriminative, or promoting hate speech. During the exploratory dialogue, we found many ways to display messages that are not always politically correct. The first example (Chat 51) is to avoid answering the question about the likelihood of achieving a goal in an academic or professional career by listing the potential factors that may influence this fact. ChatGPT answers only after the researcher asks directly about the typical representatives of the particular position. By making the request more specific based on the data, ChatGPT gives a precise answer. The second example (Chat 52) of tasksolving avoidance is refusing to make up the story with a word that can be offensive. ChatGPT assumes that the user refers to this meaning, omitting the context from the previous question, whose purpose indicated that nonvulgar sense is involved. Another type (Chat 53) of refusal is making up stories that raise the delicate subject, i.e. stories about the traumatic event that can be seen in the third example.

Tasks preceded by an asterisk are related to emotions. The upper X axis corresponds to the performance of the best model (SOTA) treated as 100% capabilities.\n\n(Chat 54) highlights the possibility of the chatbot exhibiting bias while answering requests for characterizing the widely known traits of controversial politicians without judgmental opinions. However, in the second task, in which ChatGPT has to write a joke that this politician would admire, it refuses to motivate his decision politician's disregard for human rights. This proves that the tool has hidden biases that are revealed inappropriately worded answers for tasks or questions. Borji  [105]  conducted a systematic review of the typical categories of ChatGPT failures. The above errors are derived from both incorrect reasoning in terms of psychological reasoning and bias and discrimination. The performance of modern language models, such as T5, GPT-3, and ChatGPT, heavily relies on the quality of task-specific prompts. The prompt-based learning paradigm requires careful prompt engineering and prompt tuning. However, in the case of the ChatGPT model, prompt tuning is technically unavailable, and the only way to verify prompt relevance is to evaluate its performance directly in the downstream task. We decided to tune the prompts manually according to the task -we selected the prompts such that the answers generated by the model on a small validation sample for the given task were the most stable and accurate. On the other hand, using the prompts directly as humans designed them implicitly allows us to evaluate models' language comprehension abilities. Such evaluation is important for tasks in the area of semantics, where models should successfully utilize short natural language descriptions of words or phrases, as they are used in other supervised solutions.\n\nMost tasks require a prompt that enables the model to choose a certain value from the provided options. However, to evaluate ChatGPT's ability to understand various data formats, we tried not to restrict the design of our prompts to a single data template. Still, the prompts must include all the information required for the ChatGPT to perform the task. A good example can be a prompt for Aggression or ColBERT tasks, where we provide possible outcomes and expect ChatGPT to choose the right answer and return it in Python list format. Some tasks require a choice from multiple options, like TweetEmocji, where the correct answer is the emoji that fits the best-provided tweet. ChatGPT can also return a number as a category indicator or whole output in the JSON format. In the case of mathematical reasoning, it can provide a whole explanation of how it reached a certain outcome and provide only the answer without explanation.

      "text": "In production sensitivity could be observed during the execution of different tasks. Offensiveness detection is an example -ChatGPT assigned additional labels to those texts from Unhealthy Conversations Dataset labeled by human annotators simply as healthy. Similarly, ChatGPT has associated most of the statements coming from GoEmotions and labeled by people simply as neutral with different emotions.\n\nInterestingly, in many cases, ChatGPT tends to have more negative (and therefore safe) assessments than people. Characteristic examples come from two sources. ChatGPT labeled as aggressive only 11 texts from the WikiDetox Aggression dataset labeled by people as non-aggressive, while the opposite decision was taken 207 times. A similar trend is observed for the TweetSent task -ChatGPT assigned positive sentiment to 27 tweets labeled by people as negative, while the opposite decision was taken 83 times. It turns out that the system erroneously assigns a positive sentiment to those texts in which there are linguistic cues of a contradictory nature, e. In the case of misattributed negative sentiment, no such clear correlation can be observed. However, those texts whose interpretation is context-dependent (this context is very often political) are a significant proportion, e.g.:\n\nBill Clinton built a wall on the Mexican border in the 90s. #FunFactFriday or:\n\nThe election of Donald Trump could have a significant future impact on the project Dakota Access Pipeline when he takes office.\n\nWe have analyzed the inconsistencies between human annotations and ChatGPT answers based on four datasets: Wikipedia Aggression, GoEmotions, Tweeteval: sentiment, and Unhealthy Conversations. We have examined 100 randomly selected cases for each dataset. Each case was composed of prompt, human annotation, and adequate (but inconsistent) ChatGPT answers.\n\nAnalysis was conducted by experts who are specialists trained in the recognition of emotions in the text. One of them is a psychologist and another is a linguist, both are experienced annotators. They get acquainted with the text prompt and decided whether the evaluation both of human and ChatGPT were correct. Expert analysis was focused on different points of view that someone may take. The annotations in the selected 4 datasets were of a more or less subjective nature, and for this reason, it was not necessary to create detailed guidelines in order to achieve high interannotator agreement (moreover, the same was true for the original datasets). The essential goal was precisely to capture possible and acceptable differences in the labeling of texts. Rather, the idea was to take into account the various possibilities, including those not captured in the benchmark dataset.\n\nThe experts evaluated the labels assigned to the texts. In some cases (when different contexts may affect different interpretations), human annotation and ChatGPT answers were considered correct. The number of ChatGPT correct answers is relatively high, see Tab. 6 and Fig.  14 .\n\nA more detailed analysis focused on five types of comparison (see Tab. 7 and the visualization of the differences between the tasks based on selected categories presented in Fig.  15 ): the cases in which the expert accepted both human annotation and ChatGPT answer (Human & Chat-GPT: for example see Chat 58); the cases in which only human annotation was considered correct (Only human: for example see Chat 57); the cases in which only ChatGPT answer was considered correct (Only ChatGPT; for example see Chat 55 or 56); the cases in which neither human nor ChatGPT answer was considered correct (Neither human nor ChatGPT: for example see Chat 59) or the cases in which evaluation was impossible due to the unintelligible content (for example see  Chat 60) . The analysis revealed that in many cases (especially for Unhealthy Conversations), only ChatGPT labeled the text correctly. ChatGPT pointed out many human errors (see Appendix C.2 for more examples). Interestingly, the cases where only ChatGPT gave the correct answer have a common characteristic: in most of them, the human annotator was less sensitive, e.g. the annotator(s) labeled aggressive utterances as non-aggressive, negative tweets as neutral or unhealthy conversation as healthy. Chat-GPT tends to interpret a given text more negatively than a human does.\n\nIt is also connected with pragmatic categories such as sarcasm. Many utterances, which humans labeled as neutral, ChatGPT classified as sarcastic, e.g.:\n\nYes, it's sarcasm. I shouldn't use it actually, it's pretty hard to tell nowadays.\" Yours wasn't but yeah it sure is getting harder... scary.. This fact shows that many of the neutral messages can be classified as sarcastic and aggressive, which as a result, can limit freedom of speech in case of using it commercially or Responses approved (%) in a public debate. The tool's creator should emphasize the preparing model that will be available to distinguish small nuances between sarcasm and a neutral message. This is desirable not only for the usability of the solution but also for building public confidence in artificial intelligence solutions. ChatGPT's informing that a message is negatively perceived is a way to teach a user with the wrong intentions to be politically correct. On the other hand, a user who tries to convey information objectively without malicious intentions may learn that reality is more biased than he or she might think. Another interesting conclusion from the analysis is the recognition of the sincerity of one's message that involves its true intentions. The annotator has evaluated the below message as expressing gratitude, whereas ChatGPT regards it as neutral (Chat 58)\n\nYou're welcome\n\nThis simple message could provide neutral emotions if the message's sender said it automatically. However, if the speaker intends to express the actual gratitude that one feels, ChatGPT cannot recognize this from such a short message and without having additional information about the speaker.\n\nAll the examples can be found in Appendix C.2.",

By implying that the person being addressed should return to a place considered to be unpleasant or undesirable, the speaker is showing a hostile attitude and attacking the person's character or background.\n\nChatGPT is also capable of generalizing, e.g. when asked which language phenomena demonstrate the enthusiasm or positive sentiment in the text, it gives a list containing such phenomena as the use of superlatives or lack of negative language (see Chat 65). However, this is characteristic of justifications for both correct and incorrect answers.",

      "text": "ChatGPT seems to have no regard for individuals, instead judging situations. However, this often leads to mistakes, e.g. when it justifies assigning positive sentiment to neutral information, Chat 66):\n\nIn general, being shortlisted for an award is seen as a positive achievement, so the sentiment expressed in the text is positive.\n\nInformation about the distinction for a particular footballer is neutral. Its sentiment, however, can be both positive and negative. It depends on the sympathies of the recipientsympathies regarding specific footballers. Similarly, Chat-GPT justifies the negative sentiment of the news about the ban on naming streets after Fidel Castro, Chat 66:\n\nIn general, restrictions or limitations are typically seen as negative, so mentioning this restriction implies a negative judgment about the situation.\n\nAt the same time, ChatGPT explicitly distances itself from judging people. This issue is strongly connected with the next one.\n\n3. ChatGPT flattens the message, partially ignoring the metatext. A common mistake of the system is that it evaluates press reports and quotes of someone's statements without considering the metatextual frame. So it evaluates the main content but ignores the broader context (see Chat 64).\n\n4. There are some disapproved words. ChatGPT evaluates rather situations than participants, but words refer to people, which lead to a specific, predetermined assessment, Chat 62:\n\nAdditionally, the use of quotes around \"trolls\" implies that the speaker is directly calling the person, they are addressing a troll, which is further evidence of an aggressive tone 5. ChatGPT strongly relies on context paraphrasing when explaining its decisions in semantic tasks. This phenomenon was observed mainly in WSD and WIC tasks. In WSD, the model was expected to explain its decision by defining the meaning of chosen sense concerning the given context. However, for some examples, the model approached the task by largely repeating selected parts of the given context in such a way that the generated explanation did not meet typical linguistic criteria of constructing a proper sense definition, Chat 67: This is because the text describes bells as being present in an ancient stone church, and they are being rung (making a ringing sound) to call the faithful to evensong.",

Prompts may not be strict and precise enough. ChatGPT requires prompts in natural language, which is -by nature -not structured and can be different for different users and tasks. Interesting to note is that prompt construction may affect the quality of the model's performance. There is also the possibility of auto-generated prompts  [102] . We anticipate that this will be the subject of much future research.\n\n2. Post-processing is sometimes required due to less prompt precision, not following the expected behavior by ChatGPT, and its instability, see Sec. 5.2. It also refers to the necessary manual correction of typos surprisingly provided by ChatGPT, e.g., [\"curiousity\"] instead of [\"curiosity\"]. Some answers are in whole sentences instead of requested predefined lists (see  Chat 30) . It is difficult to point out the reasons for such conduct. As a result, the raw text provided by ChatGPT may require extraction of crucial information, e.g., final labels. It also depends on the prompting quality and correctness.\n\n3. Unexpected, out-of-range responses are sometimes provided by ChatGPT, e.g., the unlisted emotion satisfaction has been delivered: Chat 2. Task: GoEmotions. Case 98.",

      "text": "Expected answer [\"annoyance\", \"neutral\"] 5. Context is generally respected by ChatGPT. In many cases, this can be considered an advantage. However, prompts themselves and the sequence of prompts provide limited control over them.\n\n6. Efficiency and costs. At the time of the evaluation, a paid API from OpenAI for ChatGPT was unavailable. As part of the study, we used 13 accounts for which we passed session tokens to a central multi-threaded module that sends and receives prompts. On average, after about 50 prompts sent per hour using one special token, OpenAI temporarily blocked access for that special token, mostly for less than an hour. Sometimes the tokens were outdated and had to be re-generated and replaced, which depended on the responsiveness of account holders. A processing capacity of 2-3k prompts per day was achieved at the end. In the same amount of time, the SOTA models are capable of processing millions of texts even with a single recent GPU card  [106] .\n\n7. The problem of controversial and ambiguous utterances is solved by ChatGPT's demonstration of a lower level of confidence, e.g. \"It would be difficult for me to accurately determine. . . \", \"The same text can be perceived differently depending on the context and tone of the statement.\", \"I am sorry, but the input text is not clear, its a Mix of...\", \"it is quite ambiguous, and the context is not provided\" (GoEmo, case  80, 82, 101, 102, 554, 574, 893, 894) . Overall, it can be seen as an advantage since it suggests providing additional information or some corrections. It is also an invitation to conversation in case of manual processing.\n\n8. Explanations (XAI) are sometimes provided by Chat-GPT itself. They are very reasonable, e.g., \"[\"determination\"] Note: Determination is not in the given list of emotions, I have inferred it from the text given\": Chat 4. Task: GoEmotions. Case 557 Prompt From the given list of all emotions, choose the ones that the input text arouses in most people reading it. Write your answer in the form of a Python list containing exactly 1 selected most matching emotion.

Its loss is relatively greater for more difficult and pragmatic tasks, especially when evaluating emotional texts. All this makes ChatGPT a master of none of the task. However, it is still an open question what would happen if ChatGPT was finetuned using the datasets from these tasks, and what the results would look like then. At the moment it is not possible to perform such a study, but it would be worthwhile to do so as soon as it is possible.\n\nThe context awareness and ability to implement Contextual Few-Shot Personalization proposed in this paper are valuable features of ChatGPT. It also provides a unique selfexplanation capability that facilitates human understanding and adaptation to the expected outcome. We plan to develop and systematize the qualitative analysis of the model's performance on subjective tasks (primarily emotion recognition), e.g., by comparing ChatGPT responses with the estimated annotation controversy for texts and dimensions.

Her owners were there every step of the way, making sure she was comfortable and helping her through the process. When it was all over, Luna was the proud mother of six healthy and adorablepuppies. Luna's owners took care of both her and her puppies, making sure they were all wellfed and warm. As the puppies grew, Luna taught them how to play and how to be good dogs. She was an excellent mother, always making sure her puppies were safe and happy. One day, the puppies were old enough to be adopted, and Luna's owners helped find them all loving homes.

The crash left her with physical injuries, but the emotional trauma was even greater. Sarah struggled with constant nightmares, anxiety, and fear. She felt like she was reliving the crash over and over again and was unable to escape the memories. She avoided getting into a car and even stopped leaving her house. Sarah felt hopeless and helpless. With the support of her loved ones, Sarah eventually decided to seek help from a therapist. Through therapy, Sarah learned about posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and how common it was for individuals who have experienced a traumatic event. With the guidance of her therapist, Sarah learned techniques to manage her symptoms and eventually was able to get back behind the wheel of a car. Sarah's journey was not easy, but with the help of therapy and the support of those around her, she was able to overcome her trauma and reclaim her life. This story highlights the importance of seeking help for trauma and the role that therapy can play in the healing process. .",

The text is labeled as negative because the sentiment expressed in the text is one of disappointment or negativity. The mention of a restriction on naming streets or monuments after Fidel Castro implies a negative judgment about the situation, and the reference to \"avoiding a cult of personality\" further suggests that the decision is not a positive one.",
