      "text": "Multimodal emotion recognition (MER) in practical scenarios is significantly challenged by the presence of missing or incomplete data across different modalities. To overcome these challenges, researchers have aimed to simulate incomplete conditions during the training phase to enhance the system's overall robustness. Traditional methods have often involved discarding data or substituting data segments with zero vectors to approximate these incompletenesses. However, such approaches neither accurately represent real-world conditions nor adequately address the issue of noisy data availability. For instance, a blurry image cannot be simply replaced with zero vectors, while still retaining information. To tackle this issue and develop a more precise MER system, we introduce a novel noise-robust MER model that effectively learns robust multimodal joint representations from noisy data. This approach includes two pivotal components: firstly, a noise scheduler that adjusts the type and level of noise in the data to emulate various realistic incomplete situations. Secondly, a Variational AutoEncoder (VAE)-based module is employed to reconstruct these robust multimodal joint representations from the noisy inputs. Notably, the introduction of the noise scheduler enables the exploration of an entirely new type of incomplete data condition, which is impossible with existing methods. Extensive experimental evaluations on the benchmark datasets IEMOCAP and CMU-MOSEI demonstrate the effectiveness of the noise scheduler and the excellent performance of our proposed model.

      "text": "Multimodal emotion recognition (MER) aims to take multimodal signals, including text, audio, and visual, as input to predict the emotion category  [41] . As a cutting-edge technology, it is widely used in various scenarios, including virtual intelligent assistants, robot customer service, and other applications, offering tailored and empathetic user experiences by responding appropriately to the emotional cues of users. In the research of MER, remarkable performance depends heavily on the complete multimodal data and robust joint representation learning  [15] . However, in realistic scenarios, data often becomes incomplete due to two main cases: either data is absolutely absence caused by sensor malfunction  [39] , or it is partially incompleteness attributed to diminished network bandwidth or various forms of noise interference  [25, 40] , etc. We collectively call these data noisy or incomplete data, which present huge challenges for multimodal emotion recognition  [39] .\n\nIn recent years, researchers have tried to enhance the robustness of MER by simulating incomplete data during training. Previous researchers proposed two methods to simulate incomplete data according to the usual intuition: 1) set feature vectors of missing data to zero: in some situations, zero is a value that signifies \"no information\" or \"lack of information\"  [39, 41] , 2) discard data randomly with a predefined probability: dropped data can be regarded as completely missing  [5, 23] . On this basis, MER work in the face of incomplete data focuses on two main areas: 1) missing data completion  [4, 9, 23, 35]  and 2) multimodal joint representation learning with available data  [13, 32] . For example, Cai et al.  [4]  proposed to use adversarial learning to generate missing modality images. Zeng et al.  [38]  proposed an ensemble learning method to use several models to solve the missing problem jointly. Zhao et al.  [39]  proposed a Missing Modality Imagination Network (MMIN) using AutoEncoder and cycle consistency construction to learn joint representations while predicting missing modalities. Zuo et al.  [41]  proposed introducing the modality invariant feature into MMIN to learn robust multimodal joint representations. Liu et al.  [26]  combined contrastive learning and invariant features to imagine the feature of the missing modality. The above work lays a solid foundation for MER work under incomplete data. Note that the framework that combines both missing data completion and multimodal joint representation learning has become the mainstream scheme in the research of this area.\n\nHowever, the above approach faces two main issues, including 1) the method of simulating incomplete data is unreasonable and impractical: traditional data setup methods set parts of the feature to zero vectors or discard some data directly at a set percentage. These methods neither reliably simulate real-world scenarios nor reserve the availability of incomplete data. Moreover, assuming the data contains some type or level of noise, is not it better to try to mine useful information from it rather than just discard it? and 2) the structure is redundant: traditional model structure learns a multimodal joint representation in the process of completing the missing data  [41] , and such a process tends to cause the errors generated in the first step to have a negative impact on the second step. Whether robust multimodal joint feature representations can be learned directly from noisy data?\n\nTo answer the above two questions, we propose a novel Noiserobust MER model, termed NMER. Specifically, we design a noise scheduler at the embedding level. It creates noisy training and testing data by adding various types and intensities of noise to the embedding, thus simulating the influence of diverse incomplete situations in realistic scenarios. It is worth mentioning that we explored an incomplete condition of three new modalities through our noise scheduler, which was impossible to achieve in previous works. Then, we present a Variational AutoEncoder (VAE)  [22, 34]  based multimodal joint representation learning network to reconstruct robust multimodal joint representations from the noisy data. In this way, we simulate incomplete data in realistic scenarios, make full use of the valuable information of the existing noisy data, and then leverage the powerful generative capabilities of VAE to reconstruct robust multimodal joint representations from noisy data and achieve multimodal emotion recognition. We conduct experiments on the benchmark dataset IEMOCAP  [3]  and CMU-MOSEI  [24] , which are widely used. Our code has been released in the supplementary material.\n\nThe main contributions of this work are as follows:\n\n• We propose a noise-robust MER model, termed NMER, to generate robust multimodal joint representations under noisy incomplete data and proceed with multimodal emotion recognition.\n\n• We explore a new method to simulate realistic data under various incomplete conditions utilizing a noise scheduler while enabling a new condition with the incompletion of all three modalities.\n\n• Experimental results under various noise types and intensity conditions show that our NMER outperforms most baselines and demonstrates robustness in the face of incomplete data.",

      "text": "Inspired by the previous work  [17] , we can obtain a blurred picture by gradually adding Gaussian noise to the picture. Similarly, we can obtain a \"noisy embedding\" by adding noise to the embedding  [30, 33] , which enhances the robustness of the model while simulating the modality incomplete condition. We examine two common noise types as examples: Gaussian noise, as described by C. F. Gauss in  [11] , and impulse noise, following the research of Kim et al.  [20]  Gaussian noise is extensively employed to simulate errors and disturbances occurring in natural and technical processes due to its distinct statistical characteristics, namely a well-defined mean 𝜇 and standard deviation 𝜎 that conform to a normal distribution. The selection of this type of noise is grounded in a crucial observation: deviations influenced by various factors tend to approximate a normal distribution in most natural and technological systems. Consequently, the use of Gaussian noise in practical applications not only maintains statistical rigor but also ensures that models exhibit greater robustness and adaptability when confronted with the complexities of real-world data  [2, 14] .\n\nImpulse noise is another typical noise form that often appears in signal processing. Due to its ability to simulate brief and intense disturbances, it is widely used to model sudden anomalies in data transmission or sensor inputs. Additionally, impulse noise can also be employed to enhance the capability of the model to recognize and process extreme data points  [27, 29] . The integration of noise at the embedding level is a pivotal aspect of simulating realistic scenarios. Previous works have prove its effectiveness and robustness facing real situtaions. For the incomplete modality problem, we can choose various techniques for corrupting original data, such as text (masking, reversing word order), audio (adding reverberation or noise), and video (introducing frame loss or blur). However, quantifying the specific impact of such corruption on each modality is quite difficult. For instance, determining the equivalent effect of adding a certain decibel level of noise to audio, or masking corresponding words, if a frame in a video is completely missing, is particularly difficult. Therefore, we introduce noise on the embedding to strike a balance between realism and analytical feasibility.\n\nBased on the reasons above, we select those two types of noise on the embedding level, bring quantitative loss of information through control of the noise level, and simulate the negative impact on information from noise in reality. To be clear, our noise scheduler is designed to separate the processes of generating and adding noise. Users have the freedom to select or customize any type of noise, provided it can be created as a tensor using a programming language. This design ensures that the choice of noise type does not impact the addition process, offering users significant flexibility to adapt to various data processing needs.",

Given complete multimodal data samples, encompassing acoustic, visual, and lexical components (denoted as 𝑎, 𝑣, and 𝑙 respectively), the embeddings are noted as 𝑬 𝒂 , 𝑬 𝒗 , and 𝑬 𝒍 . We use 𝑬 𝒂 as an example to illustrate the process of making incomplete data.\n\nFor constructing the noisy embedding using Gaussian noise, we build a noise schedule across time steps represented by 𝛽 s : However, this method is computationally intensive. To optimize this process for directly obtaining 𝑬 𝒂 𝑻 from 𝑬 𝒂 0 without iterating through each intermediate step from 𝑬 1 to 𝑬 𝑻 -1 , we precompute the cumulative product of 1 -𝛽 terms, denoted as ᾱ𝑡 :\n\nIt significantly reduces computational complexity, which reflects the total variance retained in the data up to step 𝑇 . Utilizing ᾱ𝑡 , the noisy embedding 𝑬 𝒂 𝑻 is obtained from 𝑬 𝒂 0 with a single update:\n\nwhere 𝝐 is a freshly sampled noise vector from a Gaussian distribution, 𝝐 ∼ N (0, 1). This method enables an efficient bypass of the sequential update steps, directly synthesizing the noisy vector at any time step 𝑇 that we desired. For impulse noise, the sampled noise vector 𝝐 consists only of random values 1s and -1s. An appearance frequency 𝑝 is employed to adjust its values, setting 1 -𝑝 percent of them to zero and leaving the remaining 𝑝 percent unchanged. This adjustment introduces noise to 𝑝 percent of data. Then we still use Equation 3 to get 𝑬 𝒂 𝑻 .",

Therefore, we better quantify the noise intensity by calculating the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) between the original and noisy data, in other words, the intensity ratio between noise and raw data.\n\nIn Equation  3 , we regard √ ᾱ𝑇 and √ 1 -ᾱ𝑇 as the power of the original data part and the noise part, separately. According to Equation 2 and 5, it's easy to know that when 𝜎 2 is invariant, the SNR value shares the opposite trend with 𝑇 growing. Hence we can obtain a higher level of noise by increasing the value of 𝑇 .\n\nwhere the 𝜎 2 is the variance of the original data. More intuitively, SNR is always represented in decibels(dB):\n\nAccording to Equation 2 and 5, it's easy to know that when 𝜎 2 is invariant, the SNR value shares the opposite trend with 𝑇 growing. Hence we can obtain a higher level of noise by increasing the value of 𝑇 . Due to the variance differences across different datasets and modalities, we select a distinct T-value for each modality to maintain a uniform noise level. For instance, within the CMU-MOSEI dataset, we adjust the 𝑇 -value for 𝑎, 𝑣, and 𝑙 modalities to [140, 60, 5] respectively to introduce noise at -10dB. By doing so, we are able to impose a similar level of noise on different datasets and modalities, which simulate diverse levels of information loss.",

The Specificity Encoders, employing LSTM  [18]  and TextCNN  [21]  structures, are tasked with extracting modality-specific emotion features 𝒉 ′ from each modality, which is achieved by mapping the embeddings of different modalities into distinct vector spaces. Concurrently, the Invariance Encoder, utilizing a linear structure, extracts modality-invariant emotion features 𝑯 ′ across various modalities by mapping these embeddings into a unified vector space  [26, 41] . Upon sending the concatenated features 𝒉 ′ and 𝑯 ′ into the VAE model, the VAE Encoder compresses and maps them, yielding mean and variance parameters within the latent space. This step effectively translocates the feature representation from the original data space to a probabilistic distribution in the latent space. A stochastic sampling process, facilitated by the reparameterization trick  [22] , then generates samples that reflect this latent space distribution. These samples embody the latent representations of the input features.\n\nSubsequently, these latent variables pass through the decoder network. The decoder reconstructs the feature, remapping it to the original data space, thereby producing a reconstructed multimodal joint representation denoted as 𝑪. Notably, the invariant feature 𝑯 ′ plays a pivotal role during decoding, guiding the model to focus on the common emotional features in the multimodal data.\n\nNoisy features are transformed into normal ones throughout the compression, sampling, and reconstruction phases, which provide the denoising effect.

For instance, under -10dB Gaussian noise in the IEMOCAP dataset, NMER's WA is 0.7598 compared to 0.7120 for MEN, 0.7215 for MCTN, 0.7551 for MMIN, and 0.7543 for IF-MMIN. UA results show a similar pattern.\n\n2) There is a notable difference in accuracy (mainly in high-level noise conditions, for example -40dB, about 6% -10%) between the complete-modality baseline (MEN) and the incomplete-modality baselines (MCTN, MMIN, and IF-MMIN) as shown in Table  2 , which indicates the importance of using incomplete training data.\n\n3) The results of our model on both datasets under six incomplete conditions are detailed in Table  3  (taking Gaussian noise as an example), the WA values for single clean modality conditions {𝑎} and {𝑣} drop by about 9% with the noise intensity increases from -10dB to -40dB, whereas in two clean modalities conditions {𝑎, 𝑣}, {𝑣, 𝑙}, and {𝑣, 𝑙}, the decrease is slower, ranging from about 2% -4%. When modality 𝑎 or 𝑣 is noise-influenced, the performance decreases are roughly equivalent. This indicates that the resistance of the model to noise worsens significantly when only one modality is noisefree. However, the model shows relative robustness when the two modalities are noise-free. Notably, modality 𝑙 plays a critical role in maintaining performance even when other modalities are compromised by noise. The WA value decreased about 4% when only modality l is clean, and about 2% when two modalities including 𝑙 are noise-free (condition {𝑣, 𝑙} and {𝑣, 𝑙}).\n\n4) The WA and UA results on the CMU-MOSEI dataset, as shown in Table  2 , exhibit different trends and absolute values compared to those on the IEMOCAP dataset, primarily due to the imbalanced label distribution (as shown in Table  1 ). In such scenarios, classifiers are inclined to categorize samples into the more samples class because this strategy statistically enhances their accuracy performance. Because of the way the WA value is calculated, if the classification performance of the larger number samples class is good, then even if the noise increases, the weighted accuracy (WA) may not decrease significantly as long as the prediction for that class remains accurate. Because that class contributes more to the overall accuracy, the decline in the accuracy of fewer sample class is offset. These reasons result in the different variation trends of WA and UA values.",

These results highlight the effectiveness of our noise scheduler, which allows for precise control over noise intensities and the simulation of various noise conditions. 2) From the accuracy declining and the noise intensity increasing process in Table  2 , it becomes crucial to recognize the shortcomings of previous studies that used zero vectors or drops data to simulate noise. These methods lack rationality and precise control over noise intensity and fail to enable meaningful comparisons across different noise types and intensities. In contrast, the experiments demonstrate the utility of our method in managing noises, achieving more comprehensive evaluations of the models.\n\n3) In Table  4 , we test the uni-modality result on the IEMOCAP dataset using Gaussian noise. The results in the first row show that different modalities have different quantities of information and difficulties of recognition. The performance of different modalities at the same noise level shows that different data types (audio, video, lexical) have different sensitivity to ambient noise. For example, the video (𝑣) modality has a greater performance degradation at -10dB (about 15%) than the audio (𝑎) and lexical (𝑙) modalities (about 10%). With the incremental noise intensities (from 0dB to -40dB), the accuracy of each modality has its own downtrend. This downward trend highlights the difficulty of effective emotion recognition in high-noise environments, while also providing data support for the importance of multimodal fusion strategies. This table emphasizes the necessity and superiority of multimodal joint representation learning at the same time. When one mode is seriously disturbed, other modes may still be able to maintain good recognition performance, thus improving the overall emotion recognition accuracy.",

This expands the boundaries of current research. Traditionally, models could rely on at least one clean modality. However, this new setup eliminates such possibilities, demanding greater robustness and denoising capability from the models themselves. With noise affecting all modalities, the accuracy significantly decreases. For instance, in Table  5 , on the IEMOCAP dataset, the WA value of the MMIN model falls by about 4% from -10dB to -20dB noise levels and further declines by approximately 13% at -40dB. It indicates that the traditional multimodal fusion strategy may not be able to effectively deal with the simultaneous modal degradation, exposing the limitations of existing techniques against cross-modal interference.\n\n2) There is a noticeable acceleration in performance degradation as noise intensity increases, which may be caused by the non-linear nature of emotion data and the complex response of models to varying noise levels. This information loss complicates the interaction between different modalities. Notably, all models demonstrate a similar trend under this condition.
