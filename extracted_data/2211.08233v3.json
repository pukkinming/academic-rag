      "text": "Speech emotion recognition (SER) plays a vital role in improving the interactions between humans and machines by inferring human emotion and affective states from speech signals. Whereas recent works primarily focus on mining spatiotemporal information from hand-crafted features, we explore how to model the temporal patterns of speech emotions from dynamic temporal scales. Towards that goal, we introduce a novel temporal emotional modeling approach for SER, termed Temporal-aware bI-direction Multi-scale Network (TIM-Net), which learns multi-scale contextual affective representations from various time scales. Specifically, TIM-Net first employs temporal-aware blocks to learn temporal affective representation, then integrates complementary information from the past and the future to enrich contextual representations, and finally fuses multiple time scale features for better adaptation to the emotional variation. Extensive experimental results on six benchmark SER datasets demonstrate the superior performance of TIM-Net, gaining 2.34% and 2.61% improvements of the average UAR and WAR over the second-best on each corpus.

      "text": "Speech emotion recognition (SER) is to automatically recognize human emotion and affective states from speech signals, enabling machines to communicate with humans emotionally  [1] . It becomes increasingly important with the development of the human-computer interaction technique.\n\nThe key challenge in SER is how to model emotional representations from speech signals. Traditional methods  [2, 3]  focus on the efficient extraction of hand-crafted features, †: Co-corresponding author.\n\nwhich are fed into conventional machine learning methods, such as Support Vector Machine (SVM). More recent methods based on deep learning techniques aim to learn the class-discriminative features in an end-to-end manner, which employ various architectures such as Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)  [4, 5] , Recurrent Neural Network (RNN)  [6, 7] , or the combination of CNN and RNN  [8] .\n\nIn particular, various temporal modeling approaches, such as Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), Gate Recurrent Unit (GRU), and Temporal Convolution Network (TCN), are widely adopted in SER, aiming to capture dynamic temporal variations of speech signals. For example, Wang et al.  [7]  proposed a dual-level LSTM to harness temporal information from different time-frequency resolutions. Zhong et al.  [9]  used CNN with Bi-GRU and focal loss for learning integrated spatiotemporal features. Rajamani et al.  [6]  presented an attention-based ReLU within GRU to capture long-range interactions among the features. Zhao et al.  [8]  leveraged fully CNN and Bi-LSTM to learn the spatiotemporal features. However, these methods suffer from the following drawbacks: 1) they lack sufficient capacity to capture longrange dependencies for context modeling, where the capture of the context in speech is crucial for SER since human emotions are usually highly context-dependent; and 2) they do not explore the dynamic receptive field of the model, while learning dynamic instead of maximal ones can improve model generalization ability to unknown data or corpus.\n\nTo overcome these limitations in SER, we propose a Temporal-aware bI-direction Multi-scale Network, termed TIM-Net, which is a novel temporal emotional modeling approach to learn multi-scale contextual affective representations from various time scales. The contributions are threefold. First, we propose a temporal-aware block based on the Dilated Causal Convolution (DC Conv) as a core unit in TIM-Net. The dilated convolution can enlarge and refine the receptive field of temporal patterns. The causal convolution combined with dilated convolution can help model relax the assumption of first-order Markov property compared with",

In this way, we can incorporate an 𝑁-order (𝑁 denotes the number of all previous frames) connection into the network to aggregate information from different temporal locations. Second, we devise a novel bi-direction architecture integrating complementary information from the past and the future for modeling long-range temporal dependencies. To the best of our knowledge, TIM-Net is the first bi-direction temporal network by focusing on multi-scale fusion in the SER, rather than simply concatenating forward and backward hidden states. Third, we design a dynamic fusion module by combining dynamic receptive fields for learning the interdependencies at different temporal scales, so as to improve the model generalizability. Due to the articulation speed and pause time varying significantly across speakers, the speech requires different efficient receptive fields (i.e., the time scale that reflects the affective characteristics) for each low-level feature (e.g., MFCC).",

      "text": "We propose a novel temporal emotional modeling approach called TIM-Net, which learns long-range emotional dependencies from the forward and backward directions and captures multi-scale features at frame-level. Fig.  1  presents the detailed network architecture of TIM-Net. For learning multiscale representations with long-range dependencies, the TIM-Net consists of 𝑛 Temporal-Aware Blocks (TABs) in both forward and backward directions with different temporal receptive fields. Next, we detail each component.\n\nTemporal-aware block. We design the TAB to capture dependencies between different frames and automatically select the affective frames, severing as a core unit of TIM-Net. As shown in Fig.  1 , T denotes a TAB, each of which consists of two sub-blocks and a sigmoid function 𝜎(•) to learn temporal attention maps A, so as to produce the temporal-aware feature 𝑭 by element-wise production of the input and A.\n\nFor the two identical sub-blocks of the 𝑗-th TAB T 𝑗 , each sub-block starts by adding a DC Conv with the exponentially increasing dilated rate 2 𝑗 -1 and causal constraint. The dilated convolution enlarges and refines the receptive field and the causal constraint ensures that the future information is not leaked to the past. The DC Conv is then followed by a batch normalization, a ReLU function, and a spatial dropout.\n\nBi-direction temporal modeling. To integrate complementary information from the past and the future for the judgement of emotion polarity and modeling long-range temporal dependencies, we devise a novel bi-direction architecture based on the multi-scale features as shown in Fig.  1 . For- mally, for the ì T 𝑗+1 in the forward direction with the input ì 𝑭 𝑗 from previous TAB, the output ì 𝑭 𝑗+1 is given by Eq. (  1 ):\n\nwhere ì 𝑭 0 comes from the output of the first 1 × 1 Conv layer and the backward direction can be defined similarly in Eq.  (2) .\n\nWe then combine bidirectional semantic dependencies and compact global contextual representation at utterance level to perceive context as follows:\n\nwhere the global temporal pooling operation G takes an average over temporal dimension, yielding a representation vector for one specific receptive field from the 𝑗-th TAB.\n\nMulti-scale dynamic fusion. Furthermore, since the pronunciation habits (e.g., speed or pause time) vary from speaker to speaker, the utterances have the characteristics of temporal scale variation. SER benefits from taking dynamic temporal receptive fields into consideration. We design the dynamic fusion module to adaptively process speech input at different scales, aiming to determine suitable temporal scale for the current input during the training phase. We adopt a weighted summation operation to fuse the features with Dynamic Receptive Fields (DRF) fusion weights 𝒘 drf from different TABs. The DRF fusion is defined as follows:\n\nwhere 𝒘 drf = [𝑤 1 , 𝑤 2 , . . . , 𝑤 𝑛 ] T are trainable parameters.\n\nOnce the emotional representation 𝒘 drf is generated with great discriminability, we can simply use one fully-connected layer with the softmax function for emotion classification.",

CASIA  [20]  is a Chinese corpus collected from 4 Chinese speakers exhibiting 6 emotional states. EMODB  [21]  is a German corpus that covers 7 emotions by 10 German speakers. EMOVO  [22]  is an Italian corpus recorded by 6 Italian speakers simulating 7 emotional states. IEMOCAP  [23]  is an English corpus that covers 4 emotions from 10 American speakers. RAVDESS  [24]  is an English corpus of 8 emotions by 24 British speakers. SAVEE  [25]  is an English corpus recorded by 4 British speakers in 7 emotions. Implementation details. In the experiments, 39-dimensional MFCCs are extracted from the Librosa toolbox  [26] . The cross-entropy criterion is used as the objective function and the overall epoch is set to 500. Adam algorithm is adopted to optimize the model with an initial learning rate 𝛼 = 0.001, and a batch size of 64. To avoid over-fitting during the training phase, we implement label smoothing with factor 0.1 as a form of regularization. For the 𝑗-th TAB T 𝑗 , there are 39 kernels of size 2 in Conv layers, the dropout rate is 0.1, and the dilated rate is 2 𝑗 -1 . To guarantee that the maximal receptive field covers the input sequences, we set the number of TAB 𝑛 in both directions to 10 for IEMOCAP and 8 for others. For fair comparisons with the SOTA approaches in experiments, following previous works  [2, 16, 18] , we mainly perform 10fold cross-validation (CV) with 90% training data and 10% testing data in one fold to evaluate fitting ability of the model. To evaluate the generalization ability of the model, we further conduct experiments on six corpora under another evaluation setting. As shown in Table  1 , the superscript ' * ' implies a 10-fold CV with 90% and 10% samples in train and test sets, whose model is only evaluated at the last epoch using the testing set. Evaluation metrics. Due to the class imbalance, we use two widely-used metrics, Weighted Average Recall (WAR) (i.e., accuracy) and Unweighted Average Recall (UAR), to evaluate the performance of each method. WAR uses the class probabilities to balance the recall metric of different classes while UAR treats each class equally.",

      "text": "Comparison with SOTA methods. To demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach on each corpus, we select representative approaches on each corpus following the 10-fold CV strategy. Table  1  presents the overall results on 6 corpora, showing that our method significantly and consistently outperforms all these compared methods by a large margin. Remarkably, our approach gains 2.34% and 2.61% improvements of the average UAR and WAR scores than the second-best on each corpus under the second evaluating setting. However, most previous methods focus on evaluating the fitting ability of the model, leading to overfitting issues. We further evaluate the generalization ability of the model under another evaluation setting. As shown in Table  1 , although performance has declined, the TIM-Net still has competitive performance and good generalization ability on several corpora. Fig.  2  shows that TIM-Net does not exhibit significant overfitting issues, and its convergence curves remain relatively stable. Moreover, it can be observed that the affective discrimination ability of TIM-Net in short-term speech (e.g., CASIA, EMODB, EMOVO, and RAVDESS) is generally stronger than that in long-term speech (e.g., IEMO-CAP and SAVEE), which means that long-term dependence is still a challenging issue. Please refer to our GitHub repo 1  for extra experimental details and results.  Visualization of learned affective representation. To investigate the impact of TIM-Net on representation learning, we visualize the representations learned by TIM-Net and GM-TCN  [14]  through the t-SNE technique  [27]  in Fig.  3 . For a fair comparison, we first use the same 8:2 hold-out validation on CASIA corpus for the two methods, and visualize the representations of the same test data after an identical training phase. Although GM-TCN also focuses on multi-scale and temporal modeling. The generalization of the model to unseen domain/corpus is critically important for SER. Inspired by the domain-adaptation study in CAAM  [17] , we likewise validate the generalizability of TIM-Net on the cross-corpus SER task, following the same experimental setting as CAAM except that TIM-Net does not have access to the target domain. Specifically, we likewise choose 5 emotional classes for a fair comparison, i.e., angry, fear, happy, neutral, and sad, shared among these 5 corpora (except for IEMOCAP, which has only 4 emotions). These 5 corpora form 20 cross-corpus combinations. And we report the average UAR and WAR, and their standard deviation from 10 random runs for each task in Table  2 .\n\nThe performance of TCN over different corpora is close to random guessing with odds equal to 25%, and TIM-Net has a significant improvement over TCN. Surprisingly, TIM- Net outperforms CAAM, one latest task-specific domainadaptation method. The results suggest that our TIM-Net is effective in modeling emotion with strong generalizability.",

The results of ablation studies are shown in Table  3 . We have the following observations. First, all components contribute positively to the overall performance. Second, our method achieves 8.31% and 8.41% performance gains in UAR and WAR over TCN that also utilizes DC Conv. Since the inability of TCN to capture contextual multi-scale features, capturing intra-and interdependencies at different temporal scales is critical to SER. Third, when removing the backward TABs or multi-scale strategy, the results substantially drop due to the weaker capacity to model temporal dependencies and perceive the sentimental features with different scales. Finally, TIM-Net without dynamic fusion performs worse than TIM-Net, which verifies the benefits of deploying dynamic fusion to adjust the model adaptively.",
