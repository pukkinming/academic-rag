      "text": "Speech signal processing involves analyzing speech signals and developing techniques to process them for effective communication between humans and machines. Speech signals are 1D, time-varying signals that are a manifestation of acoustic description of human language  [1] . These signals are generally (a) non-stationary, (b) large dynamic range, and (c) rich spectral content, which can be challenging to analyze.\n\nIn speech signal processing, convolution plays an important role. When a speech signal s(t) is transmitted or recorded in a communication channel, it is changed by the channel impulse response h(t). Received signal r(t) can be expressed as a convolution between speech signal and channel impulse response:\n\nThis equation models the interaction between the speech signal and the channel, incorporating effects such as echo, reverberation, and attenuation.\n\nIf noise n(t) is added, the received signal becomes:\n\nThe existence of noise makes it difficult to reconstruct the priori speech signal.\n\nConvolution is also employed for feature extraction in the speech domain, such as calculating the frequency content of speech. The filtered speech signal can be convolved with a sequence of filters to realize time-frequency representations such as short-time Fourier transform, which are important for speech recognition and speaker labeling  [1] ,  [13] . These methods derive articulatory and prosodic features of speech Further, speech signal heterogeneity-that is, heterogeneity of the signals arising from speakers, accents, speech rate, and emotional states-introduces the challenge of complexity. Convolutional approaches must account for this heterogeneity. Yet, the issues, e.g., background noise, reverberation and real-world speech signal mixing, continue to be problems. Convolutional approaches, augmented with statistical signal processing, is an active research area for achieving robustness and performance in speech processing systems  [9] ,  [19] . These methods are also the basis of developments in voice-based technology, automatic transcription and voice biometrics. In these architectures, convolutional layers are used to successively extract features of speech signals. Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) apply convolutional layers for fast feature extraction, whereas Convolutional Complex Architectures (Conformers) apply convolution along with self-attention for the local and global relationships. CRNNs combine convolutional and recurrent layers to learn temporal dynamics, and ResNets exploit shortcut connections to build deeper architectures without performance overfitting. Collectively, these architectures increase the accuracy of speech signal processing, including in noisy and dynamic environments.",

In convolutional neural networks (CNNs) layers with trainable filters convolutional layers are employed to slide across the input data and learn local patterns. The one-dimensional convolution operation is written as follows with a temporal input sequence x(t) and a convolution kernel w(k):\n\nOutput y(t) is defined where temporal dependencies are encoded, which are the basis for efficient speech signal processing  [3] . CNNs make use of two-dimensional convolutions in time and frequency, which are as follows when applied to spectrograms:\n\nwhere S(i, j) is the spectrogram value at time i and frequency j, and W (m, n) is a filter. This lets CNNs also learn the frequency features specific to speech recognition tasks  [22] . Pooling layers, e.g., max pooling, downsample spatial resolution and retain global features (i.e., lead to higher translation invariance). Given a feature map y(i, j), max-pooling over a window size p × q is defined as:\n\nBatch normalization also stabilizes and speeds up training by normalizing layer outputs. For an activation a with mean µ and variance σ 2 , the normalized output is:\n\nwhere γ and β are learnable parameters  [4] . Categorical cross-entropy loss is the rule-of-thumb for CNN classification and is formulated as follows with the predicted probabilities ŷi and the associated true labels y i :\n\nwhere C denotes the number of classes. This loss function contributes to effective feature learning that can be applied to a few tasks, e.g., automatic speech recognition (ASR)  [1] .\n\nThe usefulness of CNNs as an engine for extracting hierarchical patterns from spectrograms has long been shown. Sainath and Parada  [23]  applied CNNs for noisy large vocabulary continuous speech recognition (LVCSR) and showed the model's robust nature, while Abdel-Hamid et al.  [22]  demonstrated CNNs' superiority in phoneme recognition. CNNs are useful for speaker ID and verification because CNNs are able to learn speaker-specific features  [15] .\n\nCNNs are tractable for high-bandwidth communication systems since, from the statistical signal processing viewpoint, CNNs are naturally expressive for feature extraction from the perfect specification. Specifically, the signal processing efficiency was highlighted in the future 5G communication system  [3] ,  [7] .",

This architecture is particularly appropriate for problems that need to extract local features as well as longrange temporal dependencies.\n\nInitially, CRNNs apply a series of convolutional layers to extract spatial features from an input spectrogram S(i, j), where i and j denote the time and frequency dimensions.

In applications ranging from security systems, personalized user interfaces, and forensic investigation, this task is extremely crucial. Convolution-based architectures have been instrumental in enhancing the accuracies and robustness of speech-recognition systems by capturing the unique variability in each person's voice.\n\nThe main task in speaker identification is to estimate the probability P (S|X) that a certain speaker S is spoken for a set of acoustic feature sequences X = {x 1 , x 2 , . . . , x t }. This can be formulated using Bayesian inference as:\n\nHere, P (X|S), P (S), and P (X) are the acoustic model, prior probability of the speaker, and evidence, respectively.\n\nConvolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) have been applied with success to model P (X|S) through learning hierarchical features of the input acoustic representations, such as Mel-Frequency Cepstral Coefficients (MFCCs)  [15] . The convolutional operation of CNNs for use in speaker identification can be written as:\n\nWhere Y i,j is the output feature map x i,j is the input feature map, w m,n is the convolutional kernel weights, b is the bias, and σ is the activation function.\n\nConvolutional Recurrent Neural Networks (CRNNs) approximate spatial and temporal relationships in speech signals by combining convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and recurrent networks (e.g., Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks)  [11] .

For instance, Na et al. As demonstrated in  [15] , CNNs with noise-resistant feature extraction techniques dramatically improve the effectiveness of speaker recognition in the presence of acoustic background noise. In addition, by combining GMM and CNN, hybrid models have enabled real-time speaker recognition at good accuracy  [17] .\n\nGenerally, convolution-based architectures are naturally suited to statistical signal processing paradigms for the ability to learn robust features as well as model subject speaker properties.",

Prabhu and Raj 1 demonstrated that CNNs can be applied to discriminative fine emotional cues by the learning of abstract features from the convolution of the spectrogram.\n\nFurthermore, CNN-LSTM networks as proposed by Kumar and Sharma  [16]  incorporate temporal dynamics of speech for an improvement of the emotion classification performance. These hybrid models combine the local feature extraction capabilities of CNNs with the sequence modeling strengths of LSTMs, providing a comprehensive framework for emotion detection.\n\nConceptually, convolution-based architectures are consistent with principles of statistical signal processing by providing discriminative feature learning and good models of emotionality for speech signals.
